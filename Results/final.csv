 1️⃣ A cheat sheet of tech acquisitions in Southeast Asia 
 Southeast Asia has seen its fair share of M&amp;A deals over the years, so here’s  a list  of those that have taken place, broken down by company, country, acquirer, and vertical. An interesting fact from the piece: Gojek takes the lead with the most acquisitions, making eight M&amp;A deals so far – two times more than the runners-up. 
 2️⃣ Insurtech: An industry to watch 
 Look out: Insurance tech could be an industry to watch. In 2019, about US$7.3 billion was invested in insurtech, up from US$5.6 billion in 2018 as  reported by Crunchbase . While funding for insurtech has slowed down significantly this year, with only US$2.6 billion raised from the start of the year to July 22, we still have half a year more to go. 
 One Southeast Asian insurtech startup to highlight is Singlife, which secured US$90 million from Japan’s Sumitomo Life in 2019. In the same year, Singlife also managed to  triple its revenue , achieving US$171 million in total income, up from US$54 million in 2018. 
 3️⃣ Are private markets the new public markets? 
 This article  explains  why public markets are losing steam. Some of the reasons include companies borrowing money instead and startups raising through VC firms like SoftBank, Sequoia, and East Ventures – a route that might be potentially faster, more efficient, and cheaper than a public offering. Businesses these days, which have their assets mostly parked online,  also require less capital than firms in the past, which needed  to build factories to operate. 
 4️⃣ A long-term look at public to private equity in the US 
 A new   report published by Morgan Stanley  offers a ton of information into topics like the shift from public to private equities in the US. It also covers issues like the drop in number of public companies compared to 25 years ago — though companies these days are much larger and older on average, and exits which used to be done via IPOs are now shifting to sales to other firms. 
 “Venture capital is more cyclical than either public markets or buyouts, and recent annual investment levels have been high,” the report reads.

 Launched in 2013, Chilindo is a popular ecommerce auctions platform in Thailand that allows users to place bids and pay the price for products covering fashion and accessories, home and garden products, family and kids, electronics and gadgets, among others. 
 It uses a pure auction model where all products start from just THB 1 (US$0.03). There’s no reserve price, that is, the lowest price the seller is willing to accept for an item. 
 It’s able to offer cheap products because of a consumer-to-manufacturer model, that is, it cuts out the middlemen by shipping goods straight from the factory to the doorstep. 
  See:  The under-the-radar ecommerce startup that’s taking Thailand and Malaysia by storm   
 The company says it’s currently serving over 15 million customers and delivering more than 900,000 orders monthly. 
 It is up against rivals such as Alibaba’s Lazada, Sea’s Shopee and JD Central, a joint venture between Thai’s Central Group and China’s ecommerce giant JD.com. 
 According to J.P.Morgan, the online shopping sector, taking up just 0.8% of the total retail market, is valued at  US$26.2 billion  in the country. 
 Considered as a mobile-first country, the mobile commerce market is the dominant ecommerce sales channel in Thailand, accounting for 52% of all online transactions, the report said. It also noted that the US$13.6 billion worth market is expected to grow by 16.4% at a compound annual growth rate and generate US$25 billion in annual sales by 2021. 
 CP Group owns Thailand’s telco operator True Corporation, which won 5G licenses in February.True Corporation recently formed a partnership with China’s telco company ZTE Corporation to build a commercial 5G network in Thailand. With its 5G internet, it could help with the rise of mobile commerce. 
 “Chilindo’s plan to enter the international ecommerce market will increase the ability of Thai ecommerce brands to compete on an international level,” Chearavanont said.

 Hello readers, 
 Reading or writing news about layoffs already ain’t easy; what more for those who have to go through them? 😭 If you’ve ever wondered why they have to happen, my colleague Willis Wee wrote a reflective piece on it. 
 Scroll down for the bullet points or jump straight into  the full piece here . 
  But first, your quick bytes for today:  
   
 1️⃣ GoPay is available on YouTube in Indonesia 
 You can now pay for your YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions in Indonesia using  GoPay , Gojek’s digital wallet and payment solutions platform. This came after Gojek had  received  investment from Google, along with Facebook, PayPal, and Tencent, to boost digital financial services in Asia. Would we see more of such tie-ups in the near future? 
 2️⃣ Microsoft wants all of TikTok 
 What supposedly was a discussion to buy over TikTok’s US business has  evolved  into Microsoft asking to buy all of TikTok’s global business — India and Europe included. 
 3️⃣ China’s home-grown digital currency is on the way 
 China’s major state banks have started  testing  a digital wallet application for transferring money and making payments. 
 4️⃣ US ban on WeChat and TikTok 
 The Trump administration has announced that it will be  banning  Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat, as well as their parent companies ByteDance and Tencent, in the US starting in 45 days. This block would not only make it difficult for WeChat users residing in the US to communicate with their friends and families, it might also affect the American companies where Tencent is an investor: Snap, Activision Blizzard, and the makers of  Fortnite  and  League of Legends . 
 5️⃣ Drones for social distancing in Singapore 
 Please keep apart, drones are  watching : Singapore has gotten help from Israel’s Airobotics to trial two pilotless drones in order to enforce social-distancing measures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. 
 6️⃣ Unicorns by country 
 The Hurun Research Institute has just released the  Global Unicorn List 2020 , and while the US continues to sit on the top spot with 233 unicorns, China is closing in fast in second place with 227. Third-placer UK was miles away with 24, followed by India with 21. 
 
 Making sense of the senseless layoffs 
   
 If someone had said last year that LinkedIn, Airbnb, and Grab would be laying off employees in 2020, most of us would have reacted, “Are you mad?” But this year continues to prove to be a lot different than the ones before it. Still, amid all the layoffs and employee complaints, there are  some lessons  to take away from these highly unpredictable times: 
 
 
 Knowledge is key:  Companies in the ideal zone (D) might give you stability and perks, but when they do conduct layoffs, they’re going to hurt — bad. Meanwhile, for those in the growth zone (B), work life might be exciting but it comes at the expense of stability. Knowing which quadrant your company belongs to could prepare you for any potential heartbreak. 
 
 Shoutout to the founders:  “Grow and grow and grow!” had been the mantra of tech investors until WeWork’s  downfall  happened. And before everyone knew it, the spotlight shifted to profitability. 
 
 Read more:   The piece “Making sense of the senseless layoffs in tech”  goes deeper into the “short term-ism” mindset that’s pervasive in the industry and urges founders to enter the tech scene “with eyes wide open.”

 We asked our community if ESOPs are important… 
    
 Earlier this week, we published an  article on ESOPs  or employee stock option plans and how Indonesia tech workers might not be totally on board with it yet. 
 This got us thinking: What about our community? Would they prefer a lower salary with ESOP, or a higher salary without ESOP? We posted this question on our  Telegram  channel and about 180 people responded. 
 Results are close, but it seems that more people still enjoy the instant gratification of receiving cash. If you have a different opinion, though, feel free to reply to this email and let us know all about it!

653612,Timeline: How TikTok reached global fame and now faces a US ban," TikTok is probably one of the most notable Chinese success stories in tech. With about  800 million monthly active users  and a valuation of around  US$50 billion , the short-video app rose to become a global smash hit in less than three years.

 But its immense popularity has also brought it into the crosshairs of international regulators. It’s now banned in India and is facing the same scenario in the US – its two major overseas markets – over data security concerns. 
 The company is now mulling several options, including a potential sale to US tech giant Microsoft. 
 Here’s a timeline of what has happened so far. 
 Global fame 
  September 2016:  ByteDance launched short-video app Douyin in China. 
  May 2017:  ByteDance launched an international version of Douyin called TikTok. 
  November 2017 : ByteDance  acquired  Shanghai-based app Musical.ly reportedly for US$800 million to US$1 billion. With 200 million users, Musical.ly was predominantly used by teens in North America and Europe. 
  See also:  A visual timeline of TikTok’s rise   
  August 2018 : TikTok’s US dominance started as it merged with Musical.ly, which had 100 million monthly active users. The accounts, content, and fan base of its users were migrated to the TikTok app following the merger. 
  In the crosshairs  
  February 2019:  The popular short-video app, downloaded 1 billion times globally, was starting to draw attention from global regulators. In the US, TikTok was  fined  US$5.7 million for illegally collecting the names, email addresses, pictures, and locations of users under the age of 13. With 65 million users in the country, TikTok was the fourth and 25th most popular app on Google and Apple devices, respectively. 
  April 2019 : TikTok was temporarily banned for two weeks in India after a court ruled that it could expose children to inappropriate content, such as pornographic material, as well as sexual predators and cyberbullying. The move caused the app to miss out on potentially acquiring about  15 million  new users, according to one estimate. 
  October 2019 : As the tech war between the US and China continued to rise, US senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton urged the government to investigate the app, saying that “with over 110 million downloads in the US alone, TikTok is a potential counter-intelligence threat we cannot ignore.” 
  December 2019:  US regulators  accused  TikTok of transferring user data to servers in China. The app later clarified that the Chinese government does not have access to its users’ data and personal information and that all data is stored in the US. “There is zero truth to the accusations the Chinese state has access to TikTok users’ data,” said Theo Bertram, head of public policy for Europe at TikTok. 
  April 2020 : TikTok had been downloaded more than  2 billion  times globally. 
 Closed doors 
  May 2020 : ByteDance named Kevin Mayer, Disney’s former head of streaming, as its chief operating officer and CEO of TikTok. He reports directly to ByteDance founder and CEO Yiming Zhang. 
 The move was deemed essential for the company as it would ramp up its expansion plans for TikTok and further boost its international presence. Moreover,  Mayer could help ByteDance  address barriers hindering the app’s global expansion. 
  July 2020:  India  banned TikTok  and 58 other Chinese apps due to a “threat to sovereignty and integrity” amid an India-China border stand-off. India was TikTok’s biggest driver in new downloads,  generating nearly 660 million installs since 2017. 
 TikTok also  exited Hong Kong , as the city introduced a new national security law that grants expanded powers to the mainland Chinese government. 
  August 2020:  US President Donald Trump said that he would  ban TikTok in the US  over concerns that the app would collect Americans’ personal data. 
 ByteDance has since been considering several options. It previously intended to keep a minority stake in the US business of TikTok. It’s also looking to establish  separate headquarters  for the app outside of China in an effort to distance TikTok from its Chinese roots. 
 Now, Microsoft is pursuing talks for a potential takeover of the app. The company is looking to complete the discussions by September 15. 
 ByteDance’s Zhang and its investors, however, were reportedly  reluctant  to sell the app to Microsoft and might agree to a complete spin-off of TikTok instead. 
 However, while talks are still ongoing, Trump has signed two executive orders  banning  any US transactions with ByteDance, as well as WeChat operator Tencent. TikTok has about 80 million monthly active users in the US.

653966,70% of Southeast Asian consumers to go digital this year: report," The number of digital consumers in Southeast Asia is growing in a much quicker pace than expected, with higher spending power and increased preference for contactless transactions as key drivers. 
   
 Global consulting firm Bain &amp; Company projected last year that the number of digital consumers – those that have purchased a product or service online in the past 12 months – in the region will reach around 310 million by 2025. 
 In its follow-up report titled “ Digital Consumers of Tomorrow, Here Today ,” done in collaboration with Facebook, the company now expects Southeast Asia to reach that number this year. This means that almost 70% of consumers in the region will go digital about five years earlier than previously forecasted. 
 The study surveyed approximately 16,500 digital consumers and gathered insights from over 20 chief experience officers across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The respondents were consumers who have made an online purchase in at least two product categories in the past three months. 
  Rapidly increasing online spending  
 The study found that the average spend per consumer will more than triple to US$429 in 2025 from US$124 in 2018. This exceeds Bain’s previous 2025 forecast of about US$392. 
 A key driver to the uptick this year is a significant lift in spending power across Southeast Asia compared to 2019. Data from the report showed that spending patterns between tier-one and tier-two cities have narrowed in the past 12 months. 
   
 “Southeast Asia is a dynamic region and is fast growing to be one of the top growth engines for the global digital economy,” Bain partner Praneeth Yendamuri said. “Looking forward, online spending is expected to triple by 2025 and reach close to US$150 billion.” 
 Along with this growth comes the consumers’ tendency to buy into more categories online. According to the report, purchases in categories such as clothing, electronics, personal care, beauty, and household appliances grew by around 1.5x since last year. 
 Seeing a much larger increase is the online groceries category, which grew by 2x to 2.5x compared to 2019. According to the report, 43% of respondents in Southeast Asia have done their groceries online. 
  Opportunities to seize  
 Bain and Facebook also noted that contactless and home-consumption habits are expected to continue despite the easing of physical distancing measures. This presents several opportunities for businesses. 
 “With five years of digital acceleration condensed into one, the impact of digital adoption on businesses has never been more apparent,” Facebook’s Asia-Pacific managing director of gaming Sandhya Devanathan said. “It is vital for businesses to connect with consumers in ways that are frictionless and to replicate in-person interactions through social platforms, messaging, and short videos as much as possible to drive discovery and loyalty.” 
 According to the report, 68% of consumers don’t know what they want to purchase before they shop, making discovery commerce an all-important area. 
 Moreover, 62% of consumers learn about new products and brands via social platforms, with short videos as their top format of choice. 
   
 E-wallet adoption also continues to rise. About 22% of respondents now prefer to pay with their e-wallets, up from just 14% last year. 
 While cash is still king in Southeast Asia, the number of people that prefer to pay with cash went down to 34% compared to 40% in 2019. 
 Bain and Facebook also found that Southeast Asian VC and private equity funds hit a record 0f US$8.7 billion in unspent capital as of the end of last year. This presents opportunities for tech startups in the region to raise more funding and compete on a larger scale. 
 The report suggests that disruption may be more apparent in healthcare, education, and online entertainment segments as consumers gradually adjust to a more digital lifestyle due to the pandemic.

654044,"US bans dealings with TikTok, WeChat"," US President Donald Trump announced Thursday two executive orders that will prohibit any transactions with TikTok operator ByteDance as well as WeChat owner Tencent, as tensions between the US and China continue to escalate. The orders will take effect in 45 days.

 According to Trump, Chinese mobile apps are threatening “the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.” 
 In the executive orders, the president said that both WeChat and TikTok capture “vast swaths of information” from their users. TikTok, with over 175 million downloads in the US and over 1 billion globally, collect information such as location data and browsing and search histories. 
 Trump also noted that the apps censor content that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive. 
 “This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information – potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage,” the US president said in one of the orders. 
 Earlier this month, he also threatened to ban the video-sharing app over concerns that it’s being used to collect Americans’ personal data. TikTok has already been banned in India since June. 
  See:  Timeline: How TikTok reached global fame and now faces a US ban   
 Responding to the executive order, TikTok said it was “ shocked ,” as the order “was issued without any due process.” 
 The company emphasized that it has been engaging with the US government for nearly a year to address the latter’s concerns. “What we encountered instead was that the Administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses,” it said. 
 TikTok also reiterated that it never shares user data with the Chinese government nor censors content at its request. “We even expressed our willingness to pursue a full sale of the US business to an American company,” the company said. 
 Trump’s decision comes as tech giant Microsoft is  pursuing talks  about a potential takeover of TikTok, which is estimated to be valued at  US$50 billion . The company aims to complete the discussions by September 15. 
 Meanwhile, Tencent saw its market value shed about  US$35 billion  as its stock plunged by as much as 10% on Friday following Trump’s order.

653745,The lowdown on outsourcing and offshoring: Which is right for your startup?," With the recent shift of the business landscape due to Covid-19, tech startups and small and medium-sized enterprises will have to keep a close watch on their outgoing expenses and maintain a healthy cash flow for survival.

 Unfortunately, IT labor costs are escalating due to the high global tech demand, which is also causing maintenance expenses in sustaining a good software engineering team to jump significantly. This has led startups to face huge technical debt with only a few software engineers to handle development projects. 
 So instead of letting this happen, leaders should lean toward a combination of outsourcing and offshoring software development as a sensible budget-friendly solution. 
 There are four models to scale your teams: 
 
 Onshore insourcing: work with an in-house tech team in the home country 
 Onshore outsourcing: work with a software consultancy firm in the home country 
 Offshore outsourcing: work with a software consultancy firm in a foreign country 
 Offshore insourcing: work with an in-house tech team in a foreign country 
 
 While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, here are some ideas on which model is best for startups and small businesses from two different angles: 
 
 Cost, control, and performance: Which of the three factors are more important to your company? 
 Growth stage: What is the current growth stage of your company? 
 
    
 Cost 
 If cost is the greatest concern, then offshore outsourcing is the best bet. A trustworthy outsource provider from a lower-wage country can help to reduce up to 70% of a startup’s operational costs. However, it is worth noting that project management will need to be efficient to avoid any hidden costs chipping away from the budget. If founders prefer to keep a good balance between adequate management and sufficient costs, then an offshore team is the optimal option. 
 Control 
 There is no doubt that in-house (onshore or offshore) strategies are the king when it comes to gaining complete control of operations. By keeping things internally, there is less exposure to risk. But startups must keep in mind that having an in-house, onshore team is costly to build and maintain. In some cases, IT talent is simply unavailable in the country where a company is based. 
 Thus, to retain a high level of control without burning through the budget, many firms are building their own offshore teams across the globe, which can save up to 60% of operational costs. 
 Performance 
 Outsourcing is a powerful strategy when you need to deliver a product on a constrained timeline. However, depending on the performance of the outsource provider, the result can vary drastically. 
 On the other hand, having an offshore in-house team means greater performance, since coordination and quality control are only second to an onshore in-house team while the costs are much lower. Therefore, if your priority is long-term planning, you may choose the offshore insourcing strategy. 
    
 Angel, pre-seed, and seed stages 
 Having a small onshore tech team means gaining all the beneficial aspects of operating a team efficiently, including high control/visibility and clear communication. However, firms may not be able to afford the cash burn in the early stages. 
 As a compromise, startups can consider onshore/offshore outsourcing, especially if they don’t have any tech specialists in their teams or need a way to save costs. 
 Outsourcing allows companies to get their first minimum viable product out in the market before committing more funds to build a tech team and a better product. 
 However, we need to bear in mind that while this approach de-risks the initial software development approach, companies will have less control over operations and may be subject to high project costs in the short term. 
 Offshore expansion is not preferred at the early stages due to the time, complexity, and costs of setting up overseas operations. Instead, companies should focus on getting their first software product out in the market to test product-market fit and grow a bigger customer base. 
 On the other hand, if startups are better funded, have more certainty on product direction and market fit, and have good tech leadership, setting up overseas operations will be viable and definitely yield long-term success. 
 Another case of when setting up overseas operations at the early stage makes sense is when founders themselves are willing to travel frequently to (or even base themselves out of) foreign countries together with the offshore tech team. This is pretty challenging for founders but does indeed drive down costs and resolves scaling challenges in the long term. 
 Series A and B stages 
 At series A or B stage, companies would already have some internal tech capabilities to manage a small software development team and deliver on a working software platform. At this point, though, startups may have prioritized speedy delivery over performant code and functions, leading to an accumulation of technical debt. 
 Furthermore, customer feedback and internal business ideation have probably added an overwhelming list of additional functionalities to the product roadmap. As a result, startups’ chief technology officers will need to scale up their tech development resources to keep pace with the business’ growth 
 While onshore expansion is still a viable option, this strategy is not sustainable in the long run due to increasing costs. Though companies have likely raised sizable funding rounds and have good customer traction at these stages, the cash from investments must be conservatively shared between sales, marketing, operations, and product development. 
 At this stage, offshoring to a lower-cost country becomes the next best option, as offshore teams are less expensive to maintain and can work in conjunction with the core onshore team to develop additional functions and modules for the product roadmap. 
 It’s also worth noting that outsourcing (onshore or offshore) should no longer be done at series A or B stage because a tech company eventually needs to own its tech capabilities and not be dependent on external parties. 
 Wrapping it up 
 What we shared above is based on our experience working with many different tech startups at various growth stages. The caveat is that all businesses are unique, and each startup team may have special affinities to specific team scaling models. As an example, if the software development company is a shareholder of the company, it may make sense to strike a win-win bargain by outsourcing to the software development company. 
 Between outsourcing and offshoring, there is no definite right or wrong answer – it really depends on what’s important to the company and whether it is ready to undertake the offshoring journey. ",Frank Lee,0,5,"[(0, 0.6692181), (1, 0.010683947), (3, 0.3200623)]",[],['roadmap']
653898,A cheat sheet of tech acquisitions in Southeast Asia,"  Queena Wadyanti compiled the data for this list.  
 
  Cameron Priest, the CEO of Singapore’s TradeGecko, which was recently acquired by Intuit for  US$80 million  
 
 Southeast Asia has seen its fair share of M&amp;A deals over the years. Some have been blockbuster moves, such as Alibaba’s  US$1 billion  deal to acquire Lazada and Seek’s US$586 million purchase of JobStreet, while others flew under the radar. 
 Data on Southeast Asia’s M&amp;A deals are hard to come by, which is why we’ve put this together. We hope you’ll find it useful. 
 But first, some caveats 
 M&amp;A transactions can be all-stock, cash, or a mix of both, so a high transaction value does not mean shareholders get good returns. Some deals are also made under irregular circumstances: For example, Joyy’s chairman and CEO  is also the CEO of Bigo . 
 We do acknowledge that there are limitations to our dataset. If you see something that’s missing or incorrect, do reach out to us at research@techinasia.com and let us know. And please be nice. 🙂 
 Now, let’s dive in. 
    
  
 Southeast Asia is certainly seeing more M&amp;A deals since we first started tracking the region, with Singapore Press Holding’s  HardwareZone acquisition  being the very first deal on our list. 
 2019 was the peak, clocking in 60 M&amp;As with notable deals including  Bigo  (US$1.45 billion),  Wavecell  (US$125 million),  Coins.ph  (US$72 million), and  Red Dot Payment  (US$65 million). Seven months in and despite the pandemic, 2020 has recorded 27 M&amp;As. If the trend remains constant, the region should see another 19 M&amp;As by the end of this year. 
   ﻿  ﻿  ﻿   ﻿ ﻿   
 While Southeast Asia’s average deal size stands at US$74.7 million, its M&amp;A check sizes are considered small, with a median of US$6 million. Ecommerce, fintech, media, adtech, and social networking-related companies made up almost half of all M&amp;As in the region. 
    
    
 When it comes to M&amp;As by country, Singapore tops the chart, as it is a convenient hub for companies to incorporate. 
    
  
 Interestingly, Gojek has made eight M&amp;A deals so far, two times more than the runners-up. Its acquisitions include  Moka ,  Loket , and  MVCommerce .

653948,Is integrating mobile and web apps the future for SaaS firms?," The new frontier for enterprise software as a service (SaaS) providers appears to be in mobile apps. From cloud storage services like Dropbox to video conferencing tools like Zoom, the number of SaaS mobile apps on the market is on the rise. 
 Almost all the software that enterprises use to manage their businesses and work effectively are available on mobile devices, giving workers greater flexibility and access to whatever they need, whenever they need it. 
 According to Statista, the size of the SaaS market is projected to hit  US$157 billion in 2020 . While desktop platforms are still the backbone of any SaaS product, mobile apps are becoming increasingly important, with the corporate mobile SaaS market expected to be worth  US$7.4 billion  by 2021. 
 Mobile on the rise 
 The increasing prevalence of mobile apps in the SaaS space is the result of shifts in how people access and consume information. 
 Globally, users spend an average of  three hours and 22 minutes  a day on their mobile phones. That number is much higher in emerging markets, where users in countries like the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia spend around five hours a day accessing the internet via their phones. 
 In India, meanwhile, mobile use has  overtaken desktop , with the market share for mobile phones  amounting to double  that of desktops. 
 “The rise in mobile applications is a direct outcome of the usage of mobile phones across the world,” says Saurabh Srivastava, vice president of product at cloud-based business software provider  Deskera . “[People] are spending more time on their phones, and they’re used to doing everything on mobile, like ordering food or doing their banking.” 
 Deskera, for one, is no stranger to running a mobile app – the company launched its own app earlier this year in a bid to make its business management solutions  more accessible to a wider audience .

 Mobile apps also serve as a way for SaaS companies like Deskera to introduce their products to smaller enterprises, who may be less comfortable with technology and more hesitant about shelling out for expensive business management software. 
 A survey conducted by Ernst &amp; Young in 2019 also found that  54.9% of SMEs in Southeast Asia were still in the early stages  of digital innovation. 
 Mobile SaaS apps, therefore, create an opportunity for these companies to  test out new software  on a smaller scale. 
 “[Mobile] gives smaller and less tech-savvy companies an easy way to experience the benefits of such SaaS apps,” explains Saurabh. 
 Toward integration 
 As prevalent as mobile SaaS apps are becoming, Saurabh thinks desktop platforms are not going away anytime soon. 
 “There are certain things that work better on the web platform and on desktops,” he says. “If I’m looking at a spreadsheet or a large amount of data, desktop is still better because mobile screens are not designed to show that kind of information.” 
 And it might not even be about picking one over the other: Enterprises are increasingly conducting their operations  across  both desktop and mobile platforms. 
 As such, SaaS providers are working toward creating products that can flow easily between the two modes. 
 Such mobile-web integrations, according to Saurabh, give users greater flexibility and allows them to work effectively across whatever platform they choose to use. 
 User experience is key 
 That being said, the integrated approach has its challenges. After all, just syncing data across mobile and web platforms is not enough. Companies also need to ensure that their products are designed with user experience in mind. 
 “How does the user want to carry out their business? What do they want to do? Making it more configurable, easier, and intuitive for users is what’s important,” Saurabh says. 
 Deskera aims to do just this with it’s platform, which features a streamlined, user-friendly interface on both its mobile and web app. 
 By consolidating information between its mobile and desktop platforms, Deskera also ensures that both apps are able to work in conjunction. The magic for this lies in application programming interfaces – or APIs – which the company uses to make sure that there is only “one source of truth,” says Saurabh. 
 This creates a seamless experience for the user, who can flawlessly switch between mobile and web versions depending on their needs.

 With Deskera’s platform, for example, companies can set up a database with their customer information, product details, price lists, and other relevant data using the web app. A salesperson can then use the mobile app to create and send invoices on the go using the information in the database. The same salesperson can then go back to their desk and use the web app to analyze large volumes of data, such as the company’s sales for the quarter, and run reports in order to see how the business is doing. 
 Such integration is particularly helpful for businesses that have to manage inventory, such as food and beverage firms or retail establishments. 
 Barcodes are another use case. In order to receive information about their inventory, companies often need to upload large amounts of data around their products to the database, which is where the desktop platform comes in useful. 
 However, to use barcodes effectively, firms must invest in equipment like barcode scanners. With Deskera’s mobile app, though, scanning barcodes using the phone’s camera is intuitive, allowing workers to scan products and carry out transactions in-store without needing any additional equipment. 
 Integration between the mobile and web apps enables employees to adapt the software to suit their needs, providing greater flexibility and choice in how they work. 
 The future of SaaS 
 In the future, Saurabh predicts that integration between mobile and web apps will feature as a dominant part of the SaaS landscape. 
 Ultimately, what SaaS companies need to focus on is creating the best user experience for their customers and continuing to provide them options that meet their needs. 
 “User experience is what makes or breaks a SaaS product,” he says. 
 
 Deskera is a cloud-based business software provider that enables businesses to run their operations more efficiently. Its mobile app has had 300,000 downloads since its launch in early 2020.

 Hello readers, 
 If I told you that you could buy anything from a latte to an airline ticket using your digital money of any form — be it bitcoin, GrabRewards, or airline miles — would it sound far-fetched? 
 That’s the future that  Synqa  is preparing itself for. Scroll down for a quick summary. 
  But first, your quick bytes for today:    
 1️⃣ GoViet is now Gojek Vietnam 
  Gojek and GoViet  have united to bring more motorbike-hailing services and feature upgrades to the customers in the country. 
 2️⃣ A US$10 billion game-streaming giant 
 A merger between China’s biggest game-streaming platforms, Huya and DouYu,  is brewing , and Tencent, which owns significant shares in both firms, is all up for it. If the deal pushes through, we will be looking at an online giant with more than 300 million users and a combined market value of US$10 billion. China is the world’s largest gaming market by revenue, and its  mobile gaming market  in particular is huge. 
 But Tencent is not only into game-streaming; it is also expanding the presence of its streaming platform, WeTV, in Southeast Asia. Just two months ago, the titan  acquired Iflix , a regional player with a sizable user base. And don’t forget about livestreaming ecommerce: The space is  gaining traction, too . 
 3️⃣ TikTok’s estimated price: US$30 billion 
 Not one to slow down, Microsoft plans to finish its  acquisition talks  with TikTok in the US before September 15 – a deadline set by President Donald Trump – with a price tag of up to US$30 billion for the short-video app. 
 4️⃣ Facebook launches TikTok-like product 
 Instagram  has just launched Reels , a feature in the app that lets users make short entertaining videos, in countries like the US, Japan, Australia, India, and more. This year, the social media giant has also been busy investing in Asia with its recent deal in  Reliance  and  Gojek . 
 5️⃣ India banned more Chinese apps 
 The list of banned apps in India just keeps  getting longer . The latest 15 include ByteDance-owned video editing app CapCut and Xiaomi’s browser app. 
 6️⃣ Delivery Hero to go up against Uber Eats 
 German online food delivery group Delivery Hero is heading into Japan and has plans to  face Uber Eats  head on. “We will properly challenge Uber Eats. We will start with 10,000 restaurants,” said its chief executive. Delivery Hero is present in over 40 countries and  claims to be  the largest food delivery company outside of China. 
 
 The company that wants to make it easier to transact using digital values of any form 
   
Raise your hand if you hold digital values like ether or any loyalty points and rewards like airline miles. Then there’s good news for you:  Synqa  is looking to make it easier for you to use them across e-wallets and other payment modes. 
 
 
 Money however you like : Synqa’s goal is to build a blockchain network that will facilitate transactions of any type of digital value, whether between cryptocurrencies, fiat money, or loyalty points. With this capability, you could use your Starbucks rewards points to pay for a ride on Grab, for instance. 
 
 It has already gotten some interest  from high-profile names like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The company has also raised over  US$125 million to date, including US$25 million through an initial coin offering. 
 
 Merchants as backing : Omise – Synqa’s payment gateway business – has  40,000 enterprise clients,  including some big names like McDonald’s and Thai telco True Corporation. This could mean faster adoption when the network is released if all of them are onboarded onto the network. 
 
 A difficult birth : There have been repeated launch delays and ambiguous deadlines due to tech issues and tough competition. While  it was finally released in June, there seems to have  been little traction so far.

653958,GoPay becomes a payment option on YouTube in Indonesia," GoPay, Gojek’s digital wallet and payment solutions platform, today announced that it is now available as a payment option for YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions in Indonesia. 
 It claims it’s the first e-wallet to be available as a payment method on YouTube in the archipelago.

 The announcement signifies an extension of GoPay’s  existing partnership  with Google Play, which started last year. The collaboration has enabled consumers in Indonesia to buy games on the app store and make in-app purchases via GoPay, the first e-wallet to be available on Google Play in Indonesia, GoPay claimed. 
 The tie-up materialized after Gojek  received more investment  from Google, along with Facebook, PayPal, and Tencent, to boost digital financial services in Asia. 
 “We are excited to offer GoPay as a new payment option on YouTube – a collaboration that is particularly timely as more people stay at home and seek out various forms of entertainment,” Timothius Martin, GoPay’s senior vice president of product marketing, said in a statement. He added that the Google-owned video app is one of the most accessed platforms in Indonesia during the pandemic, based on industry data. 
 According to JPMorgan,  card penetration  is very low in Indonesia, with just 0.59 debit cards per capita and 0.07 credit cards per capita. 
 GoPay aims to continue to widen consumers’ access to payment options, according to the statement. As of March 2019, the digital payments platform claims it has about  115 million users , based on Gojek application downloads.

653997,"Indonesian debt management app Credibook raises seed money from Insignia, Payfazz","  Credibook , an Indonesian digital debt management startup, said it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding in a round led by Insignia Ventures Partners and agent-based financial app Payfazz. 
 Launched in February 2020, Credibook wants to make debt management easier for small and medium-sized enterprises. In its app, merchants can record their customers’ debt and remind them to pay when the due date has passed. The startup recently launched payment features so customers can also pay their debt using the app. 
 Credibook will use the new funds for product development and user acquisition.

 “I got the idea from seeing many small stalls or  warung  who still record their customers’ debt with pen and paper,” Credibook chief executive Gabriel Frans told  Tech in Asia . 
 
 
 
 
 Payfazz chief executive Hendra Kwik said that helping to develop Credibook is aligned with his vision of building the “Google Play of fintech apps” for rural Indonesia. “We learned from our network of agents and  warungs  that informal credit is common among distributors, wholesalers, small businesses, and the unbanked.” 
 
 
 
 
  How much traction has it gotten?  The company claims that it currently has more than 200,000 users from various sectors, such as  warungs , laundry stores, fashion stores, construction materials shops, and automotive workshops. 
 It acquires users through a top-down approach, tapping into communities and distribution networks. Even though Credibook has a strategic partnership with Payfazz, Frans emphasized that his app’s users are different from the agency-based platform’s. 
 “We are barely starting to integrate with Payfazz,” he said. However, he didn’t deny that there is a possibility that Credibook will also tap into Payfazz’s agents. 
 The firm also claims that it has recorded US$350 million worth of customers’ debt, as Credibook tapped not only into the business-to-consumer market, but also into the business-to-business market, Frans said. 
 “For example, we also recorded merchants’ debt to their wholesalers. That’s why we can have a huge gross debt value,” he explained. 
  What are its future plans?  Frans realized that similar apps like BukuWarung and BukuKas have also acquired hundreds of thousands of users. 
 However, according to him, the game is not about the number of users acquired, but how to monetize them. This is why the five-month-old startup quickly launched payment features through its partnership with Payfazz. 
 In the near future, Credibook also plans to launch a lending feature through a partnership with Modal Rakyat, Payfazz’s lending partner. The startup said it’s still improving the feature’s user journey and experience, but has already attracted some interest for the new service. 
 “Time to market is essential, so we have to leverage the momentum,” Frans said.

  Who are the team members?  Before building Credibook, Frans was a former expansion product manager at Traveloka. He was also an associate product manager at Kudo, where he met Payfazz’s Kwik. 
 Credibook co-founders Christian Lie and Dekha Anggareska, meanwhile, were formerly head of regional sales at Payfazz and co-founder of retail software Rulo, respectively. 
 “My experience at Kudo and Chris’ at Payfazz [both agent-based startups] helps us to understand this very local segment and build Credibook,” Frans said. 
 Credibook currently has 14 employees, with half of them responsible for product development. ",Aditya Hadi Pratama,0,3,"[(3, 0.99975795)]","['Payfazz', 'Credibook']","['Asia', 'Indonesia']"

653696,Safe data use: Striking a balance between insight and privacy," As companies begin to look toward the future of their businesses, data has become one of the most valuable assets. It is powering not just the strategies and decisions of existing companies but also the emergence of entirely new economies and markets that had not previously existed. 
 More companies are starting to take advantage of data-driven insights in order to get a leg up on the competition. An  April 2019 survey by Deloitte  highlighted the fact that companies with strong analytics cultures “significantly exceeded their business goals in the past 12 months.” This is because in using data, companies are gaining good information to enrich their products and services. This further reinforced a  2017 Aberdeen  survey, which noted that companies leveraging on data to drive strategy and development see a marked 45% decrease in time spent bringing a product to market. 
 Data and privacy take center stage 
 Unfortunately, the prevalence of data is also creating privacy problems as legislation to govern its responsible use can’t keep up with the amount of data generated. This has led to a rise in major data breaches, such as the infamous  2017 Equifax scandal, which resulted in the exposure of 147.9 million consumers’ credit information . 
 Companies are now more aware of privacy issues and  are responding to breaches with cybersecurity measures , but cyber vulnerability remains a threat. According to Noam Dror, vice president of worldwide privacy engineering at data privacy firm  Privitar , a significant area of exposure for companies is the growing number of partnerships with third parties such as mobile marketing or CRM solutions providers. These outside consultants provide valuable support to businesses but they are also potential “backdoors” that expose companies indirectly. 
 
   Noam Dror, vice president of worldwide privacy engineering at Privitar / Photo credit: Privitar  
 
 Accenture’s  State of Cyber Resilience Report 2020  points out that hackers and malicious actors are taking increasingly sophisticated angles of attack: 40% of cyberattacks have shifted downstream to the aforementioned third parties. 
 This was the case with one of the largest data breaches of 2019. Game developer Zynga, which put out games playable on and integrated with Facebook,  was hacked last year, leading to the leakage of 170 million users’ passwords . Hackers didn’t need to go after Facebook itself; instead, they exploited the vulnerabilities of the platform’s ecosystem. 
 “There’s no absolute security” 
 As our daily lives become increasingly oriented around digital services and social media platforms, it’s also becoming increasingly clear how impossible it is to totally eliminate all privacy and security risks. “There’s no absolute security,” confirms Privitar’s Dror. “We [can] put locks on all our houses, but we’ll still get break-ins.” Today’s digital natives need to give up on the idea of absolute security and instead embrace data-centric techniques that assume a zero-trust environment. 
 He provides an example of privacy risk: combining publicly available Covid-19 data with easily accessible social media information to re-identify infected individuals. The combined data creates a  “linkage attack”  situation where multiple sources of information are combined to “re-identify” otherwise anonymized data. The repercussions of such an incident could not only endanger the exposed individuals but also pose  serious legal liabilities  to the firms handling the data. 
 Additionally, there is a cooling effect such cases have on the willingness of companies to pursue technological breakthroughs. Innovation happens when disparate pieces of data are brought together to form new insights. But if companies are wary of inadvertently breaking the law, they could start backing off from these innovative ideas, perhaps even abandoning them altogether. 
 “It stops everyone from going down the path of doing innovative work,” Dror says. 
 A vision for the future of data privacy 
 According to Dror, the problem isn’t necessarily the amount of personal data floating around, but rather how visible the data makes individuals. Privitar’s Data Privacy Platform aims to reduce, as much as possible, the potential for datasets to be used to re-identify people. 
 One such tool in the platform’s arsenal automatically adjusts the “resolution” of the data. For instance, in the issue of Covid-19 patient information, the data included specific details such as age, gender, area of residence, and workplace. By replacing these data points with more generalized information, it’s become harder for data to be used for re-identification. 
 Another method is the application of “watermarks” in specific datasets for specific use cases. Watermarks containing recipient and use case information are embedded within the datasets and are traceable across thumb drives, emails, and formats. 
 The watermarks provide “proof that this data belongs to you,” says Dror. “This will control the behavior of people [and make them] respect the use of data and make sure it’s safe.” 
 
   Photo credit: Privitar  
 
 This particular technique was especially relevant for one of Privitar’s major clients, National Health Service Digital. The national information and technology partner to the United Kingdom’s health and social care system wanted to take advantage of its large volume of patient data to provide better medical services by working with third parties with machine learning and analytics technologies. However, regulators flagged major privacy breach issues with this open sharing of patient information. 
 NHS Digital engaged Privitar’s services to create a centralized solution to de-identify patient records, and watermarks embedded in datasets make them safe to disseminate to trusted third party research environments. 
 The digital privacy industry is seeing its relevance grow as the volume of highly sensitive data rises. The coronavirus pandemic has made healthcare information more crucial and more exposed than before. Healthcare-related data breaches are on the rise as cybercriminals take advantage of the situation to exploit privacy vulnerabilities. 
 Dror noted that companies are also accelerating their digital transformation, which raises the need for more robust data collection and management services. “We have customers coming to us asking for more help as they have more highly sensitive data to incorporate,” he says. 
 Shaping the future of data privacy 
 The coronavirus pandemic has helped data privacy firms by centering the conversation around how companies must rise to meet the challenges posed by a data-driven digital future. “Data and privacy are going to become increasingly mainstream ideas,” says Dror. “Companies need to demonstrate to the market that privacy is going to be mainstream. We see it as the new norm for large organizations to take this seriously.” 
 Companies will have to walk a fine line between balancing security concerns and optimizing the benefits of data in order to find solutions to difficult questions that have few straight answers. There are exciting debates taking place across the industry about the state of our private lives amidst a digital reality, and the outcomes will become particularly significant to both organizations and individuals in the near future.

653882,Making sense of the senseless layoffs in tech," 
   Photo by  Avery Evans  on  Unsplash   
 
 When business realities hit the tech community and faith in the ecosystem erodes, we ought to do some soul searching. In the first half of this year, we saw numerous layoffs and complaints from employees in the tech space. It’s sad, but at the same time, it’s often nothing personal; it’s just the real business world at work. 
 In a previous piece, I argued that there are  no perfect layoffs . Back then, I said that Airbnb was the gold standard when it comes to executing staff cuts. However, while its external communications was applauded, this piece from the  New York Times   suggests  that the company’s kumbaya ideals have come under strain. 
 According to an ex-Airbnb employee, “there are a lot of people who feel very betrayed” by the layoffs. It’s natural to feel this way. 
 If you are reading this and got laid off or have executed staff cuts recently, I feel for you. The goal of this piece isn’t to rub salt on the wound. Rather, I believe the tech community should think deeper about why these things have happened and what lessons we can draw from them. 
 I believe it’s critical that founders or employees go into the tech and startup arena with eyes wide open. To do that, we must dissect the different types of startups in the ecosystem: 
   
 Food for thought for founders 
 Raising money is just one of the vehicles to help you reach your goal. But fundraising comes with a lot of pressure and responsibilities, coupled with losing some control of your company. Ask yourself if this is the life you want because you are going to be spending a lot of time in your company. And remember that life is a lot more than just building startups and creating wealth. 
 Alternatively, if you want to take your time to build things and still be in control, either bootstrap or raise from like-minded investors who will let you exercise your judgement (i.e., grid C). Your immediate goal should be to reach product-market fit and profitability as soon as possible. 
 While ambitious founders typically want to reach grid D, getting from C to D will take a long time. It’s actually much faster to get from B to D, but it can be painful when fast-growing companies face market realities. For instance, removing discounts dampens demand and cutting manpower in turn reduces morale. Growing at a breakneck pace often means internal culture and processes are compromised. 
 Another truth is that few companies get to grid D. Firms in this category are typically some kind of platform that benefit from massive scale – to the detriment of their competitors. The battle at the top is often also a winner-takes-all match that results in monopolies or oligopolies. 
 Founders therefore need a plan in case they run out of venture capital money and can no longer raise funds before they get there. Do they sell the company? Do they pivot to grid C? If that happens, is the  founder still the best person  to lead or is it time to bring in someone new? 
 A prominent global investor once told me that there is no shame in taking time to build a company. He shared that a friend took 20 years to hit US$20 million in annual revenue for his company that was valued at US$200 million. It took a while, and the firm isn’t a “unicorn,” but he is an extremely happy founder. 
 Food for thought for employees 
 It’s beneficial to understand which grid the company you are joining belongs to. If you want stability and good perks, join companies in D. However, it will be extra painful when these firms suddenly go downhill (i.e., Airbnb, Wirecard). 
 If you want excitement and have some tolerance for risk, go to startups in B. You have to understand though that you are giving up stability (i.e., WeWork, Oyo, Luckin Coffee). Expect personnel and strategic plans to change rapidly and often as well. 
 C-type companies – like  Tech in Asia  – have a balance of excitement and stability but aren’t for those who prefer to go big or go home. 
 When the shit hits the fan in the future, I hope we can navigate the ups and downs with more perspective. It’s OK to feel jaded as an employee, but remember that very few people predicted that startups or even entire industries would suddenly jump from B, C, or D to A in a matter of weeks. A lot of founders are dealing with this situation for the first time, so mistakes are bound to be made. 
 After all, a kumbaya work culture is great, but it has to be balanced with business performance and needs. 
 As Netflix CEO Reed Hastings  said , “We model ourselves on being a team, not a family.” A business is more similar to a professional sports team. It shares the bond and camaraderie, but ultimately, performance matters. 
 Still growing at all costs? 
 What’s a good or bad decision depends on market sentiment, too. 
 When investors in tech have an appetite for growth, they tell founders to grow at all costs. Prior to WeWork’s  downfall , profitability was greeted with a “meh,” and founders were looked down upon when their companies weren’t growing as fast – even if they achieved profitability. 
 When the economy tanked, investors started pivoting their advice: “If you aren’t profitable – which many of you are not – cut your costs fast and cut deep. Don’t die by a thousand cuts.” It’s the right advice for this moment, and founders need to hear it. That’s why these cuts, when they happened, seemed sudden. 
 The reality is that a majority of venture-backed tech startups are built for user growth, not profitability. This mentality is fine when funding is freely available, so when investors pull the capital plug, it makes founders nervous. After spending significant efforts in setting up for growth, founders now have to tear it all down and rebuild for survival, and that naturally results in layoffs. 
 Leflair, a Vietnam-based ecommerce startup, went through this painful path and  didn’t survive  despite raising a US$7 million series B round in January 2019 and seeing its revenue grow consecutively at 100% over the last four years. 
 Some would think that it shouldn’t have been too challenging for Leflair to raise additional capital – particularly with its hockey stick revenue growth. But they would be wrong. The company hit roadblocks when fundraising, even with its existing investors. 
 The firm’s CEO, Loïc Gautier, previously told  Tech in Asia  that by December last year, investors had begun saying, “We really like Leflair, but if it’s not profitable, it’s going to be very difficult to convince our limited partners. We have to pull out.” 
 Despite exhibiting fast growth, none of the firm’s existing shareholders put in money. Leflair did a series of layoffs, exhausted all options, and eventually filed for  bankruptcy in May 2020 . 
 This raises some questions: Did the shareholders stop Leflair from growing at all costs? Is there more to the situation than meets the eye? Is the growth-at-all-costs mindset worth it? 
 The lean and mean era

 The tech scene was already starting to feel jaded from growing at all costs. The pandemic only sped things up and got all of us to reflect deeper. 
 The good news is that the tech community seems to be waking up from its growth fatigue, and  hitting profitability is now the new cool. Investors are coming up with new terms such as “ rhino ” to replace the mythical “unicorn.” And well-funded or even profitable companies are restructuring and optimizing to stay as lean and mean as possible as well. 
 Even leaders in tech are changing their tune. Gojek co-CEO Andre Soelistyo, for one, wrote in his  layoff address  that the team “had previously optimized the company for growth and impact.” 
 “[…] We imagined, naively, that the rate of growth would always accelerate. We didn’t plan enough for the inevitable downturn and we are paying for that now,” he wrote, though he doesn’t regret the move. 
 Even in the Valley, sentiments are changing. At Reid Hoffman’s  Masters of Scale  podcast, Tony Tjan of VC firm Cue Ball Group described the growth-at-all-cost mentality as “short term-ism:” 
 
 
   “The greatest concern in our capital markets right now is short term-ism. Short term-ism is causing great, great risk to the capital markets, and it is not allowing great quality to grow. We’re in a period of microwave capitalism, and most things that come out of the microwave don’t taste very good.  
    We have to go back to recognizing that companies and capitalism have a purpose much more than just capturing value. They are out there to do more than just making profit. Ironically, even if that was your objective, which was just to make as much money as possible, the way to do it is to focus on what will create durable cultures. That’s the only long-term competitive advantage.” 
 
 
 I agree with Tjan and encourage founders to  build companies that last . But there’s nothing wrong with founders who want to grow their startups into giants very quickly. Most investors  like to fund  the founders of those companies, so it’s a match. Unfortunately, this may also push a small group of founders to  fabricate growth . 
 Whatever you choose to do, just remember to go into the startup arena with your eyes wide open. ",Willis Wee,0,7,"[(1, 0.51892626), (2, 0.09158328), (3, 0.38183194)]","['Leflair', 'WeWork']","['Airbnb', 'VC', 'Asia', 'Wirecard', 'Valley', 'Vietnam']"
653872,Salary vs ESOP?,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Hello readers, 
 Does this sound familiar? A startup employee cashed out their shares in the company and became an overnight millionaire. 
 But while tech companies are known for including stock options in salary packages, not everyone gets the same fairytale ending. 
 In reality, many founders and employees in Indonesia are still figuring out how employee stock option plans work. Find out more in  this article  or scroll down for a short summary. 
  But first, your quick bytes for today:    
1️⃣ After taking a quick personal break, Ajey Gore, the former CTO of Gojek, is back — not at the ride-hailing startup but at Sequoia Capital India, with the title of  operating partner  of technology. 
 2️⃣ “If only we can invest as much as we spend…” Good news: Grab heard you. The Southeast Asian giant’s fintech arm has launched its first micro-investment solution  AutoInvest  along with other products, including consumer loans through a third-party platform. 
 3️⃣ In continuation of the “Microsoft is  maybe buying  TikTok” story, we’re finally hearing from China, and the middle kingdom is  not happy about it , saying that they have “plenty of ways to respond if the [US] administration carries out its planned smash and grab.” 
 4️⃣ Want to get on board Ant Group’s upcoming stock sale that could surpass oil giant Saudi Aramco’s US$29.4 billion IPO? Then you better  not be working  with its rivals, as advised by senior executives at Alibaba, which owns a third of the Ant Group. 
 5️⃣ China’s ride-hailing giant DiDi Chuxing is preparing to expand to Russia, but experts are  saying  it’s not going to be easy — Uber had tried and failed in 2017. 
 6️⃣ While Indian drivers have been seeing a decline in ride-hailing demand on Uber and Ola, they have also spotted  another opportunity : Listing their vehicles on online travel aggregators such as Goibibo, MakeMyTrip, and Meru, because there is still a demand for intercity rides. 
 
 Would you like some stock options on top of your salary? 
   
To tech workers, cashing out their employee stock option plan (ESOP) sounds like a dream. But for many in Indonesia, they’re scratching their heads trying to understand  how ESOP works . 
 
 
 Cash is still king : Most Indonesian tech workers still prefer the instant benefit of receiving higher salaries. In addition, the shares are basically invisible money — employees don’t see their value until there is an IPO or M&amp;A. 
 
 However,  a Tweet from a former employee of both Shopee and Lazada stated that “in other countries, most startup employees became rich because of ESOP, not salary.”  
 
 No exits needed : Some startups have realized the difficulties in cashing out for their ESOP holders — what with laws, stock exchanges, taxes, and more — so they created a buyback share program in order for employees to taste the fruits of their labor. 
 
 Dive deeper:  Does Indonesia lack an ESOP culture?

 Starting today, customers in the country will be able to access motorbike-hailing services through GoBike, logistics services with GoSend, and food delivery via GoFood all from within the Gojek app. 
 The unified service now gives consumers in Vietnam access to Gojek’s over 150,000 drivers and 80,000 food merchants in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, according to a statement. 
 In addition, the company also introduced several feature upgrades, including a simpler home screen, an option for users to pin favorite dishes within GoFood, image sharing between customers and drivers, and support for multiple orders across services. 
 “Today marks a significant moment in Gojek’s journey, and in our long-term commitment to Vietnam,” said Gojek co-CEOs Kevin Aluwi and Andre Soelistyo. “We continue to see immense potential for growth and impact in the country, and we’re proud and excited to introduce the Gojek super app experience to an existing and new generation of users.” 
 The ride-hailing major also said that its users can now also access the Gojek app in all countries where it operates, including Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore. The app will also be available in Thailand within the coming weeks, Gojek said. 
 Last month, GoViet announced it would merge the brand with its parent firm Gojek and rebrand the service as Gojek Vietnam. 
 “This has been in the making for many months. We started on the strategy to upgrade, to get to scale more efficiently, better serve the customers in these markets, since well into mid-last year,” Gojek’s head of international Andrew Lee told  Nikkei Asian Review . 
 The same changes are also coming to Get, Gojek’s Thailand unit, according to the report. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.9995887)]","['app', 'Gojek', 'GoSend', 'GoViet', 'GoFood']","['Singapore', 'Hanoi', 'Vietnam', 'GoBike', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia']"
653817,Demystifying Omise parent Synqa’s plans to disrupt payment networks," Imagine being able to pay for a cup of coffee at a Starbucks outlet in Singapore as well as a taxi ride in Japan using any digital value in your possession – be it bitcoin, GrabRewards, or airline miles. That’s the future  Synqa  (formerly called Omise Holdings) group CEO and founder Jun Hasegawa envisions. 
 “Since [loyalty points] have a value, you can tokenize them on the blockchain. We can make them interoperable,” he tells  Tech in Asia .

 To get there, Synqa appears to have a two-pronged approach. Firstly, to acquire merchant customers through Omise, its payment gateway business, though this isn’t game-changing in itself. Stripe, Adyen, 2C2P, and Red Dot Payment are some of its competitors. 
 Secondly, to develop OMG Network (formerly OmiseGo), its blockchain technology that’s meant to disrupt the Visa/MasterCard regime dominating the payments space. 
 The last step would be marrying the two together and cutting traditional payment networks out of the equation. This means migrating Omise onto the OMG Network and onboarding tens of thousands of merchants onto the platform in the process. Making the marriage work and bringing merchants and users onboard at scale will be a big test. 
 “We’re two separate companies under the same group. We would provide our services to Omise Payments just like we would if they were an OMG Network customer. Omise Payments’ merchants are Omise Payments’ merchants,” Vansa Chatikavanij, CEO of OMG Network,  said in July . 
 Omise, the payment gateway 
 Similar to the US-based payment processing company Stripe, Omise helps enterprises reduce friction for customers during the checkout process by providing a range of digital payment methods. For Omise, these include payments via credit and debit cards, e-wallets TrueMoney and AliPay, and national funds transfer services PromptPay and PayNow. 
 It counts Thailand, Japan, and Singapore as its main markets. Some of its big-name clients in Thailand include McDonald’s, King Power, budget carrier Nox Air, and telco True Corporation. The bulk of its volume comes from business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions for small and medium-sized enterprises – which make up 95% of its client pool – though it also processes business-to-business (B2B) transactions. 
 Hasegawa reveals that Omise has made over 60 million transactions since its inception. That number is expected to hit 100 million by the end of this year.

 Omise, which was set up in 2015, isn’t profitable yet. According to public filings with Thailand’s Digital Government Development Agency (DGDA), Synqa’s entity in Thailand lost 115.9 million baht (US$3.7 million), decreasing by 14% from the year before, while revenue was at 549.5 million baht (US$17.4 million). 
 “The Thai entity is a development and operations center for all Omise (payment) subsidiaries. Investments on R&amp;D and market are made from Thailand,” Hasegawa says, regarding the figures. 
 Omise’s Thailand business is also bumping heads with payment processing company  2C2P , which counts tech giants Apple, Facebook and ecommerce platform Lazada among its clients. Comparatively,  2C2P was profitable  last year, generating US$81.3 million in revenue. 
 On top of handling transactions, 2C2P also helps its clients with B2B flows between suppliers, founder and group CEO Aung Kyaw Moe told  Tech in Asia  in an interview  last year . These enterprise-to-enterprise transactions drive additional – and possibly significant – revenue for any payment gateway company. 
 Tapping the SME market 
 One of Omise’s key selling points is its fast integration speeds. “For merchants, it’s easier to integrate with us compared to other payment gateways,” Hasegawa says. 
 An executive from a competing platform, who spoke to  Tech in Asia  on the condition of anonymity, says that Synqa – via Omise – is able to do this by riding on Visa’s  CyberSource  payment processing technology. 
 According to the source, such reliance on third-party technology poses limitations. While working with CyberSouce could give Omise access to Visa’s network of global  acquirers and issuers , it doesn’t work for merchants and financial institutions that are not part of the CyberSource network. 
 Hasegawa could not confirm if Omise uses CyberSource. “Omise works directly with Visa and Mastercard and their partners in a number of ways to create our services,” he added. 
 Payment gateways that rely on third-party technology can also be restricted in the number of services they can offer clients, which could be a disadvantage when they serve enterprises that value customized support or features over ease of integration. 
 “Enabling payments – approving the transaction after customers key in their payment details – is just 5% to 10% of what a payment gateway company does,” says the source. The rest of it involves cross-border settlement processing and enterprise resource planning (ERP) integration, as well as handling tax and supplier payments, he adds. 
 There are also high costs incurred from leasing third-party technology, compared to using an in-house developed solution. According to DGDA filings, Omise’s total expenditure was 665.3 million baht (US$21 million) in 2019, up 56% from the year before. 
 Omise did not comment on what contributed to the high costs last year but says the figures of its Thai business isn’t necessarily reflective of its spending since it includes factors such as devaluation of assets and restructuring. 
 It’s possible that OMG Network will eventually help Omise wean off its reliance on third-party technologies. Hasegawa says that within the next 12 to 18 months, OMG Network will power transactions that take place via Omise. 
 OMG, seamless transactions? 
  OMG Network  has held much promise since the beginning, appearing to have drawn support from high-profile names like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon, co-author of the  Lightning Network , and the  Central Bank of Thailand . 
 In 2017, Synqa raised  US$25 million  through an initial coin offering to fund the project. It recently  bagged US$80 million  in series C funding, led by Siam Commercial Bank’s corporate venture arm SCB 10X.

 Much like the internet that powers web services, OMG Network is the underlying infrastructure intended for a new generation of financial products and services. The network is designed to be interoperable, allowing any e-wallet, merchant, or tech provider to transact digital values of any form once they’re plugged in. 
 If successful, the platform has the potential to leapfrog international payment giants like Visa and Mastercard, which currently command the lion’s share of revenue in the international payments market, through decentralized models that eliminate the need for multiple and costly financial intermediaries. 
 Ethereum has been talking about scaling for years, but there’s been no progress 
 The network can facilitate the transfer of digital value across e-wallets and payment types, and overcome the speed and cost limitations of the Ethereum network through its unique scaling solution – the only offering of this nature on the market, the company claims. So far, Ethereum’s slow processing bandwidth has prohibited large-scale adoption. 
 “Ethereum has been talking about scaling for years, but there’s been no progress and gas fees are sky high,” says En Hui Ong, who used to head business development at blockchain platform Zilliqa. 
 OMG Network’s  layer-2 solution , called the Plasma, overcomes Ethereum’s limitation by allowing a bulk of transaction operations to be handled on the “child chain” – in this case, OMG Network – before they are sent in batches to the “parent” Ethereum chain for final verification. It can be thought of as a carpooling of transactions that serves to reduce traffic on the information “highway,” thus increasing speeds and reducing costs per “passenger.” 
 As a result, compared to Ethereum, which can process around 15 transactions per second, OMG Network is able to process thousands of transactions simultaneously – on par with the speed of credit card transactions – with fees that are one-third cheaper than those on an average transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, Hasegawa claims. 
 “There are few other [layer-2] solutions that allow people to transfer ETH and ERC20 with a very high throughput: thousands of transactions per second (TPS). However, I’m confident that we are the most professional blockchain company in the industry. I don’t see much competition yet,” he says.

 OMG Network currently supports its own e-wallet, allowing peer-to-peer transfers of the OMG token, Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT), though the product is still being beta-tested. Hasegawa himself admits that there are limited use cases and users for now. “We haven’t officially launched yet,” he notes. 
 To be sure, OMG Network  isn’t the only layer-2 solution  out there. That said, it’s unique in that it also owns a payment gateway with 40,000 enterprise clients, which could translate to faster blockchain adoption down the line. 
 A rough start 
 The blockchain network, however, has had a difficult birth. Plagued by repeated  launch delays  and ambiguous deadlines, the OMG Network  launched commercially  in June, more than three years after it was introduced with much fanfare in February 2017. 
 Working with a new technology and building a solution that didn’t exist before have also posed their fair share of challenges, leading to launch delays. “Building the OMG Network is an iterative process,” Hasegawa explains. 
 Go Exchange, a cryptocurrency platform meant to facilitate the transfer of digital assets, would have contributed towards Synqa’s broader vision of building decentralized financial services, but it was  shut down  within a year and a half of operations. The company has cited regulatory hurdles as a chief reason for the closure. 
 At nearly three months old, there’s little traction on the blockchain network so far, though it’s currently in talks with enterprises and potential network partners to test transactions. “We also have exchanges [regarding] integration with our network and we expect the number of transactions to increase exponentially after the integration is finished,” Hasegawa adds. 
 He says a recent  partnership with Tether (USDT) , which allows for deposits and withdrawals of the stablecoin via the OMG Network, is significant because of the substantial volume of people conducting stablecoin transactions. An estimated  US$212 billion  worth of value was transferred or settled via Tether in 2019. 
 Synqa has also inked a partnership with Toyota Financial Services (TFS), an investor in Synqa’s series C fundraise, to expand the  Toyota Wallet . The digital money app is part of the car manufacturer’s efforts to transform into a mobility company. It aims to see customers through the entire value chain, from car sales and car rentals to insurance, vehicle servicing, and more. 
 To that end, the Toyota Wallet will eventually incorporate payment functions as well as a potential customer loyalty function, although Synqa’s level of involvement is unclear. 
 “The Toyota Wallet project’s developments and requirements depend on each country. It’s thus hard to tell how exactly we support TFS in the development of the Toyota Wallet,” says Hasegawa, adding that details are still being discussed. 
 Lack of updates on past partnerships 
 Synqa has said that the newly raised US$80 million will be used to add more features to make its tech stack more attractive to merchants. However, scant details on its partnerships with large multinationals offer little comfort to OMG token holders. 
 “Our investors for series C are all very strategic. In the next 6 to 12 months, you will see more collaborations and deeper engagement with our new investors,” Hasegawa says. 
 Synqa has a history of involving high-profile stakeholders. In 2018, it signed a  memorandum of understanding with Shinhan Card , an affiliate of South Korea’s Shinhan Financial Group, to test the latter’s loyalty and rewards program using OMG Network’s technology. Another pilot with  Citibank Thailand  trialed the use of Citi Rewards Points for digital payments. The partnership with Shinhan Card has since ceased, while Citi’s “pay with points” feature is still available in Thailand. 
 Synqa also continues to work with “different financial institutions in Thailand,” Hasegawa says. 
 Hype around OMG tokens and Ethereum has waned since the cryptocurrency boom of 2018. At US$1.85 as of August 3, the price of the OMG token is now a fraction of what it was in its height – over US$28 – in January 2018. 
   
 But Hasegawa says he’s not bothered by fluctuations in value and interest. “The OMG token is purely a utility token, meant for staking and participating in the ecosystem. It’s not intended to be a financial asset.” 
 The tokens are supposed to allow holders to participate in the transaction validation process and earn revenues as a result. Up until then, investors can only wait. 
 Has the ship sailed? 
 Synqa is in a race against time, particularly as competing solutions launch in the market. 
 Fiat currency-to-cryptocurrency transactions already exist today. Blockchain payment processing companies like  BitPay  offer an existing digital asset management solution that enables users to turn digital assets into dollars after spending at tens of thousands of businesses through the e-wallet or a prepaid Visa card. 
 A recent move by Mastercard to grant principal membership to  Wirex  will allow the UK-based digital payment platform to directly issue Mastercard-branded payment cards to users. Cardholders can, in turn, instantly convert their cryptocurrencies into traditional fiat currency and spend them wherever Mastercard is accepted globally. 
 While neither of these methods are truly interoperable across payment types or networks, both have real-use cases. More importantly, they are being used by customers today. 
 Synqa will also have to hustle as governments race to develop national blockchain networks, which might eliminate the need for third-party blockchain solutions altogether. The Bank of Thailand, for instance, has begun exploring the idea of a  wholesale central bank digital currency  that could facilitate domestic transfers of wholesale funds in future. 
 “The longer Synqa waits and the longer it cannot execute, the less likely that its idea can be truly realized,” says the industry source.

 Gore will work with its portfolio chief technology officers and chief product officers by providing insight and expertise in building and scaling engineering, data science, product, and design functions, Shailendra Singh, managing director at Sequoia Capital, wrote in a  post . 
 Sequoia India said the appointment would help the company expand its contributions in these areas, which were previously led by its director of technology Anandamoy ‘Roy’ Roychowdhary. Roychowdhary has transitioned into a full-time investment advisory role as a principal with the Surge team. 
 “Ajey, one of the most respected CTOs in Asia, is famously a commerce graduate and self-taught engineer,” Singh noted. “His transformational role at Gojek is widely known, but more importantly, his principles and philosophies for leading engineering and product teams are much admired.” 
 Gore  left Gojek  in June to “take a personal break” after five years working there. Prior to Gojek, Gore founded software startup CodeIgnition, which was then acquired by the ride-hailing giant. He also previously worked as the chief technology officer at Hoppr and head of technology of ThoughtWorks. 
 Meanwhile, Sequoia India also named Star India’s chief marketing officer Gayatri Vasudeva Yadav and Salesforce’s Shweta Rajpal Kohli as its chief marketing officer and head of public policy, respectively. 
 “At a time when technology is transforming the world and capital is abundant, the one thing that stands out for the very best startups or VC firms is the ability to attract and nurture extraordinary talent,” Singh wrote. 
 Sequoia has invested across the region for over 14 years. Its portfolio companies include ride-hailing giant Gojek, ecommerce platform Tokopedia, and hospitality firm Oyo, among others.

 The round was led by machine learning-focused VC firm Bulba Ventures, along with existing investors and serial entrepreneurs in the fields of pharmaceuticals, IT, and AI. Yury Melnichek, co-founder of Bulba Ventures, has joined Gero’s board of directors.

 The startup will use the new funds to further develop its AI platform for analyzing clinical and genetic data to identify treatments for chronic aging-related diseases, mental disorders, and other diseases. 
  What problem is it solving?  “Aging is the most important single risk factor behind the incidence of chronic diseases and death. […] We are ready to slow down – if not reverse – aging with experimental therapies,” Peter Fedichev, co-founder and CEO of Gero, told  Tech in Asia . 
 The company observed that as population growth slows down, the average lifespan increases. For example, there will only be 250 million people older than 65 by the end of the decade in China. Countries like Singapore, meanwhile, are not able to attract enough migrants to help offset the aging population. 
 Gero then wants to provide a medical solution to help extend healthspan as well as improve the overall well-being and productivity of its future customers. 
 It’s trying to do so by collecting medical and genetic data via a repository of biological samples and creating a database of blood samples collected throughout the last 15 years of patients’ lives. Its proprietary AI platform was able to determine a type of protein that could help with rejuvenation if blocked or removed. 
 Gero claims that subsequent experiments involving aged animals have demonstrated mortality delay and functional improvements. 
  What is the opportunity and what are the challenges?  According to the company, the US longevity market alone is expected to reach US$13.5 trillion by 2032. 
 “Even though the [total addressable market] seems infinite, in reality, the situation is somewhat less rosy,” Fedichev noted. “Biology is hard and aging is not a disease and hence, you cannot reasonably expect to get registration of drugs aimed specifically against aging in a general population.” 
 The chief exec also acknowledged that helping to extend human life with a drug isn’t so new. Alphabet’s Calico and pharmaceutical major Novartis have had similar initiatives. Other players also include Nasdaq-listed Unity Biotechnology and Alkahest. 
 But Gero plans to focus on clinical trials in vulnerable populations, such as cancer patients, who are experiencing symptoms of accelerated aging. With its anti-aging therapeutics, the company believes that it could help reduce adherence to chemotherapy and improve quality of life after treatment. 
 “Using cancer-supportive care as an entry point for anti-aging therapy should let us tap into a US$20-billion-a-year – and quickly growing – market and simplified regulatory procedures,” Fedichev said. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Gero’s experimental anti-aging drug is still in the research and development stage. It’s making money in the meantime by offering AI-based solutions such as biological age estimations from wearable sensors for health risk assessment. 
 Its AI platform is currently being used to develop new therapies, reposition existing drugs, forecast chronic toxicity, and support clinical decisions. The company is also helping to find therapies for treatment of Covid-19. 
 Gero said its customers currently include banks with corporate wellness needs, pension funds, and a university. 
  Who are the team members?  Fedichev built Gero with Maxim Kholin, the startup’s business development director. Fedichev is a scientist with a background in biophysics, bioinformatics, and condensed matter physics, while Kholin specializes in business development and intellectual property protection. The duo also co-founded a drug discovery firm called Quantum Pharmaceuticals. 
 Gero said its team consists of “a dozen” experts who work with academic groups in the field of aging. ",Doris Yu,0,3,"[(0, 0.0861909), (2, 0.014418744), (3, 0.89932173)]","['Nasdaq', 'AI']","['US', 'Singapore', 'AI', 'Asia', 'Calico', 'China']"

 A boon for consumers, a bane for telcos? 
   
Physical SIM cards, is this goodbye? Circles Life has launched a service that lets users activate their mobile plans using eSIMs — digital SIM cards that are fixed inside phones — in Singapore. Here’s why that’s  a big deal . 
 
 
 Three minutes : That’s how fast you can sign up and activate your phone plan with eSIMs. It also means you wouldn’t have to go out to do so, making customer onboarding easier and safer in a time of social distancing. 
 
 Two billion : The number of newly shipped smartphones that are expected to be eSIM-compatible by 2025 – that’s nearly all the smartphones in the world. 
 
 So why is there pushback from telcos?  With the flexibility of using eSIMs, it’s easier for consumers to switch from one telco to another, which isn’t good news for telcos when their game plan is to lock-in customers through contracts. 
 
 The wave of the future?  Life would be easier with eSIMs: Travel roaming could be activated simply by a tap on the phone instead of physically changing a SIM card, for instance. But there are also caveats: privacy, data extraction, and more.

653721,The path to growth for small businesses in the new normal," While companies around the world have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, small businesses have been  hit particularly hard . And things have been especially challenging in Asia, where small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) account for 90% of enterprises in the region. 
 Although governments have rolled out various fiscal and monetary stimulus packages to help SMBs navigate this tough period, businesses will need to adapt to the demands of the new normal in order to weather the storm and emerge stronger from the crisis. 
 Scrambling to adapt 
 “Covid-19 has exacerbated many of the challenges faced by smaller enterprises,” says Chris Yio, regional vice president of SMB in Asia for  Salesforce . 
 These companies often have much smaller customer bases than big corporations and don’t have as much cash in the bank. They’re also not the most tech-savvy – a report by Ernst &amp; Young in 2019 revealed that  54.9%  of SMBs surveyed in Southeast Asia were only in the early stages of digital innovation. 
 As a result, when cities went into lockdown earlier this year, working practices at these firms were disrupted significantly, leaving many scrambling to adapt the way they operated. 
 Companies that were reliant on physical interactions with customers rushed to adopt digital solutions in order to stay afloat, and smaller businesses lagged in productivity, as they didn’t have the infrastructure in place to support work–from-home setups. 
 Revenues were also affected: Lockdowns led to a decrease in demand for various services, and  61% of SMBs in East Asia and the Pacific  reportedly saw a significant decline in earnings as a result. 
 With that, cash, or the lack thereof, has become a major concern for SMBs, with 40% of smaller enterprises citing cash flow constraints as a challenge they have to grapple with. 
 All these issues have led to layoffs, pay cuts, and even business closures. In Singapore, for instance, about  3,800 businesses  have ceased operations since April this year. 
 And for surviving businesses, the road ahead will not be an easy one either. 
 Although economies are beginning to reopen, social distancing guidelines and  fears over new waves of infections  mean that SMBs are confronting a “new normal” that’s bringing on a  shift in customer demands . 
 Not only do these consumers now prefer to buy online and spend less time out and about, some are also tightening their purse strings because of the ongoing economic uncertainty. 
 The digital imperative

 According to Yio, Salesforce recommends tackling these challenges through a three-step process: stabilizing, reopening, and focusing on growth. 
 The first step is to stabilize the business by putting processes in place to address customer needs effectively in the new normal. This might mean reaching out proactively to top customers or setting up virtual contact centers and self-service portals to offer services at scale. 
 “Customer engagement through digital channels has become more important than ever,” says Yio. 
 Leaders will need to ensure that any changes come from the top and that they lead by example, setting clear directions to the team and guiding this shift to digital. 
 Outbound engagements are another way companies can build stability into their businesses. While customers might not be willing to buy their products now, it’s important for SMBs to connect with and reach out to their audience to assure them that the company will be available when they’re ready to make a purchase. 
 By using digital tools such as customer relationship management (CRM) platforms, SMBs can adapt the way they engage with customers at every stage of the customer lifecycle. 
 Such tools, like Salesforce’s Customer 360 platform, enable businesses to track data about their users, allowing them to understand and meet consumer needs effectively across every aspect of the business. 
 Case in point, when cities went into lockdown, dental cosmetics brand Zenyum was unable to book customers for offline consultations and treatments. Using the Salesforce CRM platform, the company  created a “Covid-19” tag  to monitor the customers whose experience of its product had been affected by restrictions. This allowed it to deliver comprehensive customer service and enabled its users to move onto the next step of treatment as quickly as possible when clinics reopened. 
 Such platforms will come in handy when businesses enter the reopening phase. Remote work is likely to remain the norm for the foreseeable future, and having a comprehensive CRM platform sets staff up to easily access information from a centralized cloud database, even while working from home. 
 And when businesses are ready to focus on growth, having access to a comprehensive CRM platform empowers employees and allows them to make data-driven decisions to deliver better service to customers. 
 As the pandemic shifts business processes, customers are likely receiving information across both physical and digital channels. Having one common platform as the key source of information helps employees give customers a coherent experience no matter where they’re interacting with the company. 
 But SMBs can go even further to figure out how to manage customer relationships and grow their businesses during this period. Salesforce has  rolled out several initiatives , such as its  Small Business Growth Kit  and on-demand webinars, to enable business leaders to learn more about effective CRM strategies amid the pandemic. 
 The small business path to growth 
 While SMBs may struggle to find their footing, Yio is confident that smaller enterprises will be able to adapt to the challenges of the new normal successfully. 
 Ultimately, these firms are more nimble than large corporations, so it’s easier for them to make changes, take action, and roll out new initiatives faster. 
 “Take advantage of this opportunity to change quickly and adapt to the new norm,” Yio advises. By being quick on their feet and ready to respond to customer demands, SMBs will be able to weather this crisis and come out ahead. 
 
 Salesforce is a global leader in integrated customer relationship management, which gives all departments in a company – from marketing and sales to commerce and service – a single, shared view of every user, allowing them to deliver the personalized experiences that their customers expect.

 Accelerating out of crisis requires speed, flexibility, and resilience, and small businesses need the right tools to stay connected with their employees, customers, and community. Salesforce has rolled out various initiatives to help small businesses across Asia embrace digital transformation and adapt to the new normal.

653669,Does Indonesia lack an ESOP culture?," A pioneer employee of a unicorn startup in Indonesia got some money when they left the company several years ago by cashing out their  employee stock option plan (ESOP) . The employee didn’t tell  Tech in Asia  the exact amount, but it was enough to buy “instant noodles for a housing complex” or “ siomay  from hundreds of stalls.” 
 “The process was so simple. I only had to tell the founder, who took care of everything,” the employee recalls. 
 A middle manager at a multinational tech company in Indonesia says that staff could get around 60% profit by exercising their ESOPs after the company lists. Some of them have stocks worth 500 million rupiahs (US$34,200). Once exercised, they could receive 800 million rupiahs (US$54,700) – or about 15 years’ salary for the average Jakartan. 
 These stories are examples of how startup employees in the country can get a large amount of money from cashing out their shares. Not everyone, however, gets the same privilege.

 A former executive says that despite joining Traveloka during its early years, they have no ESOP. “The company didn’t implement the ESOP mechanism until recently,” they note. Traveloka hasn’t responded to  Tech in Asia ’s multiple requests for comment. 
 Another Indonesian unicorn, Ovo, hasn’t implemented an ESOP for its employees. But a former company executive publicly mentioned on LinkedIn that one of his jobs was to “manage and process” ESOPs. 
 Tina Nugraheni, deputy managing director at recruitment agency Monroe Consulting Group, says that stock still isn’t a major draw for the archipelago’s tech talents. “They prefer cash or instant benefit,” she observes. 
 Achmad Alkatiri, who was a Shopee marketing executive and Lazada’s chief marketing officer, also says that Indonesian workers still prefer higher salaries, so ESOP isn’t popular in Indonesia. “In other countries, most startup employees became rich because of ESOP, not salary,” he said  on Twitter . 
 A lot of this has to do with the lack of major acquisitions or public listings in Indonesia’s fledgling tech scene. Young ecosystems often face a chicken and egg situation: Without good employees, startups are less likely to succeed. But without successful startups that can turn employees into millionaires, there won’t be big exits that make ESOPs attractive. 
    
     
 Tokopedia and Bukalapak declined to respond to  Tech in Asia ’s questions about whether they have implemented an ESOP program, but former and existing staff say that they’ve done so. A Tokopedia employee also stated on LinkedIn that “advising and drafting” the ESOP procedure is part of her job. 
 More companies, however, may be seeing the value of ESOPs. Gojek is the only Indonesian unicorn that openly says that it has an equity program for “eligible candidates.” Ex-employees told  Tech in Asia  that it has been implemented since the company’s early years. 
 Kargo, a new logistics startup in Indonesia, mentions that since its establishment, it has given all full-time staff shares in the company. 
 “By owning a part of the company, we hope employees will go above and beyond to achieve success together as a team,” Tiger Fang, Kargo’s chief executive, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Set it up early 
 The unnamed pioneer employee explains that Indonesian startups usually give ESOPs because they can’t afford to match a worker’s previous salary. 
 “For example, the employee’s monthly salary was US$2,000. But the [new] company can only afford US$1,400, so it compensates for the difference by giving ESOP,” the anonymous employee says. 
 Joshua Agusta, director of venture capital firm Mandiri Capital Indonesia, says that he usually suggests founders to spare 10% of the company’s shares for ESOP in the first fundraise. If the company needs key hires after the fundraise, the pool should be enlarged. 
 Kargo’s Fang believes that implementing ESOP should be done as early as possible because startups need to hire the right people in the early stage. 
 He also thinks that having an ESOP during the seed round will be the most valuable. This can be a very appealing part of an employee’s compensation structure if a startup wants to get highly capable people who would most likely be paid with plenty of cash in other jobs. 
 ESOP can also be included with the ‘tag along’ or ‘drag along’ terms. 
 Another tricky thing about offering ESOP in Indonesia is its legality under the country’s law. Rahmat Dwi Putranto, founder of LegalGo, says that there are no rules about ESOP in Indonesia. 
 “Companies have to work on specific agreements outside their  Articles of Association . After the vesting period has been reached, then the employee’s name can be put into the list of company’s shareholders,” he explains. ESOP can also be included with the  “tag along”  or  “drag along”  terms at the time of investment, Putranto adds. 
 Some startups decide to give shares in their foreign entities because “they plan to use that entity when they get listed in the stock market,” says Bono Daru Adji, managing partner at law firm Assegaf Hamzah and Partners. He has advised an Indonesian unicorn about ESOPs.

 A company can develop its ESOP guidelines after securing shareholders’ approval. In this phase, the company doesn’t need eligible employees to sign an agreement just yet. It can begin working on a contract that must be signed by the employee once they pass their vesting period. 
 However, Adji warns that under Indonesian law, a private company mustn’t have more than 300 shareholders. If it exceeds that number, the company will be treated as a public company. As such, it’s required to disclose its private information. That’s why even if eligible employees have passed the vesting period, there’s a possibility that they won’t receive their shares right away. 
 “Companies usually accommodate them by creating a contract mentioning that employees can get a certain amount of shares after the IPO and other related clauses,” Adji says. 
 Errors can also happen while founders are setting up their ESOPs, according to LegalGo’s Putranto. “Some of them put the names of their employees directly in the Articles of Association. When I ask them about it, what they actually wanted to implement is an ESOP,” he says. 
 How attractive are ESOPs? 
 A former executive who helped develop the ESOP mechanism of a fintech startup in Indonesia explains to  Tech in Asia  that the company offered employee shares because it wanted to do an IPO and get quality employees. 
 However, the ex-executive admits that the proposition wasn’t compelling enough because while the vision was there, the exit strategy didn’t seem feasible. 
 “Asking people to stay for four to five years and sacrificing some part of their salary to work in a private company, is not really attractive,” they say. “It’s different with companies that have been listed in the stock exchange, where the stocks can be sold directly in the public market.” 
 While the ex-executive got some offers from other companies to get significant ESOPs in exchange for pay cuts, they weren’t enticing enough. 
 I believe ESOPs will be much more valuable than cash in the future 
 The multinational tech company employee joined the firm before it had an ESOP, so that wasn’t what lured her in. However, the company eventually compensated employees with ESOP without reducing their salary. 
 “It’s like a bonus to retain employees. I don’t even know the calculation,” she says. 
 Monroe’s Nugraheni explains that many companies don’t talk about ESOPs during the recruitment phase because at that point, an IPO or M&amp;A seems like a distant event. “Many companies don’t explain because [the shares are] basically ‘worth equal to zero’ unless there is an exit,” she says. 
 Kargo CEO Fang admits that the majority of people in Indonesia aren’t familiar with how ESOP works so they don’t understand its value. “I believe the key is to educate them and make them realize that ESOPs will be much more valuable than cash in the future,” he states. 
 Cashing out 
 The most tricky part of ESOP is cashing it out, especially for private companies. On paper, employees in unicorn startups may have a huge amount of money because of the company’s high valuation, but they may not get the cash right away due to the complexity of the process. 
 They have to sell it to other parties or sell it back to the company. Outside of an official buyback scheme, the sale is usually done through brokers or nascent exchanges such as Singapore’s Fundnel. Buyers are often  tempted by discounts  on the company’s valuation, but if these aren’t available, then they can just join the next funding round. 
 The companies can often block any new investor from joining their capitalization table through a right of first refusal. They’re likely to push back on any trade that carries a heavy markdown, as it sends the wrong signal to the market. 
 In a public or more established company, the cash-out process can be simpler. The multinational company employee says that they only have to notify the local human resources team when they want to exercise their ESOP. 
 Employees can then input the data on a dashboard by themselves and transfer the money according to the strike price. It took about a month for the money to be transferred to their bank account. 
 Some private companies decided to create a buyback share program to accommodate their ESOP holders. Former Shopee executive Alkatiri shared  on Twitter  that many startups are doing the same for their employees nowadays. “It will build an awareness of ESOP in Indonesia. Personally, I have felt the benefit of ESOP,” he says.

 Adji of Assegaf Hamzah and Partners points out that some Indonesian startups don’t want to establish a buyback program because they want to allocate their money to other aspects of the business. But having such a program enables companies to give shares to other employees and allow founders or other investors to increase their ownership. 
 “It’s OK under the Indonesian law, as long as the companies set the rules on who can sell the shares, when they can sell it, and other clauses,” Adji observes. 
 An ex-startup executive says that his former company allows its employees to cash out their ESOPs on an “extraordinary event,” which happens every year but has no specific date. All eligible staff have an option to sell the shares back to the company via that event. 
 The buyback program is usually set up by companies that have been operating for more than four years and have several employees who have passed the vesting period. 
 Selling shares in the private market can result in 25% tax under the Indonesian law. 
 Cashing out ESOPs can be more difficult right now because of the pandemic, according to an Indonesian venture capitalist. It’s even tougher for employees of a company that’s been heavily affected by the crisis. 
 “The best time to cash out ESOP is when the company raises another round of funding. For example, [if] the company just raised a Series D round, your share will be bought when the new investor comes in,” they say. 
 However, Assegaf Hamzah and Partners’ Adji says that selling shares in the private market can result in 25% tax under the Indonesian law, while people who sell their shares after an IPO can get a tax incentive and only have to pay 0.1% from the gross transaction value. 
 Short-term profits 
 People tend to exercise their ESOP right away when the vested period is done or when the startup finally does an IPO or is acquired. 
 The multinational company employee said that she and her colleagues cashed out because they were tired of working really hard. They wanted to be compensated by the profit from the ESOP. Some of them even resigned after cashing out. 
 I treat my ESOPs like an investment 
 The Indonesian unicorn ex-staff sold all of the shares when they quit the company. “I don’t want to think in a complex way, especially about money. So when I let go of the company, I let go of everything.” 
 However, some people keep their ESOPs even after leaving the company, hoping that its value can be higher in the future. 
 “I treat my ESOPs like an investment,” Amal Agung Cahyadi tells  Tech in Asia . He says that he still holds shares from some of his former employers, which include two Indonesian unicorns and several startups. 
 Other startup employees in the country have different ESOP stories. 
 One ex-senior manager told  Tech in Asia  that it was the startup’s ESOP that convinced him to leave a big company and take a significant pay cut. He thought the startup had a good market and the potential to be acquired by larger firms. 
 But he eventually quit after being disappointed with the founders and how the startup was being run. 
 A tech executive resigned when the company distributed her ESOP as it was preparing to IPO. She made the move out of “idealism,” saying that she didn’t to factor in money in her career progress. But she admits feeling a little regret at seeing how their former colleagues could cash out their ESOPs and make a profit. 
 Monroe’s Nugraheni has also heard about these experiences, but she says things have changed recently. Many tech employees who want to leave their current job “will sacrifice their ESOPs and try to get it compensated by having a signing bonus” from their new company.

 TradeGecko’s inventory and order management capabilities will also be integrated with Intuit-developed accounting platform QuickBooks’ suite of financial, payment, reporting and accounting tools. 
 According to a statement, the acquisition will allow the customers of QuickBooks Online to launch and manage products across both online and offline sales channels as well as manage orders and inventory fulfillment from various channels and across several inventory locations. 
 “Small businesses around the world are struggling to survive in this rapidly changing environment,” said Alex Chriss, executive vice president and general manager of QuickBooks. “The need for a single tool that can reduce operational complexity for product-based businesses is acute.” 
 Founded in 2012, TradeGecko served customers in more than 100 countries, processing over US$5 billion in gross merchandise volume. Its investors include Openspace Ventures, Wavemaker Partners, and 500 Startups, among others. 
 QuickBooks, meanwhile, serves more than 7 million small businesses around the world. It helps companies get paid, manage capital, and pay employees. 
 Cameron Priest, CEO and co-founder at TradeGecko, described the deal as an opportunity that his company “couldn’t pass up.” 
 Earlier this year, the startup  laid off  35 of its 125 employees in an effort to “reduce costs and maintain growth,” Priest previously told  Tech in Asia . He also said that the company was on track to break even this year. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(3, 0.99953103)]","['TradeGecko', 'QuickBooks', 'Intuit']","['Asia', 'US', 'Singapore']"

 With the new service, Singapore users will be able to “invest as they spend” with their everyday Grab transactions. They may invest as low as S$1 per transaction made with Grab services to earn returns of about 1.8% per year, which can then be cashed out directly to their GrabPay wallets. 
 The users’ investments are then put into high-quality, liquid fixed income funds offered by Fullerton Fund Management and UOB Asset Management. AutoInvest charges a low all-inclusive fee, and will be available to eligible users in Singapore through GrabInvest by early September. 
 Grab has also announced other products, including consumer loans through a third-party platform. In addition, it has expanded its buy-now-pay-later service for select ecommerce websites so users can either split their payments into monthly instalments via PayLater Instalments or defer payment to the following month via PayLater Postpaid. 
 Grab plans to have a handful of online merchants offering its PayLater services at launch, then add over 100 more in Singapore and Malaysia by the end of the year. 
 The new products were launched under Grab Financial’s “Thrive with Grab” strategy and builds upon the company’s “ Grow with Grab ” initiative, where its merchant financial services ecosystem was started. 
 “Our ‘Thrive with Grab’ strategy will enable users to build their wealth, manage their finances, and protect what they value during this uncertain period,” said Grab Financial senior managing director Reuben Lai, adding that the products launched today are “evergreen.” 
 Since launching its consumer insurance business in 2019, Grab Financial claims to have seen robust growth across Southeast Asia, having over 13 million insurance policies issued since April 2019. It has also since expanded small and medium-sized enterprise lending to four countries to support its food and payments merchants. 
 “What’s really exciting is that if we execute well, there’s a full revenue potential opportunity of US$60 billion by 2025 for digital financial services,” Lai said.

653378,Yammer’s pitch deck that helped it raise its next $17m,"     
 ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
 Founded in 2008, Yammer is an enterprise social network that brings together employees, content, conversations, and business data in a single location. It connects the organization’s front-runners or top-level leaders back at headquarters to see everyone’s progress come together. 
 In 2012, Microsoft acquired Yammer for US$1.2 billion, integrating it with Office 365’s suite of services. The startup’s founder and CEO David O. Sacks left Yammer and Microsoft in 2014 and later launched an early-stage VC firm called Craft Ventures. 
 Microsoft has been  actively investing  on Yammer, Seth Patton, a 15-year veteran at Microsoft who works on Office 365, previously said. 
 The product is up against business communications platform Slack, which claims to have more than 12 million daily active users and 119,000 paid customers. Google and Facebook have also joined the race in the enterprise social product space by launching Hangouts Chat and Workplace by Facebook, respectively. 
  Fundraising journey  
 
 2009: US$5 million from the Founders Fund and Charles River Ventures 
 February 2010: US$10 million from Emergence Capital, Ron Conway, and previous investors 
 November 2010: US$25 million from US Venture Partners, Emergence Capital, Charles River Ventures, and Founders Fund 
 2011: US$17 million from The Social+Capital Partnership, Charles River Ventures, Emergence Capital, and US Venture Partners 
 2012: US$85 million from DFJ growth, Social+Capital Partnership, Meritech, Khosla Ventures, Capricorn, Charles River Ventures, Founders Fund, USVP, and Emergence Capital Partners 
 
  How is the deck compelling?  
 
 The deck uses charts and numbers to clearly illustrate a number of real-life difficulties people usually face at work and how much it costs for a company to address those issues. 
 It makes sure it introduces the company in a very concise manner. 
 By sharing testimonies from real and active users such as electronics major LG, the company is able to prove that its product can help businesses save three hours a week – which equates to a 7.5% productivity increase on a typical workweek, or around US$7,500 saved per employee a year.

653257,"Taranis eyes Asia expansion after raising $30m from Vertex, others"," Israeli startup  Taranis  is ready to bring drones and AI to Asia’s agritech scene after raising US$30 million in a series C round led by Vertex Growth and Orion Fund, a fund backed by Southeast Asian conglomerate Kuok Group and managed by K3 Ventures.

 New investors Hitachi Ventures, Mitsubishi UFJ Capital, Micron Ventures, UMC Capital, La Maison, Mindset Ventures, iAngels, and Gal Yarden also participated in the round. Existing investors Vertex Ventures Israel, Viola Ventures, Finistere, and OurCrowd pitched in as well. 
  What problem is it solving?  Taranis combines aerial imagery with AI to identify and analyze crop threats such as insect infestation, disease, weeds, and nutrient deficiencies. Its prescription engine then recommends treatment to help farmers prevent crop yield loss. 
 “Until recently, growers have had to wait on time-consuming manual scouting to assess threats, formulate an action plan, and react,” Ofir Schlam, CEO and co-founder of Taranis, said. 
 Scouting, a critical part of the growing process, is largely conducted manually and selectively. Taranis said its solution could help optimize the coverage, precision, and turnaround time of this process. 
 Using planes and drones, its proprietary AI2 SmartScout Solutions can capture quality images of a field, covering 100 acres in six minutes. It comes up with a diagnosis 20 times faster and with 20 times more data points scouted than manual means, the company claims. 
 Taranis offers a full-service scheme, taking care of all operations and logistics, including drone pods and operators for image capturing. It also recently launched a self-operation scheme, where it trains its clients to operate flights. 
  What are its future plans?  With nearly US$60 million in total funding to date, Taranis aims to further scale its solutions and bring them to Asia. 
 “In Asia, the agriculture food industry is unable to keep up with the region’s burgeoning population growth and demand,” the company said, adding that it could help improve crop yields for row crop growers across the region. It believes the market presents a lot of longer-term opportunities, especially with growers of sugarcane, soy, and wheat. 
 Taranis has so far completed a week-long pilot on sugarcane crops in Indonesia – its first entry into Asia.  It said it could also potentially expand to Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. 
 Asia has around 23% of the world’s agricultural land, producing  60%  of the world’s food. In Southeast Asia, 16% of the land is used for agricultural purposes. The agriculture industry is valued at over  US$620 billion  annually and contributes up to 10% of the region’s gross domestic product. 
 Some agritech players in the space include  Myanmar’s Village Link , which is also focused on improving crop yields, and Chinese agricultural drone maker XAG. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  The US-based company has about 200 customers for its AI2 service. It also monitors more than 2 million acres of commodity crops and 20 million acres of land globally for over 19,000 customers in the US, Canada, Latin American, Russia, Ukraine, and Australia. 
 Taranis currently employs over 80 people worldwide. 
  What is its funding history?

 Hello readers, 
 Welcome to another work week! In today’s edition, we look at: 
 
 The startups in Indonesia with the comfiest cash cushions 
 How e-wallets can be key to Grab and Gojek’s profitability 
 A Tencent-partnered startup’s newly raised funds 
 
  But first, your quick bytes for today:    
1️⃣ “ Hong Kong or Shanghai ?” is a question that ByteDance has been mulling over as it looks to list its China business. Rumor has it, though, that it prefers the former. The Beijing-based company was valued at up to US$140 billion earlier this year. 
 2️⃣ Meanwhile, in the far west, TikTok is reportedly in talks to  sell itself to Microsoft  and other companies after US president Donald Trump vowed to  ban the short-video app  in the country. To save TikTok’s US ambition, sources say that parent company ByteDance has agreed to  divest its US operations . 
 3️⃣ Vietnamese ecommerce marketplace Sendo has spoken: The much-anticipated merger with its rival Tiki is likely  not happening  at this point. Instead, Sendo is looking to start its series D fundraising. 
 If the Tiki-Sendo merger had gone through, it would have  shaken up  Vietnam’s US$35 billion ecommerce sector. 
 4️⃣ Apple has a brand-new title, and that’s “the world’s most valuable publicly listed company.” Thanks to last quarter’s performance, Apple’s stocks  surged over 10% , adding US$172 billion in market capitalization. FYI, that amount is greater than the entire stock market value of Oracle Corp. 
 5️⃣ Chinese electric-car maker Li Auto also had a pretty good week, debuting on Nasdaq last Thursday and promptly raising  US$1.1 billion  in its US initial public offering. 
 6️⃣ Step aside, YouTube: Facebook is bringing in  music videos  from the likes of T-Series Music, Zee Music Company, and Yash Raj Films onto Facebook Watch in India. 
 
 The Indonesian startups with the comfiest cash cushions 
   
 
 Home to more than 6,000 startups, Indonesia’s startup ecosystem is ginormous. Just last week alone, investors poured more than  US$250 million  worth of funding into the archipelago, with the lion’s share going to travel unicorn Traveloka 
 Much has been said about Indonesia’s impending boom this decade and how entrepreneurs and investors can capitalize on the opportunities. But for this growth to be sustainable, the country has to curb one major issue:  childhood stunting . 
 Apart from unicorns like Gojek, Tokopedia and Traveloka, which startups have built sizable capital war chests? We highlighted the top 20 in  this article .

 Grab and Gojek want you to put your money where your e-wallet is 
   
What’s the missing ingredient in Grab and Gojek’s profitability recipe? According to the Southeast Asian giants, it’s online food delivery -given  Meituan’s success in China , this could be a valid point. 
 But Chinese investment bank China Renaissance is saying nah ah:  E-wallets  could be the real deal. 
 
 
 Learn from Alipay  is what the China Renaissance is suggesting. Online payment platform Alipay is partly owned by Alibaba and accounted for 25% of the tech titan’s Q1 net profit. 
 
 Legislation favors e-wallets, too : Singapore and Malaysia – two crucial markets for both Grab and Gojek – have started issuing digital bank licenses, presenting a massive opportunity for the super apps to tap into a larger user market.  
 
 Grab is already gunning for it  as it formed a consortium with telecommunications firm Singtel to apply for a digital full bank license in Singapore. But competition is going to be tough as they’re going up against  other applicants , including regional  heavyweight Sea .

 The startup that acts as the pipes connecting different countries 
   
A fintech startup that Tencent partnered with in 2017 has recently raised  US$20 million  in a series B funding round. 
 
 
 Founded in 2014 , Hong Kong-based EMQ helps make cross-border payments easier for services like ecommerce, procurement, remittance, payroll and more. 
 
 Busy since 2017 : Not only has EMQ rolled out a new enterprise payment solution, but it has also increased its licenses from two to five, bumped up its payout capability from four markets to over 80, and strengthened its coverage in China to over 130 banks. 
 
 Thanks to all that,  the startup saw its historical annual transaction volume in the past 12 consecutive months soar by 70x.

653639,Grab said to raise $200m from Korea’s Stic Investments," Singapore-based ride-hailing giant  Grab  is said to be raising US$200 million from Stic Investments as the South Korean private equity firm aims to increase its exposure in Southeast Asia.

 Stic will be investing US$100 million from one of its funds, while the remaining amount will come from co-investors,  Bloomberg  reported, citing people familiar with the development. 
  Tech in Asia  has reached out to Grab for a statement, but the startup declined to comment on the matter. 
 Founded in 1999, Stic engages in growth capital investments, buyouts, and secondary market transactions. According to its website, it invests in companies that have the potential for intrinsic growth, which are often willing to form partnerships with the Stic team. 
 Some of its investments include Korean entertainment giant YG Entertainment, Indian on-demand delivery and errand services platform Dunzo, and China’s Joyvio Group, the food and agribusiness arm of Legend Holdings. 
 Stic’s reported capital injection into Grab comes as the global ride-hailing segment strives to recover amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Grab, which was estimated to be valued at around US$14 billion last year, has already  let go  of 360 employees less than two months ago to cut back on spending. 
 Its regional rival Gojek took similar measures,  laying off  430 employees, or roughly 9% of its total headcount. 
 The US$200 million top-up may help Grab bounce back and prepare for “a potentially  long winter ” ahead. “There is a lot of uncertainty as to the depth and duration of the pandemic, and we don’t know how long the economic recession will last,” a Grab spokesperson previously told  Tech in Asia . 
 Grab had previously raised a total of nearly US$10 billion  from investors  such as SoftBank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Toyota, Experian, Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs, among others.

653597,A primer on how eSIMs can change the telco game," On July 21, the Singapore-headquartered Circles Life launched its eSIM service that allows users to sign up and activate their mobile plans without the need for a physical SIM card. 
 The product is the latest initiative by the digital telco to make customer onboarding easier and safer in a time of social distancing. With eSIMs, consumers can activate and use their mobile plan within three minutes of signing up, removing the step of having the physical SIM card delivered to their doorstep.

 “Users can easily activate their accounts in the comfort of their homes, without going out or needing a physical third person verification,” Rameez Ansar, co-founder of Circles Life, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Notably, users can toggle between their physical SIM and their eSIM anytime, allowing them to switch between two lines even if their phone doesn’t support a second physical SIM card. This kind of convenience echoes the big shift that happened in the software and video industries, where the internet has replaced DVDs as the main mode of delivering content. 
 What are eSIMs? 
 ESIMs are just like physical SIM cards, except they are directly embedded into the phone’s hardware. Physical SIMs are a relic of a past – they were also meant to store messages and contact information, but those functions have been taken over by the phone itself. 
 ESIMs have a smaller form factor that provides phone manufacturers extra space for other components or even the option of producing a thinner device.

 ESIMs promise consumers more freedom, convenience, and choice. Once adopted by the industry, they can directly connect and switch to any carrier via software, making it easier for users to try a wide variety of telco products offered by different providers since they would no longer have to insert a small plastic card into their devices every time they switch to a new mobile network. 
 For travelers, this means doing away with waiting in line at the airport to get a tourist SIM. 
 Telcos’ resistance to adoption of eSIMs 
 ESIMs are relatively new. NanoSims were first introduced in phones in  2012 , while eSIMs hit the consumer market  four years later . 
 But eSIMs have now been introduced in most new smartphones today. In fact, by 2025, about 2 billion newly shipped smartphones are  expected  to be eSIM-compatible – that’s nearly all the smartphones in the world. 
 The primary reason for the slow adoption of eSIM technology is the reluctance of many telco providers to support it, given that the ease of switching carriers could increase customer churn rates and reduce roaming revenue. 
 With the latest models of smartphones no longer requiring physical SIM cards, telco carriers have the most to lose from the adoption of eSIMs. It doesn’t help that they generally have been stuck on the mindset of locking in users with prohibitive subscriptions rather than persuading them to remain loyal customers. 
 Singtel had begun issuing eSIM-compatible services back in 2017 but it quickly stopped soon after. 
 Meanwhile, in the US, things got so heated in 2018 that the U.S. Justice Department began an  anti-trust investigation  into Verizon, AT&amp;T, and GSMA for allegedly colluding to establish standards that would have locked a device to a network even if it had eSIM capabilities. 
 On the flipside, India is ahead of the curve, with Airtel and Reliance Jio offering eSIM activation since  2018 .

 From an operational perspective, eSIMs offer telcos higher efficiency with how they reduce the necessity of managing physical deliveries of SIMs. They cut down the need for retail space too. And yet many large telcos still prioritize finding ways to lock-in their customers with contracts and other barriers. 
 It is interesting to note that the technology has been better received in other new applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT) where there aren’t any preexisting consumers for large telcos to lose. 
 While Circles Life is currently among the few telcos that are doing an early rollout of eSIM compatibility, its move could be a sign of the times. ESIMs could soon change the telco landscape because it can change up business tactics in the industry and offer significant new consumer use cases, such as the following: 
 1. Travel roaming 
 Frequent travelers know the pain of having to line up for a tourist SIM every time they land in a new country (or, if they’re in a rush, having to pay for exorbitant roaming rates). This pain point opens the doors for a telco startup that’s laser-focused on making overseas communication easier. 
 For example, a travel-oriented service could offer a flat rate for data usage across dozens of countries, giving consumers peace of mind over their phone bill. Consumers who travel frequently can simply change their local carriers in each country without the need to physically change or purchase a SIM card. 
 This gap in the market is exactly what the  travel eSIM startup Airalo  is looking to address. The Singapore-based company provides consumers access to data packages across 190+ countries via their eSIM store. Using the company’s mobile app, customers can browse through the listed destinations then simply scan a QR code on their desired data package. 
 The service would then be automatically installed on their devices’ eSIM, allowing them to enjoy local data rates.

 As telcos cater to more data-hungry consumers who wield many internet-connected gadgets, there could be rising demand for services that allow users to leverage the same data plan for several devices wherever they may go. 
 In November last year, global Wi-Fi startup Skyroam  raised US$20m  in a C2 round led by Mesh Ventures and Phi Ventures. The company uses its patented virtual eSIM platform to provide portable software-based Wi-Fi hotspots across 130 countries around the world, enabling users to turn on a Skyroam device and connect to local carrier signals for data – again, without the need for physical plastic SIM cards. 
 The technology works by storing the eSIM card data of Skyroam’s global network partners in its data center. When a Skyroam router searches for a network, it automatically connects to the strongest signal and dynamically switches across networks to whatever is most suitable at the time. Notably, up to 10 devices can connect to each portable router.

 2. Instant switching between different types of telco services 
 With the rollout of 5G technologies, it will become easier for telcos to offer personalized data plans unique to consumers’ needs. ESIMs help lay the foundations for this development by offering consumers the ability to seamlessly shift between different types of services based on their needs at any given time. 
 For example, when performing routine tasks such as video calling or downloading files, consumers can rely on a more “volume-oriented” service that provides a large data allowance at moderate speeds. Then, when playing mobile games, they can easily shift to a secondary package linked to their eSIM that provides high-speed, low latency connections. 
 According to Circles Life, average data consumption among users has shot up from 11GB/month in 2019 to 15GB/month in 2020 as consumers use tools like Google Hangouts and Zoom more frequently. These findings are corroborated by a June 2020 survey conducted by global financial services firm UBS that found increased data usage linked to online videos and digital banking (60% in 2020 vs. 46% in 2017) as well as office productivity apps (28% in 2020 vs. 20% in 2017). 
 
  Source: UBS, Zero One 
 
 This trend is expected to only become more pronounced over time as services built around eSIM and 5G technologies better fulfill customer’s needs – pushing them to consume more data. 
 3. Trial services 
 In the same way Netflix and many cloud software companies offer trial periods, telcos will be able to try the same tactic with the help of eSIMs. On the consumers’ end, trying a new telco service could become as simple as scanning a QR code. 
 The challenge here, though, would be for each telco to convince a potential customer to stay on rather than leaving them to enjoy another free trial period, this time from a rival. 
 Unlike video-streaming sites or software, which have unique content or features to hook customers, telcos are mostly invisible, with their presence felt only whenever there’s a disruption. 
 While telcos have tried to layer services on top of their pipes, it’s been a mixed bag in terms of success – with  Singtel’s Hooq  as a prominent example. 
 Circles Life, meanwhile, has been trying to position its app as a lifestyle service rather than simply a way to track data usage. How far it can bring this idea, though, remains unclear. 
 Perhaps a solution would be to offer eSIM mobile plans as a gateway to established internet services through exclusive partnerships and bundles, which is something telcos are already doing with their physical SIM plans. 
 Caveats 
 From a consumer’s standpoint, there are tradeoffs with using eSIMs. For one, it would be hard to extract the data from it if the phone breaks down – not a problem with an extractable SIM card. 
 Second, privacy-minded folks might be concerned about the difficulty of fully disconnecting from a telco network. 
 Third – and perhaps the most significant downside – is the difficulty in changing consumer habits. Older users might stick to physical SIM cards out of familiarity. 
 From a business standpoint, eSIMs could end up benefiting the dominant players that own the pipes as well as multiple revenue streams. They could afford to bide their time and, when they’re ready, launch a competing service to battle against the upstart telcos. 
   
 Players like Circles Life, meanwhile, have to bear the cost of educating consumers in Singapore about eSIMs. 
 This is a scene that has played out before: Whenever mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) or upstarts launch a novel idea, incumbents with the exact same product won’t be far behind. 
 eSIMs could bridge the gap to the 5G era 
 Regardless of how the competition plays out, consumers will ultimately benefit from it. In the same way that some people use different credit cards for different purposes, with eSIMs, consumers have the ability to choose what plan works best for them in a given circumstance – plus the option to swap back and forth. 
 Telco startups will be encouraged to produce or partner up with laser-focused services designed to address specific use cases. It can also be expected that widespread usage of eSIMs will encourage an even larger shift toward prepaid plans as opposed to phone-subsidized ones. 
 Smaller telcos in countries where logistics costs are high, such as Indonesia and Vietnam, will benefit even more from a reduction in the need to invest in physical SIM card distribution and retail touchpoints. 
 While everyone waits for 5G to expand the opportunities for telco innovation in the future, eSIMs could be a major driver in the meantime.

653603,Microsoft to continue talks to buy TikTok," Global tech giant  Microsoft  said it’s prepared to continue exploring the purchase of  TikTok  in the US following a conversation between its CEO Satya Nadella and US President Donald Trump.

 The Bill Gates-founded company will “move quickly” to pursue talks with TikTok’s parent company ByteDance in a matter of weeks and complete the discussions by September 15 this year, according to a  statement . 
 “During this process, Microsoft looks forward to continuing dialogue with the US government, including with the President,” the company added. 
 According to the computer software leader, its discussions with ByteDance will build upon a notification made by the two companies to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US of their intent to explore the purchase of TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 
 If a deal materializes, Microsoft would own and operate TikTok in these markets. The company may also invite other American parties to act as minority investors in the purchase. 
 Microsoft would then focus on addressing Trump’s concerns over the short-video app. “[Microsoft] is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury,” it said in the statement. 
 The company plans to shift the operating model for TikTok to ensure transparency to users and that all private data of the app’s American users is transferred to and remains in the US. 
 In an August 2 interview with  Fox News , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed that Chinese software companies in the US, including TikTok and WeChat, have been feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist party. 
 “Could be their facial recognition patterns. It could be information about their residence, their phone numbers, their friends, who they’re connected to. Those are the issues that President Trump has made clear we’re going to take care of,” he said. 
 Prior to this, Trump said that he might ban the app in the US over safety concerns. TikTok has previously maintained that it stores its US user data on US-based servers and backs it up in Singapore, and that it’s not subject to Chinese law.

 Deep-thinking reads 
   
1️⃣ The talent war is fierce in the tech industry, with companies dangling big salaries to win over the best candidates. A recent academic study found that this is mostly the  work of venture capitalists : VC-backed startups pay roughly 10% more than incumbent firms. 
 Generous  salaries are also the norm  in Southeast Asia, with Grab and Razer as examples. But the economic fallout from Covid-19 has  shined a light  on these companies’ human resource policies and practices. 
 2️⃣ Peter Lauten and Martin Casado of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz  wrote  about a shift in go-to market strategies among enterprise firms. “[A] shock to the system is emerging today, driven not by the underlying technology, but by an evolution in customer buying behavior. For shorthand, we think of this trend as “growth+sales”: the bottom-up growth motion eventually layered with top-down sales.” 
 3️⃣ We can all learn a thing or two from the  Luckin Coffee fiasco , especially investors. “[…] tech startups are pushed to expand with a “grow-at-all-cost” mindset. But when that drive is coupled with weak corporate governance, it can lead to trouble.” 
 Speaking of grow at all costs and high burn, the pandemic has also underscored the value of maintaining a long runway. Six months is  just too short  to support recovery, unfortunately. 
 4️⃣ Benedict Evans ponders “ regulating technology ” . “I started my career, in 1999, at an investment bank in London that had 900 people and one (1) compliance person. Today it might have 100x that. So, how many compliance people will Google have in five years?” 
 5️⃣ This piece  suggests  that tech stocks prices aren’t as closely tied to actual performance. If some of the “Covid-winning companies” (i.e., Netflix and Microsoft) are starting to see slower growth, that seems to suggest we’re going to go through tougher times ahead.

653570,ByteDance reportedly mulls listing China biz in Hong Kong or Shanghai," Chinese tech giant ByteDance, which operates popular short-video app TikTok, is considering listing its China business in Hong Kong or Shanghai,  Reuters  reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

 According to sources, the company prefers to list in Hong Kong and has been in talks with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing as well as Chinese securities regulators. 
 It also plans to list its non-China business, which includes TikTok, in Europe or the US, the sources said, adding that ByteDance had originally wanted to list as a combined entity in New York or Hong Kong. 
 Discussions are still at an early stage, the sources noted. 
  Tech in Asia  has reached out to ByteDance to learn more about its IPO plans, but a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on “market rumors.” 
 The report comes as US-listed Chinese companies face tighter regulations following the  Luckin Coffee fiasco . Chinese online travel major Ctrip and top search engine Baidu are said to be  considering delisting  from Nasdaq amid rising US-China tension. 
 ByteDance was reported to have recorded a net profit of more than  US$3 billion  last year, driven by a significant growth in user traffic that lured advertisers from Tencent and Baidu. It also generated  US$5.6 billion  in revenue in the first quarter and has set a revenue target of about US$28.6 billion for this year. 
 The Beijing-based company was recently valued at up to US$140 billion earlier this year, according to  Reuters . The sources said a standalone listing in Hong Kong or Shanghai may value its China business at more than US$100 billion.

653552,A founder sued by his former startup,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Hello readers, 
 Shutting down a startup and then launching a brand new one sounds like a straightforward plan. Haven’t we all read a couple of stories of founders who had failed and closed down their companies – and then succeeded with their next big idea? 
 But the process is actually far more complicated than that, and today, we look at one such founder who got himself wrapped up in an ongoing legal dispute with his previous startup. 
 Read the  full story  or scroll down for a summary. 
  Here are your quick bytes for today:    
1️⃣ Uber says “not yet” to its previous announcement of relocating its Asia-Pacific hub to Hong Kong. For now, the US-based ride-hailing giant plans to keep its  APAC hub in Singapore  until at least December 2022. 
 2️⃣ GudangAda, a business-to-business marketplace in Indonesia, had  let go of  25 employees. This comes after it recruited former executives at  Sorabel  and  Stoqo  — both startups that were shuttered due to the economic impact of Covid-19. 
 3️⃣ It’s a  two-in-one celebration  for Thailand’s Line Man, the delivery app of messaging app Line, as it has banked US$110 million and merged with local food app Wongnai Media. Tech startups  are rising  in Thailand, and the country is in a good position to “be the  cannabis tech hub  not just of Southeast Asia but of the world,” said an investor. 
 4️⃣ Huawei may be feeling the heat from U.S. government restrictions, but it still managed to take the  top handset-maker  spot from Samsung, thanks to its dominance in China sales. The Chinese tech giant  has come a long way : Founder Ren Zhengfei had been part of the Communist Party before moving to Shenzhen to work in the city’s then-fledgling electronics industry. He founded Huawei in 1987. 
 5️⃣ Japan is also looking to  restrict  Chinese apps such as Tiktok. This comes after  India  banned the video app last month and the ongoing deliberation by the  U.S. government  to do the same. 
 6️⃣ Chinese food delivery giant Meituan-Dianping has  blocked  the use of Alipay as a payment option for some users on its super app. It is likely a move to push users to use its own Meituan Pay as it advances its  super-app ambition  and fends off pressure from Alibaba. 
 Despite the pandemic, Meituan-Dianping has had a great 2020 so far, with its market cap hitting an all-time high at US$157 billion this month. It’s the only food delivery giant that turned a profit in 2019,  making a great case study  for counterparts such as Uber, Grab, Grubhub, and Gojek. 
 
 Getting sued by your former startup is something different 
   
Sy Phong Bui is the founder of Telio, a business-to-business ecommerce marketplace in Vietnam. He is also the former founder of fintech company OnOnPay, whose board of directors has an ongoing lawsuit filed against him. 
 
 
 It wasn’t a clean break : OnOnPay claimed that Telio was born thanks to its resources such as “employees, technology, [and] know-how,” its database of customers and merchants, and its website where Telio had conducted its trial run.  
 
 A more attractive sibling : Besides getting into the accelerator program under venture capital firm Sequoia, Telio also bagged a US$25 million series A round, pushing its valuation to US$100 million. OnOnPay, on the other hand, has a total disclosed funding of US$800k. 
 
 He says, she says : None of OnOnPay’s investors appear to be shareholders in Telio. Bui’s lawyers said that OnOnPay investors were not interested in funding Telio, but OnOnPay investors called this statement false. 
 
 Dive into the whole story:  Telio founder is accused of breaching fiduciary duty by his previous startup. He denies the claims

653353,"Gojek, Grab may drive profitability via e-wallets: report"," The Covid-19 pandemic may have pummeled ride-hailing businesses globally, but research suggests that super apps such as Southeast Asian players Grab and Gojek may still hit profitability via e-wallets. 
 “While both ASEAN super apps stated publicly that online food delivery is key to their profitability, we believe the e-wallet could become the most important aspect for a super app to achieve profitability,” Chinese investment bank China Renaissance said in a recent  report . 
 
  Photo credit: The Low Down 
 
 Grab and Gojek, estimated to be valued at  US$14 billion  and  US$10 billion , respectively, as of last year, have both been eyeing profitability as they work towards going public. Gojek previously said it aims to list by 2023 or 2024, while Grab said it will go public once it’s profitable, without giving a specific timeline. 
 Last year, Gojek said that the company  aims to be profitable  in its food delivery and e-wallet businesses, adding that its ride-hailing unit, which represents less than 25% of its overall gross merchandise volume, was assumed to only break even. 
 A senior executive at Grab also noted that the company’s growing food delivery business could  drive profitability  in the long run. In 2018, its food delivery and payments units generated US$2 billion and US$6.3 billion in annual revenues, respectively, according to the company. 
 According to China Renaissance, the two regional super apps may take a leaf out of Alipay’s playbook to drive profitability. 
 Alipay is operated by fintech giant Ant Group, which is 33% owned by Alibaba. The company posted a US$611 million pretax profit in Q1 2020 and accounted for 25% of Alibaba’s reported first-quarter net profit. 
 “The deposit bases created by Grab and Gojek are unknown, but if they were to replicate the Alipay model, we think both might be able to leverage on their deposit bases to offer loans and potentially generate profit,” the report said. 
 China Renaissance pointed out that legislation is also evolving. Both Singapore and Malaysia are issuing digital bank licenses as e-wallet deposits rise. Last year, Grab has formed a  consortium with Singtel  to apply for a digital full bank license in Singapore. 
  E-wallets for a seamless consumer experience  
 The report also highlighted that ride-hailing companies such as Grab and Gojek have a key advantage in providing a seamless customer experience with their online food delivery and logistics services. 
 “Another contributor to the consumer experience is an e-wallet offering,” China Renaissance said in the report. “We note the opportunity for ride-hailing players to leverage existing technology to add to the customer experience, including offering reward points on dollars spent to drive users’ loyalty.” 
 The company predicts that the total addressable markets for food delivery and ride-hailing in Southeast Asia will grow to US$20 billion and US$25 billion, respectively, by 2025. 
 Wee Leong Gan, head of equities for ASEAN at China Renaissance, believes that ride-hailing will remain as the “core pillar” for both Gojek and Grab when it comes to retaining users and developing a complete logistics infrastructure post-Covid-19. “The overwhelming food delivery orders during the Covid-19 period had to be met by the existing ride-hailing drivers, which otherwise would have taken time to build up,” he told  Tech in Asia . 
 Meanwhile, the food delivery business has also soared by at least 5x amid the pandemic. But Gan noted that restaurant dine-in is returning to 65% to 75% of its pre-Covid-19 levels as several countries start to ease into the new normal.

653226,Key considerations for a strong SEA go-to-market strategy," At some point when startups begin scaling, founders must reevaluate their go-to-market strategy. In some ways, entering a new market is a form negotiation: There are terms that the market will set for a company, and there are those that the founder should be setting themselves. 
   
 New markets will demand things from the firm that will be unfamiliar: Maybe the startup needs to accept payments using local methods or currency. Maybe the local market calls for additional services beyond the current offerings. Or maybe it’s simply that no one in the team speaks the local language. Entering Vietnam is pretty tough if there are no Vietnamese-speaking sales, marketing, or customer success muscle present, for example. 
 In any market entry, figuring out what new capabilities are required by the market is a key factor in a startup’s decision-making process. At the same time, there are also terms that founders and CEOs should be setting themselves, with foresight on what their implications would be. 
 Requirements that the market will impose 
 Any market will have table stakes. If a company lacks these requirements or capabilities – be it a product, service, or a piece of tech – the key decision to make is whether the team needs to build these missing components, partner with someone who offers them, or buy them from somewhere else. 
   ﻿   
 Whether the company chooses to build, partner, or buy will be determined by three factors. 
 Is it possible to build the capability? 
 In some cases, it simply won’t be possible for a startup to build the missing component. In China, for example, there are legal and regulatory hurdles that bar foreign firms from operating wholly owned subsidiaries, making partnerships necessary. 
 Is it cost-effective to build it? 
 In other situations, it may be that building it is not something that’s cost-effective to do. To give an example, creating a machine translation program from scratch is likely not a good idea for a startup when there are several vendors in the space. 
 If it’s not an activity that’s core to the company’s value proposition and a third-party vendor can do the work for a reasonable fee, building the capability would also not make sense. 
 Is it a core value proposition that the startup should really own? 
 If the company lacks a capability but it makes strategic sense to develop it, the team will likely have to employ a more transitionary approach by supplementing the firm’s capabilities in the short run, with a view to build it themselves in the future. 
 Terms founders should be setting 
 While it’s very easy to focus on what the market wants from a company, CEOs shouldn’t ignore the things they also need to have in place to make entry worthwhile and effective. 
 Key among these can be illustrated by looking at unit economics. The new challenge here is that customer lifetime value (LTV) is not the same across markets. Because different go-to-market strategies have very different customer acquisition costs, leaders need to monitor this closely. 
 For instance, if a company’s price point, retention numbers, or margins vary across markets, it may not be profitable for it to copy and paste its existing playbook. Particularly in Southeast Asia, there’s a large spread of LTV numbers across different markets. 
   ﻿  ﻿   
   ﻿   
 This can be a huge pothole for startups: The relentless chase for revenue and customers often means they enter new markets by scaling up their existing operating systems rather adapting to the new environment. This will sting in the long run, especially if they’re trying to bring a playbook for a developed market into an emerging territory. 
 In the chart below, it’s evident that while it might be worthwhile to acquire Singaporean consumers through paid ads, it’s a losing strategy in most other markets. Likewise, in the business-to-business context, employing sales reps would be a good use of your company’s scarce resources in more developed areas like Singapore and Taiwan, but not in Cambodia. 
   
 These numbers will move around over time, especially in fast-growing countries like Indonesia or Vietnam. That’s why it’s important for founders to take a forward-looking perspective and examine factors like anticipated GDP growth or inflation when assessing their go-to-market strategy. This will help them form an opinion on future LTV, as opposed to what it is currently. 
 Choosing which markets to enter is essential and gets a lot of attention in management meetings and elsewhere. However, deciding how to do it gets less attention, though it’s every bit as important. 
 While the temptation to copy and paste existing user acquisition and retention models when scaling is huge, making changes is the best way to ensure sustainable unit economics in the long run. 
 Implications for Southeast Asian startups 
 As emerging markets increasingly account for a larger share of the pie, replicating approaches will leave a ton of lost opportunities on the table. 
   
 In places like North America or Europe, the market will impose a lot of things, with its various languages, regulatory requirements, and other demands, on companies looking to scale there. However, it’s rarer for companies to have to employ a fundamentally different customer acquisition strategy across markets in the geography. 
 Managing this diversity is part of the challenge (and fun) of expanding in Southeast Asia, and overcoming it will create an unparalleled competitive advantage for a startup.

653533,"Sendo says merger not a ‘must-have,’ looks to start series D fundraising"," Vietnamese ecommerce marketplace Sendo said it’s looking to start raising series D funds to capitalize on the country’s fast-growing ecommerce sector, adding that a consolidation is not a “must-have” at this point, its chief financial officer JJ Ang told  Tech in Asia . 
 
  Sendo CFO JJ Ang /Photo credit: Sendo 
 
 “Sendo is definitely a believer in industry consolidation but under the right circumstances and the right terms,” Ang said. “There needs to be a very strong alignment on business values as well as execution strategies. Like Indonesia and even Singapore, Vietnam market is significant and large enough to accommodate several key ecommerce players.” 
 Alongside Tiki, Sendo is one of the top-funded homegrown ecommerce players in Vietnam, raising a total of US$112 million to date. The ecommerce firm, a spin-off from Vietnamese IT company FPT Corporation, tries to differentiate itself by tapping consumers beyond Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. 
 Rumors about its potential merger with domestic rival Tiki have been circulating this year, but the talks  reportedly fell through ,  DealStreetAsia  recently reported.  Tech in Asia  also  dived deep  into how a potential deal between the two local powerhouses could shake up Vietnam’s US$35 billion ecommerce sector. 
 Ang, however, believes that Sendo’s performance metrics – such as organic traffic, conversion rate, and users’ purchase frequency – are very sustainable and “favorable compared with other competitors,” but declined to elaborate further. 
 He argues that Sendo can play to its home advantage of being able to leverage the consumer-to-consumer model very early on, but acknowledges fierce competition in Vietnam from the likes of Shopee and Lazada. 
 According to Ang, Sendo’s existing investors also put in more money in an extended series C round this March, following its US$61 million  series C  raise announced in November 2019. He also said the company is looking for long-term investors who can add strategic values in areas such as ecommerce retail or fintech. 
 Ang said Sendo can hit profitability in the next two or three years. When asked about a potential exit for new investors, he said that “can also be in the form of an IPO in the coming years.” 
 Sendo claims that it has more than 500,000 sellers on its platform and serves 12 million customers across all of Vietnam’s 63 provinces. ",Thu Huong Le,0,2,"[(0, 0.8890174), (1, 0.11076021)]","['Sendo', 'Shopee']","['Hanoi', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'Sendo', 'Lazada', 'Vietnam', 'Indonesia']"
653507,Uber to keep its regional headquarters in Singapore," US-based ride-hailing giant Uber said it will keep its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore until at least December 2022. The statement comes two months after it announced that it was  shutting down  its office in the city-state amid Covid-19.

 In May, the company said it would  relocate its Asia Pacific hub to Hong Kong  if the government there provides a regulatory framework that would legalize its operations in the country. 
 “Since then, we have seen strong public support for reforms, but not the level of certainty from the government that we need. As we continue those efforts, we have decided to keep Singapore as a regional hub for the medium term,” the company said in a statement. 
 Uber officially launched its service in Hong Kong in 2014, but it’s still deemed illegal for Uber drivers to carry passengers in the city without a hire-car permit. The company has also faced resistance from the local taxi industry. 
 “By no means are we quitting the Hong Kong market. We still need the government to have an open dialog with us,” a source in Uber told  the   South China Morning Post , adding that the government has given the company a “cold shoulder” especially in the past two months. 
 The source also said that Uber will continue to fight to move its regional headquarters to the city in the future. 
 Uber’s decision comes after Beijing introduced a new national security law in Hong Kong, which has stirred concerns that the move might allow the Chinese government to access data and censor content. 
 Short-video app TikTok, operated by China’s ByteDance, has left  Hong Kong  over concerns involving the new security law. Google and Facebook have also suspended processing government requests for user data from the region.

653516,GudangAda lays off 25 employees following series A," GudangAda, a marketplace for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) wholesalers and retailers in Indonesia, has laid off at least 25 of its employees, according to  a LinkedIn post  shared by a human resource staff of the company. GudangAda previously said it has a total of 350 employees. 
 GudangAda says that the staff is no longer with the company, so her post and actions are purely personal and do not represent the firm. 
 The post on LinkedIn contains  a document  with details of the affected employees, including their email addresses, phone numbers, and links to their LinkedIn profiles, to help them find new opportunities. 
 “This period of time is definitely difficult for companies and talents. Unfortunately, GudangAda also needs to let go of several of their tech and product talents,” she wrote in the initial post. 
   
 A GudangAda representative told  Tech in Asia  that the lay off was purely due to individual performance issues, such as performance gap or a skill-set misfit given its current focus. “We view it as normal attrition in a fast-growth company like us,” he said. 
 He assured that the company has reached a peaceful settlement with everyone that was laid off and that the exercise was fully compliant with government regulations. 
 “As we continue to upskill our teams, we [still] have ongoing openings posted for tech, product, salesforce, and more,” the representative said. 
 The development comes after the company recruited former executives at Indonesian fashion app Sorabel and food logisitics startup Stoqo to be its new  vice president of product  and  vice president of engineering , respectively. Both  Sorabel  and  Stoqo  are startups in Alpha JWC Ventures’ portfolio that had been severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Alpha JWC Ventures is also GudangAda’s investor. 
 As recently as last month, the startup was still actively looking for offline salespeople in more than a dozen cities in Indonesia. 
 GudangAda made the headlines earlier this year as it raised  more than US$35 million  over two investment rounds in only two months. It counts prominent investors such as Sequoia India, Pavilion Capital, Alpha JWC Ventures, and Wavemaker Partners as its backers. 
 Despite starting only at the end of 2018, it says it has already  processed US$1 billion in transactions  in the past 12 months, even as the Covid-19 pandemic swept across the country. The company also says that it has acquired 80,000 big retailers and almost all of the FMCG wholesalers – around 20,000 of them – in Indonesia.

 2️⃣ TikTok might get banned in the US, and its investors, including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, are not having it. So the investment firms stepped up with a proposal: Transfer the majority ownership of TikTok to them at a valuated takeover bid of  US$50 billion . That’s 50x of TikTok’s 2020 projected revenue of about US$1 billion. To put that in perspective, the US$33 billion market cap of Snap Inc. is valued at 15x of its projected 2020 revenue. 
 3️⃣ In Thailand, Grab has a new competitor:  ride-hailing firm Bolt . The Estonian company is backed by China’s Didi Chuxing – which is  also a shareholder in Grab  – and is a popular ride-hailing system in Eastern Europe and Africa. 
 4️⃣ The Philippines has  proposed a bill  to tax tech giants like Facebook, Alphabet’s Google and Youtube, and Netflix. This followed similar moves in  India ,  Indonesia , and  Thailand . 
 5️⃣ TikTok is facing Facebook head on — Kevin Mayer, the CEO of TikTok, has written a  blog post  telling Facebook to “bring it on” with its copycat product, Reels, calling out the social media giant as a platform “disguised as patriotism.” What will we see next from this  newly appointed  CEO? 
 6️⃣ The founder of hospitality startup Oyo has launched an  early-stage VC fund  which will focus on growth-stage startups in consumer, technology, and leisure infrastructure sectors. This comes as Oyo conducted  furloughs  and  layoffs  across the globe. 
 
 Going out of fashion 
    
 Indonesian fashion ecommerce startup Sorabel was seeing healthy growth in early 2019. It was even on a path to profitability as its CEO had mentioned. But now, it’s under administration and is looking for a new buyer. How did  it get to this point?  
 
 
 At the drop of a hat , Covid-19 ended its series C round, which the startup was “very close” to wrapping up with some potential China-based investors. The round would have given Sorabel US$30 million in extra capital.  
 
 The cost of being “too lean” : Sorabel never had more than six months of runway since 2016. Without the cash cushion, the startup wasn’t able to pivot as quickly as other players  like Zilingo , which began selling personal protective equipment during the pandemic. 
 
 A hole in the pocket : With Sorabel’s main customers – Indonesia’s middle and lower middle class – reeling from layoffs and furloughs due to the pandemic, it’s website visits had plunged from a peak of over 1.1 million visits in March 2020 to 410,000 by April.

653494,"Line’s delivery app in Thailand banks $110m, merges with local food app"," Thailand’s  Line Man , the on-demand assistant platform of messaging app Line, said it has reached an agreement to receive US$110 million in investment from growth capital firm BRV Capital Management. 
 According to Line, this is the first time one of its entities overseas has secured an investment of this size.

 The deal comes as Line Man inked a merger with Wongnai Media, a restaurant review and discovery platform in Thailand. According to a statement from Line, the capital investment aims to strengthen the newly merged entity and expand its development in the country. 
 Since being founded in 2010, Wongnai currently has more than 10 million monthly users, carrying the largest restaurant database in Thailand with over 400,000 establishments in its network. Line said the merger would help it strengthen its position as the country’s leading daily assistant app. 
 Line Man was  launched  in 2016 as Line forayed into local, on-demand services for the first time. Since then, it has added over 100,000 restaurants to its platform. 
 The app offers deliveries for food, groceries, convenience store items, and parcels, along with messenger and taxi-hailing services. It currently operates in Bangkok and several other provinces such as Nonthaburi, Samutprakran, and Nakornprathom. 
 Jayden Kang, former chief strategy officer at Line Thailand, said in an interview with  Korea Times  last year that the company aims to extend its reach into 17 more regions in the country in the coming years, adding that Line Man would continue to focus on the local market rather than expanding overseas. 
 BRV is a regional growth capital firm that led early rounds in PayPal and Waze. According to the statement, the company decided to invest in Line Man because of the app’s success in becoming a “daily assistant” to local users.

653100,Future Indonesia: The role cloud computing plays in a P2P lending platform,"    
 (Additional reporting by  Nathaniel Fetalvero ) 
 Indonesia’s peer-to-peer (P2P) lending sector is flourishing. According to  research by the Asian Development Bank Institute , the vertical represents 43% of the country’s fintech industry. The growth of P2P lending has led many investors – both from within Indonesia and across Asia – to back various digital lending platforms that have sprung up in recent years. 
 But these online services often face challenges in ensuring that their borrowers have the ability to make good on their loans. 
 Quicker assessment 
 Most P2P lending platforms have risk control measures in place to assess their customers’ credit worthiness. However, these checks need to be performed quickly or companies risk losing business. 
 “We must be able to process [users’ credit scores] very quickly because people expect you to be able to give them loans quickly,” says Felix Suroso, IT and quality assurance manager at P2P lending service DanaRupiah. “If you don’t assess [users’] risks quickly, they’ll go to competitors.”

 To move fast, platforms like DanaRupiah leverage Alibaba Cloud’s machine learning technology. The cloud technology service provider’s servers allow companies to sort and analyze large chunks of data much faster than if they were to perform the tasks manually. 
 “One person will only be able to analyze one [piece of] data in maybe five minutes,” Suroso adds. In comparison, machine learning allows DanaRupiah to analyze 1,000 pieces of data each minute. “That is definitely a huge advantage for us,” he says. 
 Utilizing Alibaba Cloud’s cloud servers also ensures that DanaRupiah’s services are up and running around the clock. This means that even if a transaction were to be made in the middle of the night, it would still go through seamlessly. 
 Processing large amounts of data 
 DanaRupiah is working on expanding its reach to be able to serve more borrowers, from fishermen and farmers to small businesses such as food stalls. However, serving customers from different sectors means the company will have to abide by different regulations for each of the markets it operates in. 
 This is where Alibaba Cloud’s service plays a crucial role in enabling the business, says Suroso. The cloud provider’s data processing server boosts DanaRupiah’s computing capabilities, meaning it can efficiently assess large amounts of data with various factors such as markets and industries borrowers in play. 
 “All this data is very hard to analyze. So we need a really quick cloud computing service to be able to analyze this data to ensure that there’s no human error as well to analyze the credit scoring of our customers in all these different sectors,” Suroso shares. 
 
 This entry is part of the  Future Indonesia  series, which showcases how the digital transformation of Indonesian businesses is enabled by the use of cloud technology.

 Founded in 2014, EMQ provides a fast and affordable cross-border settlement solution for businesses around the world. The company said it built its infrastructure to be easily deployed across multiple industries for a broad range of services, such as ecommerce, merchant settlement, procurement, remittance, and payroll. 
 Currently, EMQ’s network spans across Asia Pacific, Africa, Europe, and North America, with licenses in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Indonesia. The company was also accepted into Taiwan’s regulatory sandbox by the region’s Financial Supervisory Commission. 
  What are its future plans?  Max Liu, co-founder and CEO of EMQ, told  Tech in Asia  that while most of its volume comes from consumer remittances, EMQ is planning to ramp up its business remittances segment globally. 
  See also:  The startup helping Tencent capture a share of Southeast Asia’s remittances market   
 With that, the startup looks to use the new funds to bolster its cross-border solutions and compliance capabilities. 
 “We are onboarding enterprise customers around the world and process cross-border payments across 80 key markets,” Liu said. “We are also focusing on increasing our regulatory footprint in key markets such as the UK, EU, Japan, and Australia.” 
 He also noted that recently, the company has ramped up its network across Asia, Africa, and Europe and is now expanding across the Americas. However, the company expects China and Southeast Asia to be its biggest markets for business transactions. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Since it’s series A raise in 2017, the company has been focused on building up its financial settlement infrastructure to support a wide range of front-end use cases. 
 With that in place, EMQ has rolled out an enterprise payment solution with same-day settlement capabilities across its key markets. “We have seen a healthy ramp-up on these services, [and we] expect this to contribute to 50% of our gross transaction value in 2021,” Liu said. 
 EMQ has also increased its licenses from two to five. It was able to bump up its payout capability from four markets to over 80, and saw its historical trailing annual transaction volume increase by 70x. 
 The head chief also said it has significantly strengthened its coverage in China to over 130 banks, further increasing its capabilities in business remittances. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  Like many startups, the company’s fundraising plans was also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. But Liu said that the company’s “Covid-19-resistant” traction, as well as the global need for a fintech infrastructure, helped it secure series B funding. 
 “With the acceleration in digital payments across the world in part due to Covid-19, enterprises will need network infrastructure like EMQ to streamline the complexities in processing real-time international payments across multiple jurisdictions,” the head chief said.

653451,Oyo founder Ritesh Agarwal to invest up to $5m in startups via new fund,"  Oyo  founder and CEO Ritesh Agarwal has set up a new VC firm to invest in growth-stage businesses in the consumer, technology, and leisure infrastructure sectors.

 His company, called Aroa Ventures, will focus on startups with proven unit economics, a year-on-year growth rate of 20%, and US$1 million to US$10 million in annual revenue, according to its  website . The VC firm looks to invest between US$500,000 and US$5 million into each startup that meets the criteria. 
 “We believe that the long-term environment will always be favorable for making value-added investments in companies with proven unit economics and high potential to scale,” the company said. 
 In addition to funding, Aroa Ventures also aims to seek partnerships with entrepreneurs to help build long-lasting businesses and connect them to its network. Its team will work alongside portfolio companies to expedite their growth and help them generate larger returns. 
 Acting as the head of Aroa Ventures is Gaurav Gulati, who helped found Innov8 Coworking and acted as its chief operating officer. The SoftBank-backed Oyo acquired Innov8 last year for roughly US$30 million. Prior to that, Gulati had co-founded Purist Meals, which was then acquired by fitness and well-being startup Cure.Fit. 
  Tech in Asia  has reached out to Aroa Ventures for further details. 
 The development was first reported by  Entrackr,  citing filings. It said that Aroa Ventures was registered last year with Agarwal and Thomas Hufnagel, a partner at the law firm that handled the registration, as the company’s two shareholders. 
 Aroa Ventures is sponsored by Agarwal’s RACo Holding Company, with Agarwal controlling 100% stake in the investment firm, the report said. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(2, 0.99941146)]","['Agarwal', 'VC', 'Oyo', 'OYO', 'SoftBank']",['Asia']
653437,Telio founder is accused of breaching fiduciary duty by his previous startup. He denies the claims,"  Terence Lee and Thu Huong Le co-reported for this story.  
 Sy Phong Bui, founder and CEO of  Telio , a business-to-business ecommerce marketplace in Vietnam that enables small retailers to procure goods from its web and mobile apps, is embroiled in an ongoing legal dispute with his former startup, according to two sources familiar with the matter and several internal documents seen by  Tech in Asia . 
 The year-long legal spat pits Bui against his previous startup, OnOnPay. The fintech company’s board has accused him of breaching his fiduciary duties as its director by usurping its business opportunities and using its resources to develop Telio.

 At the same time, Bui did not grant OnOnPay’s investors shares in the new startup despite supposedly saying that he would do so. 
 Bui’s lawyers have denied OnOnPay’s allegations, adding that it has no legal basis to claim any share in Telio. 
 “I am compliant with applicable laws,” said Bui in an email statement to  Tech in Asia.  However, he declined to comment on specific details as the lawsuit is ongoing. 
 Telio’s complicated birth 
 On his Linkedin profile, Bui indicated that he had left OnOnPay in November 2018. But before that, he attended Alibaba’s eFounders Fellowship and drew inspiration for Telio at that leadership program. 
 In January 2019, Telio’s legal entity was set up in Singapore, according to a public filing, and it quickly became one of the most prominent young startups from Vietnam. 
 But OnOnPay’s directors insist that there wasn’t a clean break between his two stints. They claim to have consented to Telio’s development using OnOnPay’s resources, including its “employees, technology, know-how” as well as database of customers and merchants. Telio’s trial run was conducted on OnOnPay’s website. 
 The directors cited an expense report for OnOnPay sent by the chief operating officer, noting that the company had started to “run the wholesale reseller [business] since November 2018, which incurred the promotion cost to motivate merchants to use the product.” 
 Around the time Bui set up the new entity, he explained to OnOnPay’s shareholders that its purpose was to help him fundraise for Telio since the valuation for OnOnPay had “caused hesitation for the round to be closed,” Bui wrote in an email seen by  Tech in Asia.  
 He envisioned that the new company would “empower 1.5 million mom and pop shops in Vietnam” and said that Telio had been launched in the “recent” 1.5 months. “The new entity’s cap table shall fully reflect OnOnPay’s current one, with a lower valuation as the investment into Telio is considered as seed funding,” he added. 
 Those shares never came, according to internal documents seen by us. 
 A public filing obtained by  Tech in Asia  in July 2020 shows that none of OnOnPay’s investors appear to be shareholders in Telio. 
 The next hot ticket 
 As 2019 wore on, Bui’s new startup began to attract interest: Telio became part of the  first batch  of companies at Surge, the accelerator program of venture capital firm Sequoia. 
 But talks between OnOnPay and Bui became a public disagreement. Captii Limited, the parent company of Captii Ventures – one of OnOnPay’s investors – published a  notice  dated September 6, saying that its board of directors had agreed to take legal action against Bui and Telio. 
 Accordingly, the case was filed between OOPA Pte Ltd, the holding company for OnOnPay’s Vietnam entity, against Bui in the High Court of Singapore on the same date that the note was released. OnOnPay demanded 100% of the shares in Telio’s Singapore entity. 
 “In initiating legal action, OOPA is taking steps to protect the company’s interests and ultimately those of its creditors and shareholders,” wrote Sai Kit Ng, Captii Ventures’ Southeast Asia head, in an email to  Tech in Asia.  Ng is also a director at OOPA. 
 Regardless, Telio’s fundraising continued unabated. Three months later, it bagged a  US$25 million series A round  led by Tiger Global, with participation from Sequoia India, GGV Capital, and RTP Global. Its valuation soared to US$100 million, according to an internal email, making it one of the most notable deals in Vietnam’s startup tech ecosystem last year. 
 As Telio’s new investors conducted due diligence, it’s unclear how much they knew about the legal conflict.  Tech in Asia  sought comment from two investors, but they declined. 
 Meanwhile, Telio was removed as a party to the lawsuit in April this year, leaving its founder as the sole defendant. 
 According to Ng, the move was done with the pledge that Telio would “take all necessary steps to abide by all rulings of the court” involving Bui. 
 Bui says that “there was no reason or basis to involve Telio or any of Telio’s investors” in the lawsuit.

 Bui is a familiar face in Vietnam’s tech ecosystem. He founded OnOnPay in 2014 as a mobile wallet and phone top-up startup to capitalize on the country’s smartphone boom. OnOnPay allowed users to top up their phones conveniently from mobile carriers in Vietnam in exchange for attractive offers like coupons or gift certificates. 
 OnOnPay went on to raise several rounds of funding, including a  seed round  from Captii Ventures in August 2015, a  pre-Series A  round led by Gobi Partners in November 2016 and  an investment  from Pegasus Tech Ventures in June 2018. 
 OnOnPay, however, would hit a major roadblock toward the end of 2018 after it failed to secure an e-wallet license from the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), according to sources. OnOnPay is not on the  list  of all 35 non-bank institutions that have been licensed by SBV to provide payment intermediary service since 2015. 
 Bui’s rebuttal and settlement offer 
 In a September 2019 letter, Bui’s lawyers denied that their client had breached his fiduciary duties, saying that OnOnPay investors were not interested in funding Telio “due to differences on valuation and terms.” They also pointed out that “OnOnPay clearly did not have the financial wherewithal” to invest in Telio. 
 Captii’s Ng tells  Tech in Asia  that it’s false that OnOnPay’s investors weren’t keen to back Telio. 
 Bui’s lawyers then posited that OnOnPay’s board of directors were aware that “Telio was incorporated and fully owned” by their client. Furthermore, OnOnPay was used for the “ulterior purpose of bringing illegitimate pressure against” Bui, and that “improper resolutions” were passed so that the fintech firm could enter into a loan agreement with its investors at an “excessive” interest rate of 24%.

 “There are no reasonable or probable grounds for the relevant directors to believe the [OnOnPay] will be able to repay the debt,” the letter said. The lawyers then denied that OnOnPay resources were used to develop Telio. 
 Ng disagrees that “improper resolutions” were passed. “All OOPA’s business decisions, including the said loan to OOPA signed in 2019, were made during board meetings that were properly held with resolutions passed by directors in accordance with the constitution of OOPA and the law,” he says. 
 In June 2020, Bui made a settlement offer to OnOnPay investors, but they rejected it, according to a source aware of the talks. 
 In an email seen by  Tech in Asia , Bui offered either US$600,000 in cash or his own non-voting Telio shares worth US$500,000 at a post-series A valuation of US$100 million. 
 One of the sources says that the investors turned down the offer because they’ve put in a lot more money – US$2.3 million to be exact – in OnOnPay. The investors had also claimed 100% of the shares in Telio Lte Ltd, according to a court document dated January 2020. 
 Bui retained investors’ support and goodwill even when OnOnPay didn’t get the SBV license and ran out of cash, given that “it’s normal for entrepreneurs to pivot” business models when things don’t work out, the source adds. The investors even recommended and helped Bui to attend the eFounders program. 
 Ng declined to comment on the settlement offer because the lawsuit is ongoing. According to Bui, “the parties are heading to mediation soon.” 
 Gobi Partners, whose vice-president Kenneth Tan is an OnOnPay director, said in a statement to  Tech in Asia  that it would like to highlight the “importance of integrity and follow through on what is just and fair to all parties involved” as well as the “importance of corporate governance and duties of a startup founder.” 
 Preferred outcome 
 In such legal disputes, mediation or an out-of-court settlement is often the best outcome for both parties, according to a Singapore-based dispute resolution lawyer who opted to remain anonymous. 
 Either option would save on legal fees, and a voluntary settlement also reduces uncertainty. 
 “Singapore courts are aggressive about promoting mediation. They will send a letter to both parties’ lawyers to encourage them” to take up that option, the lawyer says. Refusing it could have an impact on costs to be awarded, as determined by the judge. 
 An out-of-court settlement may be preferable, anyway, because in assessing remedies, judges tend to favor awarding monetary compensation over a transfer of assets. 
 Also, without an existing contract obligation, the court can’t order or enforce non-compete or employment agreements between two parties, for example. 
 “With mediation, parties can agree to whatever they want. Courts can only go so far in terms of reliefs that they can order,” the lawyer explains. That said, a judge may order an asset to be transferred if it  isn’t easily replaceable by cash  – stocks in a private company may fall under this category. 
 If they do decide to leave it up to the judge, then a few factors will come into play. 
 Accountants will tell you that everything can be assessed. 
 Because of what’s called a “proper plaintiff rule,” a firm’s shareholders generally cannot go after an alleged wrongdoer for losses to the firm. As such, damages are assessed based on the losses to the company and not the shareholders, on the basis that the shareholders’ losses reflect the company’s losses. 
 Also, in cases where one party is claiming assets from another party, the judge must be convinced that both sides had entered into a contractual agreement to do so. 
 Unlike a signed contract, “it’s not as clear if an exchange of emails is enforceable,” the lawyer notes. “Was there an offer? Was there an unconditional acceptance? Are the terms certain and complete enough? Is the promise enforceable?” 
 Finally, determining the compensation for a lost business opportunity can be tricky, which is why experts can be brought in to help put a dollar value on it. 
 “Accountants will tell you that everything can be assessed with the right methods and assumptions,” the lawyer says.

 Earlier this year, Singapore’s Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said the country aims to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles and “have vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040.” Tesla entering Singapore would help the country reach this goal faster, as it already has a number of road-ready vehicles for sale. 
 In the past, however, Musk said that the Singapore government was unsupportive of electric vehicles. In an interview with  Bloomberg  last year, the city-state’s minister for water and environment resources Masagos Zulkifli dismissed the remark, saying that what the EV giant really wants to produce is a “lifestyle.” 
 “We are not interested in a lifestyle. We are interested in proper solutions that will address climate problems,” he said.

653356,Is Indonesia in for an e-gold rush?,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Hello readers, 
 Indonesia has struck gold – but not the kind many of us are used to. In fact, it exists as a bunch of pixels on our phone screens, until we cash it out or ask for it to be delivered to our doorsteps. That’s right, we’re talking about digital gold. 
 What’s more? The country’s most prolific unicorns are offering Indonesians a way to invest in the precious metal for as low as 100 rupiah (US$0.0069) and every single one of Indonesia’s 82 million mobile phone users counts as a potential investor. 
 Scroll down for a quick summary or  read the full story here . 
  Here are your quick bytes for today:  
 1️⃣ Ride-hailing major  Grab  has submitted a proposal to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore to  introduce a S$0.32 platform fee  to all transport rides in the city-state. If approved, Grab says it will reinvest the money into the safety and security of its rides service. 
 2️⃣ Instagram is  offering financial incentives  to TikTok users with millions of followers to persuade them to use Reels, a new competing service that Facebook Inc. is launching next month. The potential payments for some would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
 3️⃣ Chinese online travel giant Ctrip is in talks with potential investors about  funding its delisting from Nasdaq  because of rising US-China tensions and the coronavirus-driven hit to its business. Back in February, Jane Sun, CEO of the Trip.com Group, which also owns Ctrip,  told   Tech in Asia  that she believed “demand [for] travel will come up again after the outbreak is over.” 
 4️⃣ Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing is  hitting a road bump in Japan . It will have to cut back on operations due to stiff regulations in the country that have also affected other Chinese sharing services. The situation is rosier back in China, however. In May, Didi president Jean Liu shared that its “ core business is profitable .” 
 5️⃣ Tencent, Sogou’s biggest shareholder, has made a preliminary US$2.1 billion offer to buy out China’s second largest online search engine.  The acquisition could help  Tencent compete against Bytedance’s Toutiao Search and China’s largest search engine Baidu. 
 6️⃣ Huawei has  slashed its India revenue target  for 2020 by up to 50% and is laying off 60% to 70% of its staff, excluding those in research and development and the Global Service Centre. The move comes as the company battles plunging demand for its equipment and services amid border hostilities between China and India. 
 
 There’s digital gold in these hills 
    
 Optimists are saying that Indonesia could be on the verge of an e-gold rush as tech startups are  democratizing gold investment  across the country by offering easy access to trades at affordable rates via mobile apps. 
 
 
 Everyone’s an investor : As most digital gold can be bought with a tap on a mobile app, anyone from Indonesia’s 82 million mobile phone users could become a potential investor. 
 
 More players, more profit : While gold isn’t as large as other commodities in terms of the total available market, it still commands massive amounts of attention –  it has 100x more online investors than silver or palladium. 
 
 Sitting on a goldmine :  Tech in Asia  estimates that the size of Indonesia’s potential available gold market could amount to some US$12.6 billion. Bukalapak foresees gold-based digital investment to contribute “at least 10% to 20%” of the total gold traded in Indonesia. 
 
 A new startup battlefront : With an opportunity as large as this, it’s no wonder that Gojek and Tokopedia have hopped on the trend to command their share of the market. They recently tacked on bullion as the first investment function on their apps. 
 
 Not all that glitters is gold : This massive growth isn’t a given though, as there may be cultural or structural reasons preventing Indonesians from investing in more gold.

 As an online travel agency, Traveloka was badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. But the startup is seeing recovery in key markets recently, and has  raised US$250 million  from a global financial institution to strengthen its balance sheet and boost efforts to deepen its offerings in select priority areas. 
 
 
 Historic drop in business : The company saw daily requests for refunds and booking rescheduling increase by as much as 10x since February. It was also reported that the company cut 100 employees or 10% of its workforce in April amid the pandemic. 
 
 Flight path to recovery : However, it’s seeing “encouraging recovery” across all of its key markets in domestic, short-distance travel, and activities bookings. Its business in Vietnam, for example, is approaching pre-Covid-19 levels, while its Thailand unit is on its way to surpass 50%. 
 
 Slow, but steady : Although Indonesia and Malaysia are still in the early stage of recovery, Traveloka said they are making week-to-week improvement, especially in the accommodation segment, as demand for shorter-distance staycation emerges.

653317,Behind Sorabel’s shutdown: could it have been avoided?," Sorabel had been on the right track. The Indonesian fashion ecommerce startup was seeing healthy growth after a  rebrand  in early 2019 and was on a path to profitability, says co-founder and recently resigned CEO Jeffrey Yuwono. 
 It just needed to raise money first via a series C round targeted for US$30 million from mostly Chinese investors, with plans to close by April 2020.

 Then Covid-19 happened. Sorabel’s investors, facing uncertainty as well as travel restrictions in China and Indonesia, dropped out. Meanwhile, its customers had to tighten their belts as they dealt with furloughs and job cuts. 
 Like many other startups and tech companies, Covid-19 exposed Sorabel’s key liability: a short financial runway. It wasn’t sufficient enough to make it through the pandemic or even to pivot into short-term strategies. It also told employees  last week  that it would not be able to pay salaries beyond this month. 
 Now, about six years after its founding, the company is under administration as it searches for a potential buyer. 
 Less-than-ideal timing 
 Sorabel had started out as Sale Stock, which was established by husband-and-wife team Lingga Madu and Ariza Novianti to sell affordable clothes to Indonesia’s middle-low segment. Unlike marketplaces Zalora and Berrybenka, Sale Stock adopted a “private label” approach. While this involved extra costs, it also gave the business better margins and the ability to quickly meet consumer trends. 
 The company raised US$27 million in series B funding in 2017 from high-profile investors, including Alpha JWC Ventures and Gobi Partners, along with Indonesian conglomerates Sinar Mas (through its venture capital arm, SMDV) and MNC Media. 
 Two undisclosed bridge rounds followed in 2019. According to  ACRA  filings for Sale Stock’s Singapore entity, the company has a total of US$69 million in paid-up capital. 
 Yuwono joined as president in 2016, became an official co-founder, and eventually took over the CEO helm in 2018. At the center of his strategy was the company’s rebrand from Sale Stock to Sorabel, which happened in early 2019. 
 Sorabel was not yet profitable, though it had gross margins of 58%. 
 The name change heralded its transition from a “low-cost fashion provider” – as implied by the word “sale” in the name – into an “up-to-date, risk-free shopping” place, Yuwono  said at the time . While revenue had initially fallen, he said that it rebounded within a few months, and Sorabel was back on track towards the end of 2019. 
 “We grew really quickly over the year,” Yuwono tells  Tech in Asia . “We grew revenue by 2.4x, and the awareness for the Sorabel rebrand started to accelerate in Q4 2019.” 
 Along with “double-digit” growth by the fourth quarter of 2019, the company was also CM3 positive, says Kevin Widlansky, Sorabel’s chief financial officer. CM stands for  contribution margin , which measures revenue on a gross or per-unit basis after deducting variable costs. CM3 refers to the contribution margin after deducting variable costs including marketing expenses. 
 “What that tells you is that we were selling goods more efficiently at lower marketing spend,” the CFO points out.

 Sorabel, however, was not yet profitable, though Yuwono  claimed  that it had gross margins of 58%. The company was targeting profitability by Q1 2021, which required it to focus on a “much leaner and more flexible” supply chain, according to Widlansky. 
 To do this, Sorabel also needed to secure its series C round. The team was confident that it could leverage on the momentum to raise additional money, and they were “very close” to doing just that, Yuwono says. 
 Sorabel had spoken to plenty of investors, primarily China-based ones, Widlansky says. Some of the talks had progressed to advanced stages when the Covid-19 pandemic derailed those plans. 
 “We had potential investors close to closing, but in the end, they pulled out,” he explains. “It was hard to blame them. It was a very uncertain time.” 
 Even before Indonesia itself started to close its borders and instituted large-scale social restrictions, Covid-19 was already spreading in China in January 2020. The resulting lockdown meant that interested investors were unable to fly into Jakarta. 
 Sorabel’s “very lean” runway didn’t help matters. 
 Potential backers found it hard to commit to the US$30 million round “without being able to visit onsite and conduct due diligence,” Yuwono observes. “It was really disheartening when those funds disappeared. We went from meeting 10 investors weekly to literally zero overnight.” 
 Sorabel’s ‘very lean’ runway didn’t help matters. 
 “Since 2016, we’ve never had more than six months of runway,” Yuwono says. “This provided good discipline in that we had to always be ultra-focused on making improvements to merit more new funds. However, the margin of error was so small and certainly not enough to survive the force majeure of a global pandemic.” 
 The ex-CEO says that Sale Stock was founded with a fast-growth mindset. When he joined four years ago, the company tried to combine growth with better unit economics. Contribution margins improved by 6x while the burn rate was reduced, but even then, they were still unprofitable. 
 The company had become too bloated, having laid off over 100 employees in 2016. Yuwono says that the infrastructure had expanded to meet its rapid early growth, but he concedes that they probably didn’t need so many offices or people. 
 “As long as growth remained rapid and capital remained inexpensive, such a strategy made sense,” he says. That growth assumption started to falter in 2016, which ultimately led to the rebrand. 
 Falling revenues 
 Covid-19 also left Sorabel’s main customers – Indonesia’s the middle and lower-middle classes – reeling from layoffs both temporary and permanent. With fashion being a “discretionary” segment – it’s more of a luxury compared to, say, consumer goods – sales across the industry dropped as disposable incomes shrank. 
 At Sorabel, items such as homewear or pajamas did better, but the company’s bread-and-butter categories of blouses and dresses saw a “big decline,” Yuwono says. “People aren’t going out to meet friends or go shopping. There’s less need [for] fashion.” 
 Indeed, Sorabel’s estimated website visits fell from April 2020 onwards, according to SimilarWeb. After a peak of 1.15 million visits in March 2020, the number plunged to 410,000 by April and has since stayed below the 500,000 mark. 
 Covid-19 also wreaked havoc on Sorabel’s sales during Hari Raya, which is traditionally when Muslim Indonesians would purchase new clothes as part of the festivities. Based on third-party estimates, Sorabel’s number of active app users typically reaches its yearly peak around the holiday, which usually falls between May and June.

 With the pandemic, that was no longer the case. 
 Not only did Covid-19 affect overall demand, but it also constrained Sorabel’s ability to restock, Widlansky notes. “We couldn’t get new stock out to sell. Demand was weak, and that ripped our runway,” he says, calling the situation a “double whammy.” 
 In the early days of the health crisis, Sorabel did reduce its burn rate through furloughs and unpaid leaves. It had also pivoted to producing masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals, as other fashion tech companies like Zilingo have done, but it got similarly mixed results. While the masks were selling well, with the first batch selling out in seven hours, “there’s only so much margin that you can generate,” Widlansky says. 
 He adds that PPE was a “potential game changer” because of higher prices and margins, but the buyer Sorabel had lined up was a large medical institution in the midwestern US. This became a non-starter when Indonesia put in place regulations that  temporarily prohibited  exports of masks and PPE. 
 Ultimately, Sorabel abandoned the PPE project as it was unable to find domestic buyers, either. A more significant pivot, perhaps to categories outside fashion, might have been possible, if it weren’t for Sorabel’s tight cash reserves. 
 The way forward 
 Yuwono, who served as CEO for about two years, tendered his resignation in June, though he’s staying on to help with the transition. 
 “I think Covid-19 was pretty demoralizing, and I started to question whether I was the right leader for Sorabel going forward,” he shares. 
 Original founders Madu and Novianti left the company late last year. Madu declined  Tech in Asia ’s request for comment on this story. 
 According to Yuwono and Widlansky, the best outcome would be for another company to take over the Sorabel brand. That would ensure employment for at least part of their staff, which numbered nearly 400 at last count. 
 “There’s nothing wrong with the company. It was doing really well,” Yuwono explains, citing a sell-through rate of 70% after 30 days and defect rates of less than 2%, which he says is “amazing” for a fashion business. 
 “If another company doesn’t pick it up and bring it forward, it just seems like such a waste,” he adds. “But it does seem like there are companies out there who recognize that value.” 
 Without talking specifics, Widlansky says they’re seeing “significant” interest from potential buyers, largely because of the brand’s strength with the customer base. If no buyer comes forth, Sorabel would most likely enter liquidation. 
 Yuwono says fashion operators would make the most sense as buyers, as they understand the industry as well as the value of Sorabel’s infrastructure. But he also emphasizes that at this point, that choice would be under the purview of administrators, and management would not have authority to decide.

 Still, there might have been room for the company to have avoided this outcome altogether. Both Yuwono and Widlansky agree that doing the pivot sooner could have made a world of difference. 
 That could have happened as soon as the moment he joined in 2016, Yuwono adds. Sale Stock’s marketing team believed that rebranding was necessary, but the company prioritized improving margins, fixing product quality, and revamping logistics. 
 “The main reason is that rebranding is capital-intensive and difficult, while we had high-growth targets and limited funds,” Yuwono says. “Would I have had the credibility to make such a change? That is a harder question to answer.” 
 “I liken it a lot to 2008 in the automotive industry,” says Widlansky, who started his career at General Motors. The US carmaker filed for bankruptcy amid the 2008 global financial crisis, while rival Ford  avoided the same fate , partly because it had locked down financing prior to the crisis. Like General Motors, Sorabel was trying to refinance when Covid-19 broke out, he adds. 
 Sorabel’s burn rate could have been handled better as well. Yuwono recalls that when he joined, the company slashed its burn rate by 60%, which “felt like a lot at the time, but in retrospect, it probably wasn’t enough.” 
 “We could’ve really tried to raise more money ahead of making big changes” instead of after things were set in motion, he observes.

 With a current market value of  US$16.4 billion , Ctrip, which is operated by the Trip.com Group, has reached out to private equity firms and domestic tech companies to join a take-private deal, said sources with direct knowledge of the matter. 
 The development comes as the pandemic has negatively affected Ctrip’s business. 
 In March, the company  announced  that it would suspend operations and terminate employment contracts. It also reported a  US$754 million net loss  and a 42% decrease in net revenue in Q1 2020, compared with the same period last year. It’s expecting to see a 67% to 77% year-on-year decrease in net revenue in Q2 2020.

 The report comes at a time when US-listed Chinese companies are facing tighter regulations following the  Luckin Coffee fiasco . 
 On Monday, Chinese tech giant Tencent made a  preliminary offer  to take Sogou, the country’s second-biggest search engine, private. Tencent is the biggest shareholder in Sogou, whose parent company Sohu is listed on Nasdaq.

 If you spat out your morning cuppa when you first heard the news that Chinese coffee chain Luckin Coffee was being investigated for fraud, you’re not alone. 
 The news that about US$300 million in revenue and around US$190 million in cost and expenses were fabricated in 2019 was shocking, but in retrospect, there were numerous red flags surrounding the company’s growth. 
 Scroll down for a short summary or  click here for the full story (🔒). 
  But first, here are your quick bytes for today:  
 1️⃣ Gojek’s super app ambitions are getting bigger: The ride-hailing giant has  filed several fresh trademark applications  in Indonesia. Among these is GoTransit, a public transit mapping service. 
 The company had previously filed trademarks for services related to video conference streaming, financial management, and even electronics repairs. Last month, Gojek announced that it raised additional capital from  Facebook and PayPal  (🔒) as well as existing backers Google and Tencent. 
 2️⃣ Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) has overtaken ExxonMobil to become the  world’s second-largest energy company , expanding RIL managing director Mukesh Ambani’s  kingdom (🔒) even further. 
 The company’s digital arm, Jio Platforms, recently  wrapped up its fundraising spree (🔒) at over US$20 billion. 
 3️⃣ Forty-seven more Chinese apps  have been banned  in India amid border tensions between the two countries. And the list could grow – an additional 275 apps  may be blacklisted , including mobile game  PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds  – more commonly known as PUBG – and music-streaming app Resso. 
 This comes after  the Indian government blocked access to 59 Chinese apps  late last month, with TikTok, WeChat, and Shareit among the casualties. 
 4️⃣ Li Auto Inc., a Meituan Dianping-backed manufacturer of electric vehicles in China, has  launched an initial public offering  of up to US$950 million. 
 Its rival, Xpeng Motors,  recently raised US$500 million  in a Series C+ funding round. Sources close to the matter say it’s looking to go public in New York later this year. 
 5️⃣ Chinese startup Red Date wants to make the process of creating blockchain-based apps  quick, cheap, and easy . Through the use of a Blockchain-based Service Network that supports a variety of software and platforms, the company is hoping to unify the fragmented blockchain industry. 
 6️⃣ Grofers, an Indian e-grocery startup backed by SoftBank, is looking to  launch an initial public offering next year . The company, which has seen its path to profitability accelerate as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, initially planned on making its stock market debut in 2022.

 In the aftermath of the Luckin Coffee fiasco, there are  some lessons to be learned  (🔒) about due diligence and keeping an eye out for red flags. 
 
 
 Fast and furious : Luckin’s strategy relied heavily on cash-burning promotion tactics. However, such strategies aren’t sustainable in the long run, and the coffee chain’s extravagant market spending and user retention issues had caught media attention before. 
 
 Speaking untruths : Many products that Luckin claimed were major growth drivers were not big sellers – if they were present in stores at all. 
 
 Flash backward : A look at previous startups led by Luckin founder Charles Lu should have set off alarm bells. Poor investment decisions and unwise spending were among the problems these firms faced. 
 
 Checks and balances : The corporate governance standards of Chinese businesses have long been a cause for concern. Additionally, requirements for Chinese companies to list in the US have been relaxed, making it easier for things to slip past the radar. 
 
 Rose-tinted glasses : Investors are often under pressure to rush into deals that look promising, and warning signs may be ignored in pursuit of the next big success.

 From people-movers to grocery delivery 
 
  Illustration: Maria Chimishkyan 
 
 Covid-19 has had a pretty severe impact on ride-hailing businesses, which is why Burmese startup Oway has  turned to the online grocery space . 
 
 
 Founded in 2012 , Oway started off as a travel booking platform before entering the ride-hailing space in 2015. 
 
 Lockdown measures  imposed across several townships in Myanmar have “completely decimated” the ride-hailing and travel sectors in the country, says Oway CEO Alok Kumar. 
 
 Oway Fresh , the company’s online marketplace, is an end-to-end ecommerce service that manages delivery, sourcing, quality control, and packaging. It delivers fruit, vegetables and meat, as well as products like personal care items and cleaning supplies. 
 
 With gross margins currently in the double digits,  Oway Fresh is helping the company stay afloat in the crisis, although the real challenge will be in sustaining its growth post-pandemic.

653263,Grab looks to charge a platform fee for all rides in Singapore," Ride-hailing major  Grab  said it has submitted a proposal to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) to introduce a S$0.32 platform fee to all transport rides in the city-state. 
 
  Photo credit: Grab 
 
 If approved, Grab will reinvest the money from the platform fee into the safety and security of their rides service. This includes maintaining and improving its app’s current features and rolling out new ones. 
 One such initiative is GrabProtect, which was launched to help curb the spread of Covid-19 by implementing features and various safety measures to keep driver-partners and passengers safe. 
 The CCCS said in a media release that it’s inviting public feedback on Grab’s proposal from now until August 11. 
  Tech in Asia  has reached out to Grab to learn more about the proposed platform fee. 
 On September 2018, the government agency issued an infringement decision against Grab and Uber in relation to their merger, which the CCCS said had led to a “substantial lessening of competition.” As part of this, Grab was prohibited from changing its pre-transaction pricing without gaining approval from the competition watchdog. 
 In its latest application, however, Grab said that implementing the fee is aligned with ride-hailing industry norm. The company also noted that the fee will enable the startup to maintain and enhance the various safety measures while covering the relevant operating costs. 
 “A third of the funds collected through the platform fee will be committed towards providing benefits for driver welfare,” Grab said in its application. 
 Some additional enhancements Grab aims to put in place following CCCS approval include doubling the personal accident insurance for both rider and driver from US$10,000 to US$20,000, as well as rolling out additional training for driver-partners to improve safety, among others.

653199,Ex-Honestbee boss gets real estate giant’s backing for new app in the Philippines," Imagine opening a single app to find and order everything you need from food to hardware products, pay for them in a single check-out process, and get the items delivered to your doorstep. This is the kind of customer experience that  Pickaroo , a new app being launched today in the Philippines, wants to offer via an “all-in-one” delivery platform. 
 “I think what’s very common is that, normally, you have a separate food app and you have a separate delivery app for groceries,” Crystal Gonzalez, CEO and co-founder of Pickaroo, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 
  Photo credit: Pickaroo 
 
 Gonzalez used to lead the Philippine operations of the Singapore-headquartered grocery delivery app Honestbee, which closed down last year amid  financial and management setbacks . 
 With the lessons learned from her experience at Honestbee, she’s now developing her own take at a delivery service that is customized for the Philippines. She has also roped in former Honestbee employees to lead Pickaroo’s operations, business development, categories, and expansion. 
 The startup has won backing from one of the country’s top conglomerates. 
 Conglomerate backing 
 Pickaroo raised its first US$5 million in investment from Agile Digital Ventures, the technology and digital investment arm of Philippine real estate conglomerate Megaworld Corporation, which not only develops residential properties but also operates malls, office spaces, and hotels. 
 Kevin Tan, the president and founder of the VC firm, is also a co-founder at Pickaroo, which is Agile’s first startup investment. He’s the son of Philippine business tycoon Andrew Tan, the chairman and founder of Megaworld. 
 Gonzalez discloses that she serves as chief operating officer and a board member at Agile as well, with a stake in the company. 
 “With what happened with Honestbee, I feel more secure and sustainable to have an established local investment partner [for Pickaroo],” says Gonzalez. 
 She says that the collaboration will enable the two entities to empower offline retailers in the Philippines that are struggling to go online amid the Covid-19 pandemic. By combining Tan’s real estate and retail expertise with Pickaroo’s tech capabilities, the duo aims to help SMEs and malls – even those not owned or operated by Megaworld – become successful in ecommerce. 
 Startup-corporate collaborations like this are usually deemed  challenging  as two companies may not always have similar approaches to risk, growth, and resources. But this perception seems to be slowly changing. 
 In the Philippines, conglomerates have already  invested  huge sums of money in tech companies as well as other digital ventures. A notable one would be the US$40 million poured by JG Summit – a conglomerate with interests in retail, real estate, telco, and air transportation, among others – into Sea Group, which operates gaming major Garena and regional ecommerce player Shopee. 
 And as Covid-19 hit, SM Investments Corporation, one of the biggest mall chain operators in the country, started boosting its ecommerce efforts to reach its customers. It also  plans  to participate in the grocery delivery space in the future. 
 For Pickaroo, Gonzalez describes its collaboration with Megaworld as having a “perfect balance. I feel it’s like the best of both worlds when we combine, because even if they have their corporate conditions, they allow the team to really operate as a startup.” She adds that her startup has a separate team, office, HR team, and bank account. 
 Meanwhile, Tan, who largely works with corporations, is willing to learn from startups and contribute insights from the corporate world. Gonzalez says, “I think it’s something he really wanted to make sure of, because he knew that if we were embedded in a corporate setting, we wouldn’t flourish.” 
 Following her experience at Honestbee, Gonzalez also shares that she wants to work with someone who has experience running “a successful, profitable, sustainable business.” She puts emphasis on transparency, which she says is important in developing synergy between investors and a startup’s management team. 
 Regarding this, Gonzalez says she and Tan “both don’t like beating around the bush.” 
 A local advantage 
 With such a strong conglomerate backing, Gonzalez is ready to open Pickaroo to more consumers by August. She says the platform’s key advantage is its ability to address local needs and adapt to local culture. 
 “This time, we’re able to localize everything,” she says. Compared to Honestbee, Pickaroo includes more local brands, with its management team, employees, and investors all Filipinos. It also takes into account the country’s digital infrastructure and consumer behavior. 
 “For example, here [in the Philippines], cash is king,” Gonzalez says, adding that the archipelago has one of the lowest credit card penetration rates in Asia at less than 10%. She notes that some foreign players fail to recognize this and therefore struggle to offer seamless cash payment options to their users. 
 With Pickaroo, customers may choose to pay with cash upon delivery or through credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallet, powered by local digital payments enabler PayMaya.

 Pickaroo charges a revenue share or commission from its partners, a shopper fee, and a delivery fee. On top of these, it plans to add other revenue streams through partnerships and marketing. 
 For now, it focuses on fulfilling deliveries in key cities in Metro Manila with the help of its 100 staff and riders who are independent contractors. 
 Its platform, which currently sees 1,500 shoppers, has onboarded over 300 local and global brands, covering gourmet hotel food and Michelin-star restaurants as well as daily essentials like groceries, medicine, and home and kitchen supplies, among others. 
 Some of its partners include Central by Landers Supermarket, Sheraton Manila, Paradise Dynasty, Mothercare, and MedExpress. 
 Pickaroo aims to be profitable within the first year of its operations. It didn’t give specific targets, but its CEO says the potential opportunity and revenue can definitely be “a lot more than Honestbee’s [were].” 
 “We are not competing with valuation,” Gonzalez says. “I think there’s been this unfortunate culture […] in the startup world, which is about valuation and just growth. Growth is good, but it has to be realistic and sustainable.” 
 For Pickaroo, Gonzalez cares more about acquiring the right customers and improving its product and services to achieve profitability and sustainability. For the rest of the year, the startup will focus on ramping up its penetration and coverage across the country. 
 However, it’ll be up against some big names. Grab, for one, is doubling down on its GrabMart service. Regional ecommerce players Shopee and Lazada have also started offering daily essentials with Shopee Mart and Lazmart, respectively. 
 Gonzalez, however, thinks that Pickaroo’s market advantage is its homegrown status, which comes with better knowledge and understanding of the local culture. “The care will never be the same unless it’s [from] your own.” ",Doris Yu,2,5,"[(0, 0.016302356), (1, 0.617275), (2, 0.10755022), (3, 0.25887242)]","['MedExpress', 'VC', 'app', 'Pickaroo', 'Megaworld', 'Shopee', 'GrabMart', 'Central']","['Singapore', 'Asia', 'Agile', 'Pickaroo', 'Philippines', 'Lazada', 'Mothercare', 'Michelin']"
653211,StashAway gears up for expansion after raising $16m," Singapore-based robo-advisor  StashAway  said it has raised US$16 million in a series C round led by Australian VC major Square Peg. 
 Hubert Burda Media’s growth capital arm Burda Principal Investments and existing investor Eight Roads Ventures also participated in the round, according to a statement.

 Founded in 2016, StashAway is a digital wealth management platform that offers investment and cash management portfolios for both retail and accredited investors. Its technology provides automated and personalized portfolio management, targeting different levels of risk. 
 As of the end of June this year, StashAway claims its portfolios have generated annualized returns ranging from 11.6% for its highest-risk portfolio and 4.9% for its lowest-risk portfolio since it launched in July 2017. 
 The startup also has its own financial education program called StashAway Academy. It has licenses from the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Securities Commission Malaysia, the two countries it currently operates in. 
  What are its future plans?  According to StashAway co-founder and CEO Michele Ferrario, the startup plans to use the new funds to speed up product development and enhance the capabilities of its platform. 
 While declining to disclose any specific features the startup would work on, Ferrario told  Tech in Asia  that StashAway looks to carry on the momentum it has gained over the past year to integrate new investment products and features to its app. 
 In addition, the CEO said that the startup has a few country launches in the pipeline as of now, but did not share any specific locations. 
 Helping with these plans is Square Peg partner Tushar Roy, who joins StashAway’s board as part of the funding deal. “The team is now 85 people-strong across five countries, and they’ve been clearly attracting top-tier talent to drive the company and product forward,” he said. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Since StashAway’s series B raise in 2019, it has launched a Singapore dollar income portfolio in the city-state, as well as its cash management portfolio StashAway Simple in Malaysia and Singapore. 
 To carry this momentum forward, the company said it’s still actively hiring, despite the market uncertainties. “We currently have 32 open positions in Singapore, Malaysia, UAE, Hong Kong, and Thailand,” Ferrario said. 
 The startup also strengthened its educational efforts over the past year, launching its StashAway Academy program in the mobile app and launching the podcast  In Your Best Interest . 
 The company claims that more than 20,000 people have watched its seminars and webinars on personal and investing topics. It has also seen its assets under management grow 4.3x in the past 12 months. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  Ferrario shared that March was a challenging month for the company given the financial impacts Covid-19 brought worldwide. 
 “However, most of our clients continued to dollar-cost-average into the markets, sticking to their plans and following best practices for long-term wealth building,” he noted. As a result, the company said it saw growth during the first half of the year. 
  What is the company’s funding history?  All in all, the company said it has now raised S$50.7 million (US$36.8 million) in paid-up capital. Here are its previous funding rounds: 
 
 
 Series B  (2019): US$12 million from lead investor Eight Roads Ventures and Asia Capital and Advisors 
 
 Series A  (2018): US$5.3 million from lead investor Asia Capital &amp; Advisors and other undisclosed investors 
 
 Pre-series A  (2017): US$2.2 million from lead investor Asia Capital &amp; Advisors and other undisclosed investors 
 
 Seed  (2016): US$516,200 from the founders and other undisclosed investors

653249,Alibaba’s map app AutoNavi wants to revive the umbrella sharing economy," The Alibaba-owned map app  AutoNavi  is bringing umbrella sharing back to China. And the service comes at no extra cost to users of the app’s ride-hailing service.

 Umbrellas were briefly one of the hot items that became part of China’s sharing economy craze over the last several years. Bike-sharing pioneers Ofo and Mobike would become some of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend until the bubble popped. It got to a point where smartphone users could rent out seemingly anything, from power banks to entire kitchens. 
  See also:  Shared powerbanks: A billion-dollar opportunity or fool’s gold?   
 But the umbrella trend didn’t last. One Chinese company reported that it lost most of its 300,000 umbrellas mere weeks into its rental operation. And so ended plans to make shared umbrellas the next hot thing in China’s sharing economy – until now. 
 AutoNavi announced on its Weibo account on Sunday that its first batch of shared umbrellas are now available in select cities across the country. In case of sudden showers, users of the platform’s ride-hailing service will be able to get an umbrella from their drivers for free. 
 While AutoNavi told users to return the umbrellas the next time they take a ride, it did not explain how it aims to retrieve them from forgetful passengers or thieves. The scheme, which involves a partnership with weather.com.cn, will also include shared raincoats at two shopping center chains in Beijing.

653237,Traveloka bags $250m as it recovers from Covid-19," Indonesian travel unicorn Traveloka today announced it has raised US$250 million in a funding round led by a global financial institution, along with existing investors. 
 The new capital injection is expected to further strengthen Traveloka’s balance sheet and boost efforts to deepen its offerings in select priority areas, including building a travel and lifestyle portfolio in key markets as well as expanding its financial services solutions, according to a statement.

 The company said it has witnessed a “historic drop” in business activity as Covid-19 severely hit the travel and tourism sectors, significantly disrupting businesses for its partners. 
 “Without a doubt, Traveloka has been profoundly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. We have experienced the lowest business rate that we have ever seen since our inception,” said Ferry Unardi, co-founder and CEO of Traveloka. 
 The company saw daily requests for refunds and booking rescheduling  increase by as much as 10x  since February. It was also reported that the company cut  100 employees , or 10% of its workforce, in April amid the pandemic. 
 In May, the company’s strategic partner Airy, an aggregator of budget hotels in Indonesia,  shut down  due to “a significant technical decline and a reduction in human resources.” 
 “The travel industry is facing unprecedented times, including Traveloka. The leadership team has taken difficult yet commendable measures, including restructuring and optimization, to minimize financial health risks,” Willson Cuaca, managing partner of EV Growth, said. 
 Traveloka, however, said it’s seeing “encouraging recovery” across all of its key markets in domestic, short-distance travel, and activities bookings. Its business in Vietnam, for example, is approaching pre-Covid-19 levels, while its Thailand unit is on its way to surpass 50%. 
 Although Indonesia and Malaysia are still in the early stage of recovery, Traveloka said they are making week-to-week improvement, especially in the accommodation segment, as demand for shorter-distance staycation emerges. 
 “We acknowledge that the sector may go through further turbulence as it navigates new waves, but we feel we are prepared to take on the challenge and emerge on the right side of it,” Unardi said. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(1, 0.9995077)]",[],"['Vietnam', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia']"
653013,3 ways startups can become ‘business intelligent’," Data is a  vital asset  for companies and plays a key role in many decision-making processes. 
 Case in point, a survey conducted by Forrester Consulting this year found that data-driven firms are  58% more likely to achieve revenue goals  and 162% more likely to surpass those goals significantly, as opposed to their less data-savvy peers. 
 It’s obvious then that the ability to use data effectively can go a long way in driving an organization’s growth. The key to doing this: implementing business intelligence processes. 
 Empowering workers with business intelligence 
 Business intelligence, at a very broad level, refers to the use of software and services to turn data into actionable insights to drive decision-making in a company. 
 “It enables business people to access data without having to write code and allows users to interact with data to drive business performance,” says Cindi Howson, chief data strategy officer at business intelligence analytics provider  ThoughtSpot . 
 According to Howson, implementing such strategies helps drive performance across all aspects of business, such as through increasing revenue, boosting operational efficiency, understanding employee performance, and managing inventory.

 Traditionally, business intelligence was squarely in the domain of analysts. However, modern approaches to the strategy empower people across all levels of an organization to use data to do their jobs more effectively. 
 A recent report produced by the  Harvard Business Review  in partnership with ThoughtSpot found that the new decision-makers in a company  are actually frontline workers , such as nurses, salespeople, and bank tellers. A positive customer experience is often dependent on these people, as they are a customer’s first point of contact with a business. 
 According to the report, 87% of business executives surveyed felt that organizations would be more successful if frontline workers were empowered to use data to make decisions in the moment – something that business intelligence tools could be particularly helpful with. 
 For example, a financial advisor at a bank who has access to insights on spending habits and credit histories could provide more helpful and targeted guidance to clients. 
 Given the impact that using data can have on operations, it’s no wonder many companies are looking to implement business intelligence strategies into their processes. Here are three tips from Howson on how startups can do this successfully. 
 1. Understand what you need data for 
 This seems like a no-brainer, but it’s important to know what you want to do using data. Many business intelligence projects fail because companies try to implement them  without a clear strategy  in place and don’t have a concrete idea of what they want data to help them accomplish. 
 Startups need to ask themselves some questions: How can data help improve the business? What are the highest value use cases? What are the business outcomes that the company wants to measure and improve? 
 For Howson, companies need to have answers to these questions before they even begin looking into business intelligence tools and software. 
 “Think about the use cases with the most business value. For example, if you’re in the finance space, things like credit risk and customer loyalty are important use cases where business intelligence can help,” she says. 
 2. Have the right data strategy in place 
 Having decided on the relevant use cases, companies then need to implement the right data strategy – that is to figure out how to go about collecting, using, storing, and integrating data into the firm. .

 While this may seem simple, poor data collection methods often  lead to low-quality data , which in turn affects the kinds of insights a company is able to glean. 
 In order to develop a good data strategy, there are three components businesses need to keep in mind: what the data is meant for, how it is collected and stored, and how it will eventually be used and accessed. 
 Businesses also need to ensure that they adhere to regulations around data protection so they can safeguard the privacy of their customers and workers. 
 3. Create a data-driven culture 
 Lastly, startups need to make using data a key component of how they work, ensuring that data drives their decision-making and  features as an important part  in their processes. 
 One way to do this, according to Howson, is to “make data part of your product.” It’s a strategy that ThoughtSpot applies in its own operations – the company uses MixPanel, a product analytics program, to understand which of its features customers use the most and to figure out which aspects of their platform could be improved on. 
 That said, companies may face the challenge of convincing employees to take the leap. Despite the benefits of using data, many workers are  afraid of it , and poor data literacy skills mean that many of them  don’t know  how to use data effectively to drive their work. 
 Businesses can tackle this problem in various ways. Leaders, for one, need to ensure that they work with staff across all levels when developing and implementing business intelligence strategies and that they  lead by example , using data to back their decisions. 
 Companies can also upskill their workers through data literacy courses and workshops, as well as tap into the variety of business intelligence tools that make using data less daunting. ThoughtSpot’s platform, for instance, enables users to derive new insights from data through a Google-like search interface that makes accessing such information straightforward and simple. 
 Driven by data 
 Business intelligence, and how it helps companies utilize data effectively, has an important role to play in driving the growth of a company. 
 Leaders need to work together with their teams to develop comprehensive business intelligence strategies that serve a purpose and help leverage data to deliver tangible benefits to the business. 
 As long as companies keep sight of what they want to achieve with data and have a clear strategy in place, becoming “business intelligent” will go a long way in empowering workers and driving better decisions in an organization. 
 
 ThoughtSpot is a business intelligence and big data analytics platform that helps you explore, analyze, and share real-time business analytics data easily.

653157,Letter to readers: Can Mitra Bukalapak woo skeptical FMCG giants?," Dear readers, 
 We’ve been keeping an eye on Southeast Asia’s business-to-business ecommerce market, which has seen a dramatic uptick in venture capital money in recent years. 
 Last week, our Indonesia reporter Putra Muskita uncovered a  roadblock faced by Mitra Bukalapak , ecommerce unicorn Bukalapak’s attempt to take on the market.

While the move might sound unusual, it’s not that far-fetched as airlines are already more multifaceted than people might think. In reality, they’re a transportation, logistics, food and beverage, media, and retail business rolled into one. 
 For AirAsia to even have a chance to achieve this feat though, it needs to solve its cashflow woes first as it climbs out of the pandemic.

 Speaking of super apps, a reader  noted  that any contender that doesn’t include a popular chat feature as a trigger won’t work, with WeChat being an example. 
 While I agree that it is a key cog, we’re also seeing how other super apps that don’t have chat, like Meituan-Dianping and Alipay, are succeeding in China. 
 The main ingredient, I think, is encouraging high-frequency transactions and interactions that form the basis for everything else. Chat is certainly a big one (and this makes Whatsapp aspirations intriguing), but who’s to say ecommerce and food delivery can’t form the basis for a super app? 
 Finally, analyst Vincent Fernando circles back to ecommerce by looking at how  a boom in online FMCG shopping  is brewing. It’s already seeing massive investments in China, and Southeast Asia could very well follow suit.

653161,"Why are Gojek, Bukalapak, and Tokopedia gunning for digital gold?"," Jakarta-based journalist Nabila Marsya takes 500,000 Indonesian rupiah (US$34) from her salary every month to invest in gold, she tells  Tech in Asia . What’s uncanny about the gold that the 28-year-old owns is that she’ll probably never see or touch it. That’s because it’s being managed by local ecommerce giant Bukalapak, which launched its  digital gold-buying feature , BukaEmas, in September 2019. 
 By offering a nearly negligible entry point – investments on BukaEmas start from 100 rupiah (US$0.0068) – Bukalapak is trying to woo casual investors exactly like Marsya. The company also makes investing in the precious metal almost as fuss free as ordering a snack from its main app.

 “With BukaEmas, we hope that people from various walks of life can have fair access to transact gold at a very affordable amount,” says Intan Wibisono, head of corporate communications at Bukalapak. 
 The company’s Mitra Tabungan Emas service – an expansion of BukaEmas – even allows people to start gold investment from the closest  warung  (small traditional stalls) from as low as 10,000 rupiah, he says. 
 In comparison, buying gold offline requires a minimum investment of around 500,000 rupiah (US$34.19) in exchange for a 0.5g gold bar – the tiniest size available on the market. However, few dealers offer this size, meaning minimum prices for offline investments are often even higher. 
 Apart from the high cost of initial investment, buying and keeping physical gold has also  gone out of style  for many reasons, such as the risk of keeping the precious metal without a safe deposit box. Storing large amounts of bullion can also incur hefty storage fees. 
 Optimists believe Indonesia could be on the verge of an e-gold rush, despite the country’s gold consumption lagging significantly behind China and India. 
 “Indonesia’s demand per capita is still at 0.2g per annum, which provides opportunity for growth,” says digital microsavings startup Treasury.id, which recently added gold to its list of financial products. 
    
    
 Indeed,  Tech in Asia  estimates that the size of Indonesia’s potential available gold market could amount to some US$12.6 billion – over three times of what it was worth in 2019 – when benchmarked against China’s more mature market. Bukalapak tells  Tech in Asia  that it foresees gold-based digital investment to contribute “at least 10% to 20%” of the total gold trade volume in Indonesia. 
 As most digital gold can be bought with a tap on a mobile app, any single one of Indonesia’s  82 million mobile phone users  could become a potential investor. 
 This massive growth isn’t a given though, as there may be cultural or structural reasons preventing Indonesians from investing in more gold. Overcoming such barriers won’t be easy, but a way forward could be to bundle gold into a basket of investment products. The precious metal, like other assets, is just one of many means to attain financial freedom after all. 
 Traditional gold industry players stand to make a lot of money in transitioning to online modes, but they could gain a new and more youthful audience by partnering with internet companies like Tokopedia and Gojek instead. These tech platforms, meanwhile, may only make a small cut from gold investing, but it could become a significant use case for their e-wallets. 
 Going for gold 
 While gold isn’t as large as other investment products in terms of the total available market, it still commands massive amounts of attention, with “100 times more” online investors in the space compared to other commodities, such as silver or palladium, says microsavings startup Pluang. 
 With an opportunity as large as this, it’s no wonder that Indonesia’s app giants like Gojek and Tokopedia are locking horns in a race to command their share of the market. Many of these firms have already tacked on bullion as the first investment function on their desktop and mobile apps.

 Gojek, for one, picked gold as the first asset for its investment services arm, GoInvestasi, because it’s preferred by Indonesians for “its long-term stability and relatively lower risk profile,” says Budi Gandasoebrata, managing director of GoPay. GoPay is used for transactions such as those on GoInvestasi. 
 The super app silently rolled out the feature in May in partnership with Pluang, which is backed by the ride-hailing firm’s venture capital arm, GoVentures. 
 Through GoInvestasi, Gojek is positioning its e-gold offering as a form of savings, with transactions starting from as little as 0.01g of gold – equivalent to approximately 8,000 rupiah (US$0.55). With the feature, users can purchase digital gold in just three simple steps: selecting the quantity, confirming the transaction, and paying via GoPay. 
    
 Gojek isn’t the first to offer this, however. It follows in the footsteps of competitor Tokopedia, which was one of the first unicorns to diversify into gold investment products with Tokopedia Emas in early 2018. Having been on the block for a few years, Tokopedia tells  Tech in Asia  that digital gold is on an uptrend. 
 “We’ve continuously seen an increase in Indonesian’s enthusiasm for online gold commodities since launching. Tokopedia Emas’ transactions surged more than 3.5 times during Q2 2020, compared to the same period in 2019,” says Vira Widiyasari, vice president of fintech and payment at Tokopedia. 
 Fintech platform KoinWorks, meanwhile, also created KoinGold, its first investment product outside of its usual peer-to-peer offerings. It sold over 1 billion rupiah (US$68,700) of gold within two weeks of launching the beta version of its gold-dealing feature. 
 “We added KoinGold to our product mix to better serve our mostly millennial retail clients,” says KoinWorks CFO Mark Bruny. “Any situation where clients can have easier access to suitable investments is a good situation.” 
 Our main objective is to democratize gold. 
 There’s also been a bevy of boutique startups that either specialize in gold investment or have widened their offerings to include the precious metal. 
 Treasury.id is one of them. “Our main objective is to democratize gold,” says Narantara Sitepu, the company’s head of brand development. “We do this by providing a very accessible price point for purchasing gold. Our users can buy starting from IDR 5,000 (US$0.34) – a price point that was not available before we came into the market in November 2018.” 
 Marsya, the Jakarta-based journalist who invests in digital gold, shares that she would never have imagined herself purchasing the precious metal monthly as a child. “I just know gold could be pawned or sold when you needed money,” she says. But since buying her first gram in 2016, she now checks on her portfolio’s yield daily. 
 For her, it’s not surprising that many players are jumping on the e-gold bandwagon, as buying in gold is the “most familiar [sort of investment] for Indonesians.” 
 Younger people, she says, tend to be attracted to these digital startups, as they offer affordable starting prices. Like many young people, Marsya has an aversion to buying physical gold offline, saying that although some startups give the option of “withdrawing” gold and having it delivered, she wouldn’t do so. 
 For many older Indonesians, though, physical gold is synonymous with wealth and savings. Regardless, KoinWorks found that over 60% of people in the archipelago prefer gold as an investment, as it has been used for generations, with traditions stipulating that gold be part of a wedding dowry. 
 Apart from this, gold is also Shariah friendly, which means it’s compliant with Islamic rules – a big deal in the Muslim-majority country.

 New internet platforms, however, face an issue: They’re perceived as untrustworthy. Maizal Walfajri, who lives in West Java, sets aside 500,000 rupiah (US$34) per month for digital gold investments. But his choice of platform is the one provided by national pawnshop giant PT Pegadaian, rather than the ones offered by mega ecommerce startups like Gojek, Bukalapak, or Tokopedia. He has been using the program since July 2018. 
 Like many industries in the country, incumbents have a strong grip on the market. “I chose PT Pegadaian, as it’s a state-owned enterprise,” says Walfajri. “I’ve previously used gold trader Indogold, but as I didn’t trust them, I moved all of my investments to Pegadaian.” 
 The 28-year-old, who calls himself a “traditional customer,” says he used to enjoy his monthly walks to the nearest PT Pegadaian branch to top up his gold portfolio monthly. But with Covid-19, he says he’s been forced to change his habits. He now uses Pegadaian Digital to manage his investments, which include several other mutual funds and stocks. 
 Buying a grain of gold costs the same as my daily lunch 
 It’s not just the millennials who are swerving on tradition. Sri Utami Sumarno, a 42-year-old Surabaya businessperson, says – while showing a picture of several of her gold necklaces – that she would “definitely dabble” in e-gold if startups can prove their mettle. 
 “It just feels odd pushing a button on your smartphone to buy gold. We can’t even feel it,” she says. “But since buying a grain of gold costs the same as my daily lunch, I guess there’s no harm giving digital gold a shot.” 
 According to a 2019 survey by Financial Services Authority, over three-quarters of Indonesians use financial products and services, but just a third of them consider themselves “financially literate.” It’s this gap in literacy that all the startups are after. 
 “There is a huge potential for industry players, including those from the technology sector, to participate in increasing the nation’s financial literacy and inclusion,” says Tokopedia’s Widiyasari. “While Indonesian people’s financial literacy has risen significantly, we believe there is still a massive potential for gold investment’s part in increasing that further.” 
 How does it work? 
 Besides the minimum transaction value, buying digital gold is just like shopping for groceries or making a purchase online. 
 Buying e-gold – although done digitally – still means users purchase physical portions of the precious metal. The physical gold that users buy is held in the custody of the issuer until users choose to sell or have the gold delivered. That being said, while some services give the option of having the gold delivered to doorsteps, others only allow users to redeem the gold by selling it back to the vendor at specific prices.

 In the market, symbiotic relationships are emerging between ecommerce companies and entities that store and provide gold. Through partnerships, PT Pegadaian, for example, is gaining access to the millions of daily users on Tokopedia and Bukalapak as it tries to shed its image as a pawnshop and move into digital services. 
 In Gojek’s case, it also works with PT Kliring Berjangka Indonesia, a state-owned clearing house that serves as a custodian for the gold bought on the super app’s platform. When customers buy gold on GoInvestasi, for instance, the money is transferred from Pluang’s segregated account to the clearing house, which then guarantees the physical gold itself. 
 For Bukalapak, it relies on gold trader Indogold – which also allows users to invest in bullion – and teams up with state-owned mining and metals company PT Anam for storage. The company’s BukaEmas feature offers cash and installment payment options, and the gold that users purchase will then be stored at PT Anam’s virtual boxes. Users may withdraw the gold they have deposited once it has grown to at least half a gram. 
 Tokopedia, meanwhile, is working with online jewelry sales firm Orori for its Tokopedia Emas platform, while Treasury.id partners with Indonesia’s largest private gold refinery, UBS Surabaya, and Indonesia Clearing House. Koinworks, on the other hand, teams up with several gold aggregators – companies that collect and resell gold from mines. 
 How much can you gain from gold? 
 Gold is a safe haven asset, meaning more people invest in it during economic hardship. It comes as no surprise then that gold prices in Indonesia have risen 26.3% since the start of the year. 
    
 Despite being an investment product, gold has an inverse relationship with the stock market, as many investors buy more of it to “safeguard” their portfolios during times of political and economic uncertainty. 
 There’s been even more demand lately, with many economies teetering on the brink of recessions from Covid-19. In the early days of the pandemic, some traders even compared the frenzied buying of gold to  that of toilet paper . 
 According to Treasury.id’s Sitepu, gold stands out when compared to other commodities. Even amid the turmoil this year, it’s the “leading asset” with returns of 24% within six months. Contrast this to crude oil which dipped to a negative price for the first time in history in April this year, and it’s a much safer bet. “Our focus now is to offer gold as an instrument to save,” he says. 
 However, Pluang co-founder Claudia Kolonas cautions that digital gold is profitable, it’s a “medium-term product” that shouldn’t be used for short-term trading.

 A common consensus on the market is that gold as an asset is “virtually permanent,” with no erosion of quality over time, says KoinWorks’ Bruny. 
 “Gold has both an essential industrial use in electronics and commercially in jewelry. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has none of these features,” he says, emphasizing that the e-gold trend wouldn’t be a flash in the pan unlike the cryptocurrency craze in 2017. “Gold will never go out of style.” 
 Even so, because tech unicorns occupy only the tail end of the gold investment value chain, they may find limited direct revenue opportunities. In fact, it may be the existing industry players, who own the customer base and infrastructure, that may stand to gain the most. 
 For internet platforms, digital gold may be a means to another end: increasing the number of use cases for their e-wallets. 
 After all, the more money a user transacts on the platform, the more insights the platform has on that person. The real gold here isn’t the metal but the data.

653117,Lessons from the Luckin fiasco," Luckin Coffee was hailed as a success story last year when the Chinese startup debuted on Nasdaq. The company was a  growth miracle : Founded in October 2017, it reached the coveted unicorn status in less than a year and went public in just 17 months. In China, Luckin was the only homegrown coffee chain to challenge the longstanding dominance of US giant Starbucks. 
 In hindsight, Luckin’s success story was too good to be true. Investors can be blinded by the lure of rapid growth among Chinese startups, observers tell  Tech in Asia . It eventually emerged that Luckin was operating on an unsustainable cash-burning business model and  overstating its sales figures . 
 In China’s hyper-competitive business culture, tech startups are pushed to expand with a “grow-at-all-cost” mindset. But when that drive is coupled with weak corporate governance, it can lead to trouble.

 The man behind Luckin and the mastermind behind the sales fraud was  Charles Lu Zhenghao , who is known for practicing high-pressure growth tactics at his companies. In retrospect, Luckin’s fast growth and initial public offering likely led to shortcuts in the due diligence process. 
 While doing deep due diligence is costly, it’s an important step in evaluating speculative high-growth companies like Luckin. After all, the real victims when things blow up are retail investors who are vulnerable to risks rather than venture capital firms that can sell their stakes in a company much earlier to avoid losses. 
 Fall from grace 
 Investment due diligence firm  Muddy Waters Research  received an  anonymous report  in February alleging that Luckin Coffee’s sales figures were exaggerated. 
 In early July, Luckin completed its  independent internal probe  into the sales fraud. It found that a group of employees began creating fake sales transactions in April 2019 – a month before the company made its Nasdaq debut. As a result, its 2019 numbers were inflated: revenue by US$300 million while its costs and expenses by US$190 million. 
 One of the ways the company cooked the books was by recording sales of vouchers that could be exchanged for cups of coffee. Some of these vouchers were purchased by individual accounts, but vouchers redeemable for tens of millions of cups of coffee were  sold  to companies linked to Lu, who was then co-founder and chairman of Luckin, according to a  Wall Street Journal  report that cited internal documents and public records. 
 
  A timeline of key events leading up to Luckin’s sales fraud 
 
 Before the scandal, Luckin was the darling of capital markets. It opened more than a thousand stores within the first few months of its existence, setting up in office buildings, school campuses, and central commercial areas across major cities in China. 
 Lu was regarded as a serial entrepreneur who controlled two other public companies in China: Hong Kong-listed vehicle rental service Car Inc. and ride-hailing startup UCar, which was listed on The New Third Board. 
 Given these favorable odds, what could go wrong? 
 Plenty, apparently, if one heeded the warning signs. 
 Red flags 
 The company relied on cash-burning promotion tactics that turned out to be unsustainable in the long run. 
 It’s no secret that the Luckin brand was built around giving out free drinks and discount vouchers. Relying heavily on promotions like “buy 10 and get 10 free” and price cuts that went as steep as 92%, Luckin was able to quickly build a large pool of users. 
 Known as “fission marketing,” this strategy focuses on building up internet traffic through attractive promotional deals and rewards to encourage consumption and new referrals. Luckin chief marketing officer Yang Fei calls it a key “growth hacking technique,” one that was also used by UCar. Yang favors this approach so much that he even published a  book  in Chinese about it. 
  In 2015, Yang was    sentenced    to 18 months in jail for violating Chinese advertising law at iWOM, a marketing startup he co-founded. Soon after his release, Yang was named the CMO of UCar.  
 Luckin was doing whatever it could to achieve fast growth. The company revealed that it burned through  US$150 million dollars  in the first six months of operations. A big chunk of that money went to paying for vouchers of free or discounted drinks while another part went into offline expansion. 
 In less than three years, the Xiamen-based chain claimed to have opened 4,500 operational coffee shops – or more than four stores in one day. 
 The reason these types of fraud occur is that trust is built on the back of friendly relationships. 
 To support these cash-burning efforts, Luckin needed to swiftly get investments. Prior to going public, the startup – then in its third year – raised US$550 million from four funding rounds and secured another US$645 million from the IPO. 
 Leading up to the IPO, Luckin was involved in transactions including an  enormous margin loan  taken out by Lu, according to Matthew Graham, CEO of fintech investment firm Sino Global Capital.  Margin loans  allow you to borrow money to invest in approved shares or managed funds. Transactions like this tend to be a significant red flag, especially in conjunction with an IPO in the US. Relative to the size of Lu’s holdings as Luckin’s then-chairman, the loan amount was sizable. This didn’t seem like the behavior of someone who believes in the company’s long-term prospects. 
 On top of that, Luckin’s business model and strategy didn’t make sense and seem sustainable, notes Graham. Heavy discounting and “buying” customers wouldn’t work if a company doesn’t focus on keeping them once the discounts end. Luckin’ extravagant  marketing spending  and  user retention problems  have drawn media attention before.

 Graham also observed that around the neighborhood of his office building in West Beijing, where Luckin stores are densely distributed, none of the shops were working at or near capacity. 
 In a Twitter  post  last April, Graham wrote: “Luckin Coffee will collapse. I’m calling it. Three years tops.” 
 Similarly, China Market Research Group (CMR) director Ben Cavender tells  Tech in Asia  that when his firm conducted store checks on Luckin for a client last year, it found that many of the products that Luckin had credited for its growth weren’t big sellers or present at many locations. In fact, several shops didn’t record any sales of non-coffee beverages or food items, despite the startup’s claim that some of these products were major growth drivers, said Cavender. 
 The Luckin team, namely the recently ousted Charles Lu and a handful of top-level management staff, also set off warning bells, given that many of them were implicated in or removed from their roles because of the sales scandal. 
 Investors would have been wise to look closely at the startups that they previously ran as this likely would have led to increased scrutiny of Luckin’s numbers and operating model. 
 UCar, for example, didn’t have the best track record even before the Luckin fiasco. Though it employs aggressive pricing strategies, it remains unprofitable and has shriveling revenues. 
 
  Luckin’s management team, explained 
 
 Lu’s career history should have also sounded the alarm. Before his big break with Car Inc, he founded UAA (Joint Automobile Club) in 2005, which provided car service, repairs, and insurance. With a business model largely inspired by US-based insurance firm AAA, the club received an initial investment from tech firm Lenovo. 
 Though UAA offered insurance products at prices below its competitors’, they had limited coverage and the quality was poor. UAA simply couldn’t compete with local providers in China and the club couldn’t figure out a way to retain customers. Still, Lu squandered  tens of millions of yuan  on advertising and promotional efforts in Beijing alone. 
 UCar’s finances were similarly unhealthy before Luckin’s fraud even came to light, says Kuang Yuming, founder of Lens Company Research, an agency that focuses on Chinese public companies. Under Lu, the loss-making UCar spent US$614 million to  acquire  a controlling stake in embattled German automaker Borgward in early 2019. The company racked up hefty losses under its previous owner Foton. In the first eight months of 2018, Borgward lost around US$228 million after losing US$384 million in the year prior, according to information disclosed by Foton. 
   
 It was not a strategic move, but the deal helped Lu tell a more convincing story of success. UCar could have used this cash to bail itself out of the crisis instead, notes Kuang. 
 Founded in 2015, UCar is Car Inc.’s subsidiary-turned-parent. But while Car Inc. is currently profitable, UCar has been losing money. According to UCar’s  financial report  for the first half of 2019, revenue dropped nearly 49% to US$273.71 million compared to the same period in the previous year, with a net loss of US$92.9 million. 
 A disintegrating business empire 
 On the surface, UCar and Luckin operate independently. But according to industry watchers, Lu treats these companies more as personal fiefdoms than corporate entities. This means that when one’s in trouble, the others are likely to suffer from the fallout. 
 Car Inc. took a hit in April when its stock price tumbled 72% due to its ties with Luckin. During the same period, UCar suspended its shares for a month. The company is likely going to be delisted after missing the June 30 deadline for filing its annual financial report, which is required for all companies listed on the Nasdaq-like New Third Board. 
 Even though these entities are technically separate, the lines are blurred. For instance, an employee could be working on projects for Luckin and Car Inc. at the same time. 
 According to Chinese media, whenever Lu starts a venture, he often disproportionately allocates workforce and resources from existing entities into his new business, raising questions of conflicts of interest. 
 For example, when UCar acquired the Borgward brand in 2017, part of Luckin’s marketing and sales team were relocated to support the new business,  reported  Chinese media. 
 Some business units were merged and relocated to Luckin in April, an employee who previously worked in platform infrastructure department at UCar tells  Tech in Asia . Many of those who remained at UCar will likely be laid off, the person said. Another UCar employee confirmed this assessment. 
 The problem with lightning-fast growth 
 Luckin’s billionaire founder is a distinctive and unapologetic character. In the first few months after the anonymous report was released, Lu was outspoken about believing in Luckin’s business model and criticized Nasdaq’s delisting notices, which were served in May and June. 
 In Chinese media, Lu is often compared with beleaguered Chinese tech tycoon Yueting Jia, founder of electric vehicle startup Faraday Future. 
 Both Lu and Jia came from nothing and aspired to be known in the business world. They’re also persuasive talkers who can sell a good story. 
 Lu’s companies follow a strategy that focuses on fast growth and IPOs. This sped-up process means investors have less time to do thorough due diligence. 
 There will be pressure to rush into deals that look promising without full due diligence. 
 Among his ventures, Car Inc. was Lu’s first success. It went public after seven years, significantly longer than to UCar and Luckin, which took 18 months and 17 months, respectively, to do an IPO.

 While there’s nothing inherently wrong with a fast-growth approach, it tends to mask issues with the underlying fundamentals of a business, observes CMR’s Cavender. 
 Graham of Sino Global Capital concurs, adding that though high growth isn’t necessarily a cause for concern, investors should step up its efforts to know how the company is achieving this. “Unfortunately, with the large amount of private equity funding that is on the sidelines waiting for deals, there will be pressure to rush into deals that look promising without full due diligence,” he says. 
 Lu’s playbook often begins with jumping on the bandwagon of a hot trend. UCar, for example, rode the mobility and electric vehicle wave while Luckin adopted the new retail concept that has become popular in China in the past few years. However, there’s a fine line between buying into the hype and creating a working business model based on a new technology or a novel idea. 
 The next phase is to raise multiple rounds quickly to finance its cash-burning expansion and user acquisition efforts. Joy Capital’s Liu Erhai and Centurium Capital’s Li Hui became important figures in all three businesses. And the end goal, of course, is for the companies to go public. 
 The corporate governance standards of Chinese businesses have long been  questionable  to the outside world. The opaque information sharing as well as lack of guidance from the Chinese government level are among the many reasons for this suspicion. 
 Another possible explanation to why Luckin was able to pull off the fraud is CEO duality, which refers to a situation where the company CEO and chairman roles are held by the same person. The chairman is the head of the board of directors, and the board is tasked with monitoring how the CEO runs the company. 
 CEO duality is common among companies that have grown rapidly and still retain the founding team in their roles. Pinduoduo was a case in point, until founder Huang Zheng resigned as CEO earlier this month. 
 While CEO duality can mean faster more efficient decision-making, it can also be an issue as it reduces the checks and balances needed to avoid giving top-level management excessive power. It can also erode corporate governance. 
 Lu and Qian, Luckin’s former chairman and ex-CEO, have a close relationship. Qian worked with Lu for 13 years and served as UCar’’s chief operating officer as well as the co-founder of Car Inc. 
 Insufficient checks 
 Luckin’s fall from grace is no doubt dramatic, but it is not unique. Overstating figures to defraud investors is widespread in China, according to legal and investment experts. 
 Dan Harris, a lawyer at Harris Bricken, a firm that specializes in China investments, tells  Tech in Asia  in an email that it is common for Chinese companies to keep inaccurate books. 
 He points out that it’s easy to assume that getting on a US exchange means certain minimum requirements have been met, according to Harris. However, many investors don’t realize that the requirements for Chinese companies to list in the US have been relaxed. In contrast, there are certain exemptions to financial oversight that a US company wouldn’t receive. This creates a potential regulatory gap in which there’s minimal transparency, Harris says. 
 Due diligence is costly: It takes a lot of man hours by qualified professionals and may appear unnecessary when everything appears to be fine, explains Chris Devonshire-Ellis, chairman and founding partner of professional services firm Dezan Shira &amp; Associates.

 Any suggestion that “We don’t need to spend this money” when discussing operational or other audits is almost certainly a sign that there’s something fishy going on, he says. 
 “The reason these types of fraud occur is that trust is built on the back of friendly relationships, with personnel designated to conduct operational checks having their heads turned,” adds Devonshire-Ellis. In fact, more cunning mainland Chinese often use this tactic on overseas Chinese, who are usually not trained to deal with the “deliberate ruse” that often involves banquets, drinking, invitations to premium events, gifts, and women, he says. 
 In theory, it should be easy to spot areas where red flags should have been raised during due diligence. But in practice, it’s difficult to do when there are time constraints and when underwriters or investors are competing for lucrative investment opportunities or underwriting slots. 
 Sino Global Capital’s Graham also thinks that sometimes, there’s simply too much momentum and appetite for an investment that concerns are downplayed. 
 Then there’s the irresistible appeal of China. Investors can get caught up in the growth story, particularly since Chinese tech IPOs have been so hyped up in recent years. 
 “This is especially true in a market like China where an interesting business model is likely to attract a lot of competitors. Investments into those competitors lead to a lot of cash burn but no profits,” notes Cavender of CRM. The boom and  bust of dockless bikes  in the country illustrates his point. 
 That said, fraudulent companies are hardly unique to China, with Wirecard and Enron as examples. 
 The aftermath 
 As UCar as well as three other auto services controlled by Lu are struggling financially and undergoing internal restructuring, some employees are hoping to relocate to Luckin as they see a better future there. 
 But after a recent court ruling, Lu lost control of all his shares in the embattled coffee company. 
 In an attempt to do damage control, UCar agreed to sell a 17.1% stake in Car Inc. to private equity firm Warburg Pincus in two tranches for HK$1.12 billion in April, but the second part of the deal fell through. 
 In June, UCar agreed to sell all 21.26% shares in Car Inc. to Beijing Automotive Group. The move would help sever financial ties between Lu and Car Inc and save the company from suffering further from Luckin’s troubles. 
 
  Guo Jinyi, CEO and chairman of Luckin Coffee 
 
 Despite attempts to distance himself from Luckin and Car Inc., Lu’s influence still lingers. Guo Jinyi, Luckin’s new CEO and chairman, served as Lu’s assistant when he was chairman at Car Inc. 
 At this point, Kuang of Lens Company Research thinks that only one is for sure. “Lu has lost his control over Luckin, and it is only a matter of time before creditors demand Lu to liquidate all his shares in the UCar exit,” he says. 
 Whether Luckin will survive this ordeal will depend on how it can negotiate and reach an agreement with investors, said Kuang. At present, the company is dealing with expensive investor compensation claims and facing  class action lawsuits  filed by investors.

653104,Indonesia’s stunting issue,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Hello readers, 
 While we’ve often talked about Indonesia’s impending boom this decade, Southeast Asia’s biggest economy is facing a crisis:  childhood stunting . The issue – if unresolved – could slow down the country’s overall economic growth. 
 Scroll down if you fancy a short summary. 
  But first, here are your quick bytes for the day:  
 1️⃣ Jack Ma has always been seen as the leader of the pack in China, so his move for Ant Group to go public has  prompted  some to follow suit. For one, Waterdrop, the insurance tech startup backed by Tencent, is  preparing  for an IPO with a US$4 billion valuation. Tesla competitor WM Motor is also  considering  an IPO in Shanghai. 
 2️⃣ Good news: A South Korean pharmaceutical company backed by Bill Gates may have  200 million  coronavirus vaccine kits ready by next June. Singapore, too, is in the race to produce a vaccine, and it looks to be on track with testing on  humans  to commence this week. 
 3️⃣ The Indian court has  summoned  Jack Ma after an ex-employee of UCWeb – the mobile internet company that Alibaba acquired in 2014 – alleged that the company had censored content and posted false news. 
 4️⃣ Working from home ain’t  going too well  in Japan: Bureaucrats from different ministries still aren’t able to hold teleconferences together, and most of their administrative work can’t be done online. Perhaps the solution is consolidating co-living and co-working spaces? In this subscriber-only piece, we explore what happens  when remote working becomes the new normal . 
 5️⃣ Your next iPhone could just be  assembled in India  as Apple slowly aims to scale up its production efforts in the country. 
 6️⃣ Last quarter, India’s top premium smartphone brand was  Oneplus , which stole the spot from Samsung. The country’s budget phone segment is also a competitive one, with Xiaomi, Vivo, Samsung and more in the mix. One young contender in particular is  rising very quickly . 
 
 The childhood stunting issue in Indonesia 
    
 Indonesia has the world’s fourth-largest population. But the nation also ranks high in another aspect:  its childhood stunting rates . 
 
 
 Among the highest in the world : In 2019, nearly 8 million children under the age of five were stunted in Indonesia.  
 
 Children’s stunted growth  – often stemming from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation – can lead to a loss of around US$20 billion for the country’s gross domestic income. That’s equivalent to 13.8% of Indonesia’s income per year. This may just hold back the nation’s goal to reach a gross domestic product of  US$7.3 trillion by 2045 . 
 
 It’s not just monetary : Childhood stunting also means that the next generation of Indonesians would only be 53% as productive as they would have been. That could mean bad news for the entrepreneurs and the tech companies setting up offices there. 
 
 Government intervention to the rescue : The government launched a program which succeeded in reducing stunting levels by 3.1% – from 30.8% in 2018 to 27.7% in 2019 – but it’s still far from the goal of below 20%.

 Another Covid-19 casualty: An Indonesian fashion startup 
   
Sorabel, an Indonesian fashion ecommerce startup, is  set to close down  after the pandemic wiped out its cash reserves. 
 
 
 On its way to profitability : Sorabel was founded in 2014 and was gunning to become profitable following a rebrand in January 2019r. Revenue grew by 2.4x from the beginning of 2019 to end of the year. 
 
 US$27 million in disclosed funding : The startup was backed by investors such as Gobi Partners, Kejora-InterVest Star Growth Fund, SMDV, Openspace Ventures, and Alpha JWC Ventures, among others. It raised two bridge rounds – one in May 2019 and another in August 2019 – but these weren’t enough. 
 
 Hanging by a thread : According to its founder, the company never had more than six months of runway since 2016.

653121,"How to create a moneymaking mobile app, according to Huawei AppsUP contest judges"," To say that there’s an app for everything is no longer an overstatement. From messaging and transportation to games and even  dating , mobile apps have become synonymous with everyday life. 
 This is particularly true in Asia Pacific, where mobile users will account for 50% of global app installs by the end of this year. And in 2019,  over US$200 billion was spent on mobile advertising in the region . 
 But success isn’t guaranteed for all. Plenty of random, dubious, or low-quality apps never see any traction, which raises the question: What makes for a quality, monetizable mobile application? 
 The panel of judges for  AppsUP , Huawei’s app innovation contest, shared their insights on how to do just this. 
 Fulfilling needs 
 At its core, developing successful mobile apps comes down to one thing: creating value for users. 
 “The primary impact of all successful apps is in enriching work and life by adding significant value in enhancing the work we do or the lifestyle we crave for,” says Suresh Jayaraju, CEO and founder of India-based  Innovopod , a company that aims to democratize innovation. For him, the most important goals should be to help people save time, enhance their productivity, entertain them, and keep them up to date with the news – a particularly important feature amid the pandemic.

 “[Good apps] simplify our life, keep things short and sweet, help to connect people, and help us save money,” echoes Johnson Lim, the president of the  Malaysia Mobile Technology Association  – a professional body that represents the interests of mobile service providers in Malaysia. Fundamentally, a monetarily successful app knows what people want and is built to provide that, he says. 
 While not all app use cases are indispensable, these improve users’ quality of life nonetheless. Besides, the gaps aren’t always apparent until an app comes along to fill it, says Richard Chua, general manager of mobile game developer and publisher  IGG Singapore . 
 “For example, for apps like Grab and Gojek, they started by solving a real problem for commuters, and evolved into something much bigger over time,” he says. This is also the case with other players like music app Deezer, messaging app Viber, and Philippine digital payments platform PayMaya, shares Chua. 
 “Ultimately, it’s about understanding the user and their needs, many of which may be latent and unsaid,” Jayaraju notes. 
 Nailing the technicalities 
 Despite this, good ideas can also fall apart if the execution is lacking –  even internet sensation Vine flamed out almost as quickly as it came to prominence . Failures can happen due to any number of things, from vague value propositions to a lack of marketing or even simply neglecting to localize a product to the market or users it’s aimed at. 
 “Developers must keep in mind their target audience,” says Chua. “For example, an app targeting users in developing countries should work well on ‘low-spec’ devices, but an app for private banking clients need not.” 
 The general manager also points out the importance of an intuitive user interface – even in mobile games, the learning curve must not be so steep that users give up on using it. To this end, he recommends not trying to reinvent the wheel. “Stick to widely accepted conventions for the UI. For example, icons should be instantly recognizable. Users should ideally be able to find what they are looking for immediately.” 
 Additionally, software developer kits (SDKs) play a big part in getting an app set up for success, as they provide a set of software tools and programs that developers can use to build applications for specific platforms. These tools include documentation, code samples, processes, and guides that developers can use and integrate into their own apps.

 “SDKs made publicly available decrease the time spent on coding from scratch,” says Jonathan De Luzuriaga, president of the  Philippine Software Industry Association . “This speeds up deployment by not needing to code from a blank slate.” 
 As for SDKs that help with monetization, Jayaraju says Huawei’s In-App Purchase Kit (IAP) is a good example. Not only does the SDK help developers integrate mainstream payment modes into their apps, it also covers automatic pricing for products using 78 languages and local currencies in over 170 countries and regions. “By enabling subscription services and management, it helps developers obtain loyal users and a stable revenue stream,” explains Jayaraju. 
 De Luzuriaga adds that if a developer is already familiar with the process of creating an app, it’s actually quite easy to transition to HMS Core – Huawei’s open capabilities of mobile services that includes SDKs and application programming interfaces that developers can use to create and upgrade apps. “The SDKs used under HMS make it easier to develop and modify apps to be available and monetizable across Huawei smartphones, which maintains a 17.8% global market share,” he says, pointing out the potential opportunities. 
 The ease of transition to HMS core – which just takes three days – is enabled by local development technical support engineers from Huawei, who guide the development process, as well as  DigiX lab  which offers support in the form of remote services and capabilities testing. 
 The apps of tomorrow 
 Looking ahead, apps will play an even larger role in everyday life, riding  the wave of digitization that the Covid-19 pandemic set in motion . “App development will power digitization exponentially. A new wave of basic needs shall be expected to arise in the near future considering the new normal that we are now starting to experience,” says De Luzuiraga. 
 Pariwat Wongsamran, a director at Startup Thailand, agrees. “Mobile apps will play a bigger role in our daily life; telemedicine apps, food delivery apps, e-learning apps – everything can be done just on mobile apps,” he says. “In fact, this is just the beginning: I believe many traditional sectors such as real estate and the government will also transform as mobile apps become part of the new reality of our everyday lives.” 
 For Jayaraju, the core philosophies around product creation and user adoption and usage won’t change, but marketing and development methods and tactics need to be adopted to suit trends, user behavior, and user preferences as they evolve. 
 “Developers should also always design with the future in mind because chances are, by the time they release the game or app – after a 12-to-18 month development cycle – the technology will be significantly more advanced,” Chua insists. “Time is of the essence.”

651733,"As Covid-19 wipes out ride-hailing, Myanmar’s Oway turns to online groceries"," Covid-19 has taken a heavy toll on ride-hailing startups worldwide. Uber, one of the biggest names in the industry, has laid off  6,700 employees and closed 34 offices  due to the pandemic. 
 Southeast Asian players Grab and Gojek have taken similar measures to save on costs during the crisis, with the former  slashing  360 jobs – around 5% of its total headcount – and the latter  letting go  of 430 people, or 9% of its staff.

 Myanmar-based Oway Group has found itself in a similar situation. 
 The company started off in 2012 as Oway Travel and Tours – an online travel platform that remains to be the group’s largest business to date – before entering the ride-hailing market in 2015 with Oway Ride. The company has raised a total of US$26 million so far from investors such as the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation, Openspace Ventures, Emerging Markets Group Holding Corporation, and Daiwa PI Partners. 
 However, Oway CEO Alok Kumar tells  Tech in Asia  that the pandemic has “completely decimated” the ride-hailing and travel sectors in Myanmar, forcing the company to move fast and accelerate its planned entry into the online grocery space. 
  Switching lanes  
 Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar where Oway Ride is based out of, stayed mostly quiet in April after the government imposed lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus. The stay-at-home orders were then extended in May for several townships in Myanmar. 
 Kumar shares that these strict measures have affected Oway’s business lines both negatively and positively. With traveling banned and people wanting to stay safe, Oway Travel and Tours has seen a drop in activity, Kumar says, without sharing specific figures. 
 Meanwhile, the company’s corporate fleet service, Oway Fleet, has seen an increase in demand, though this uptick isn’t enough to offset the losses from the company’s other services, the CEO notes. 
 Oway now relies on its online supermarket, Oway Fresh, to keep the small momentum. 
 According to Kumar, Oway Fresh is an end-to-end ecommerce service, taking care of not just delivery but also sourcing, quality control, and packaging. It’s focused on everyday needs such as fruits, vegetables, and meat. 
 It also offers non-food items from focused categories such as personal care, cleaning supplies, and baby products. In the future, the company is considering adding healthcare products and essential services to the mix. 
 Oway Fresh has partnered with fast-moving consumer goods companies such as Unilever and tapped into its own network of driver partners for deliveries. 
 “We are using the distribution margin from our partners as our revenue model,” says Kumar. “Consumers benefit – they get to buy better quality at the same, or better prices, compared to street vendors or other platforms.” 
 The service has only been live for over a month with a small active user base, but results have been promising, Kumar says. 
 “We are using word of mouth as our key channel for customer acquisition, and our focus is to drive customer lifetime value by incentivizing repeat purchase either by delighting on service delivery or other value-added services like free exchange,” Kumar shares. As of now, 22% of purchases from Oway Fresh come from return customers, the chief exec adds. 
 Staying on the right track 
 According to Kumar, Oway Fresh’s gross margin is currently in the double digits. Without sharing specific financial details, he says that the business aims to double its numbers month on month for the next six months. 
 While Kumar is confident that the company will be able to make a business out of Oway Fresh, as it already did with Fleet and Travel and Tours, he says a key challenge right now is whether it can become sustainable after the pandemic dies down. 
 A study from consultancy firm Bain &amp; Company and Facebook, however, showed that ecommerce and other digital trends, including grocery delivery, are  here to stay . 
 Nonetheless, Oway has adopted a strategy called “on time in full” to help its grocery business stay relevant even after Covid-19 blows over. “We commit to 100% delivery of what’s available on Oway Fresh within 24 hours. We help our consumers get the best products in the fastest way and at best value,” notes Kumar. 
 That being said, Oway Fresh is going up against stiff competition. Grocery delivery in general has seen a boost in adoption amid social distancing measures – an uptick that other companies have also taken notice of. 
 Other ride-hailing companies, including Grab and Gojek, have doubled down on the sector to make up for losses in their core transportation businesses. In Grab’s case, its  expansion plans for GrabMart  include Myanmar. 
 In Pakistan, bus app Airlift Technologies also announced an offshoot service called  Airlift Grocer  as it waits for its core transit business to get back up to speed. 
 Oway also competes with established players such as FreshGora, which has been in the scene since 2018, and Myanmore, owned by regional delivery and ride-hailing firm Meal Temple Group. 
 Meanwhile, the chief exec says that the operations of Oway Travel and Tours and Oway Ride have been slowly recovering. 
 The former has shifted focus to the domestic market, providing value-added services for local travel and tours. Kumar says that the business, along with Oway Ride, has seen an increased demand in the past few weeks. 
 “We see that there is an upgrade at each level of transportation. Consumers who used to travel by buses are taking taxis, and taxi users are upgrading to private short-term lease until Covid-19 is fully behind us,” he shares.

 Hello readers, 
 Xpeng’s  US$500 million  series C round this week has caught people’s attention. 
 Not only does the Chinese electric-car maker directly compete with Tesla, but it was also sued by the US company. Tesla claims that one of its ex-engineers had  stolen  its Autopilot source code and took it to Xpeng. 
 As the lawsuit continues, the rivalry between the two is expected to heat up, with Xpeng using its new funds for product development and manufacturing. It’s also likely to bankroll its first fully-owned car plant, which was granted a license earlier in May. 
 Tesla has an interesting update of its own: It’s reportedly hiring car service staff in Singapore. Might this move signal that it’s expanding outside China and into Southeast Asia? 
 You can find all the important investment deals that happened in the last few days in our  weekly funding news wrap-up . (🔒)

653032,Indonesian fashion startup Sorabel to close down as Covid-19 wipes out cash,"  Sorabel , an Indonesian fashion ecommerce startup, is set to close down as the Covid-19 pandemic wiped out its cash. 
 “Our business was hit very significantly, and we just didn’t have cash reserves to survive this major crisis,” Jeffrey Yuwono, co-founder and former CEO of Sorabel, told  Tech in Asia . 
 
  Photo credit: Sorabel 
 
 The company is now under “administration,” which means it has appointed a third-party administrator to look after the interests of its shareholders and creditors. 
 According to Sorabel chief financial officer Kevin Widlansky, it’s possible that the company might liquidate parts of Sale Stock – the company behind Sorabel – while another company may acquire the rest, including the Sorabel brand. If that happens, the Sorabel brand may continue to exist and some employees may also stay with the company, with the acquiring company leading the business. 
 Local media  DailySocial  earlier reported that Sorabel is undergoing a “liquidation process.” 
 “Due to this liquidation process, we have to terminate employment contracts with no exception, effective July 30. I am certain that no one would ever expect this to happen,” the company said in an internal letter to employees, a copy of which was obtained by  DailySocial . 
 However, Sorabel told  Tech in Asia  that the letter intended to inform employees that the company would not be able to pay salaries beyond this month and wouldn’t enter into liquidation or bankruptcy right away. 
 “Since 2016, we’ve never had more than six months of runway, and the downside of that is that it’s difficult to survive a big crisis,” Yuwono said. 
 Widlansky also said that the company had over six months of runway heading into Covid-19, but “it hit especially hard during Lebaran/Hari Raya because it hit demand all around but also constrained our ability to restock new goods.” 
 Founded in 2014 as Sale Stock, the company was on its way to  profitability  as of July 2019, following a rebrand in January of that year. It was also working to close a series C funding round. The startup raised a total of US$27 million from investors such as Gobi Partners, Kejora-InterVest Star Growth Fund, SMDV, and Alpha JWC Ventures, among others. 
 “It really felt like the rebrand had worked and we were on our way. We grew really quickly over the year from beginning to end year, grew revenue by 2.4x, and awareness for the Sorabel brand started to accelerate in Q4 of 2019,” Yuwono shared. 
 The company was also testing a store in the Philippines, with planned experiments in Vietnam and Cambodia. Its Philippine store, however,  closed down  in February this year. 
 Yuwono has resigned as Sorabel’s CEO since June, but he will still be involved with the company’s transition. Its co-founders Lingga Madu and Ariza Novianti, meanwhile, had left the company since late last year.

653047,The largest growth opportunities for ecommerce?,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Hello readers, 
 Since we hunkered down at home, ordering food, groceries, and other daily necessities online have become quite the norm. This could potentially present a great opportunity for ecommerce companies, especially those in the fast-moving goods sector (FMCG) sector. 
 Scroll down if you fancy a short summary or click  here for the full story  (🔒). 
  But first, here are your quick bytes for the day:  
 1️⃣ Amazon fills up its shopping cart: The tech giant is said to be in talks to  buy a 9.9% stake  in Indian conglomerate Reliance’s retail arm JioMart. This comes after Reliance has  wrapped up  (🔒) its recent fundraising spree at over $20 billion. 
 2️⃣ Going up against Amazon and JioMart is FlipKart, which is  taking over  its parent company Walmart’s loss-ridden cash-and-carry business in India, Best Price. It will launch a new digital marketplace called Flipkart Wholesale. Now, you and I might be used to using the typical ecommerce sites, but the gap in user interface, the public’s lack of trust in the process, and language barriers still account for social commerce’s rise  in India  (🔒) and  Indonesia  (🔒). 
 3️⃣ Despite its failed space mission with Russia 9 years ago, China ain’t giving up on its dream: The country  launched its first  independent mission to Mars. In 2019, community writer Wayne Shiong  wrote that  we may see “China’s new space Silk Road [within] the next decade” – and it looks like it’s progressing just fine. 
 4️⃣ While some startups like  Oyo  (🔒) and  Swiggy  are going through layoffs and pay reductions, B2B startups such as Razorpay, Simplilearn, and PhonePe are going on a  hiring spree . 
 5️⃣ With TikTok facing a potential ban by the U.S. government, a group of investors has come up with a plan:  Buy TikTok  from its Chinese owner. Looks like ex-Disney exec Kevin Mayer has had a busy few months since he was appointed  CEO of TikTok  (🔒) in May this year. 
 6️⃣ “Buy now, pay later” Australian tech giant Afterpay saw  its valuation soar  to close to A$20 billion at the time of writing. Outside of Australia, Pay-later products are starting to  become a force  (🔒) in Southeast Asia, as seen in the fast rise of Kredivo, Akulaku, and Oriente. 
 
 Big money for FMCG ecommerce peeps in Asia 
   
The winners during Covid-19?  Ecommerce players  (🔒). And it’s not just food deliveries that are booming: Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) could also likely present one of the largest growth opportunities for ecommerce in the years to come. 
 
 
 Eat at home : Many of the people surveyed in Southeast Asia said they would continue to eat at home more often even after Covid-19 has passed. 
 
 New relationship with food : Food deliveries ain’t the cheapest so more people have turned to cooking and baking, both for  therapeutic  as well as affordability reasons.  
 
 Opportunities for fresh food and groceries : In China, only 6.3% of fresh food is currently ordered online. But a lot of Chinese consumers are saying they don’t mind rolling with online grocery shopping even post-Covid-19. 
 
 Companies are already eyeing this pie : Alibaba, JD.com, Tencent, and Pinduoduo have doubled down on their FMCG investments. In Southeast Asia, Lazada owns online supermarket Redmart while Shopee is using livestreaming to showcase fresh food to consumers.

650871,How this ecommerce startup helps retailers in rural Bangladesh go online," Buying a new smartphone or laptop can be a pain for consumers living in Bangladesh’s rural areas. Digital brands, unfortunately, are not accessible in many of these neighborhoods. And even if they wanted to, these businesses can’t easily reach consumers in these areas because there aren’t enough resellers willing to carry inventory. 
 Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, though, may be the solution. These smaller players can easily penetrate neighborhoods and effectively connect brands with rural consumers. They’re also willing to be part of the ecommerce space, which currently takes up just less than 1% of the entire retail sector in Bangladesh, Asikul Alam Khan, founder and CEO of ecommerce startup  PriyoShop , tells  Tech in Asia . 
 “Instead of fighting with other digital commerce in the red ocean market, we decided to partner with the small retailers and make them the hub of digital commerce,” he says.

 The Bangladesh-based startup, which  won   Tech in Asia’s  Pitch Night in May, offers both an ecommerce marketplace and a retailer-facing app. It helps small retailers get more inventory from big brands such as Samsung and Philips, among others, and manages end-to-end fulfillment – from payments to logistics. 
 On PriyoShop’s platform, small retailers sell mobile phones, gadgets, lifestyle products, and other items. Customers, meanwhile, can make bill payments, place orders, and have products delivered to their doorstep. 
 The company is looking to add more services as well, such as bus and airline ticketing and travel booking. But with Covid-19 forcing people to stay at home, PriyoShop has started to deliver essential goods such as household staples, healthcare and personal care items, and safety products, among others. 
  Walmart-like ambition  
 Founded in 2013, the startup claims it currently has 500,000 monthly active users and 10,000 agents registered on its platform, who together cover 490 towns. 
 Its ambition: building a complete ecommerce network that “has the same buying power as Walmart,” attracting 1 million retailers and 100 million customers in three to four years.

 However, the ecommerce space is becoming increasingly crowded, even in Bangladesh, where the market is expected to reach US$3 billion by 2023, says Khan. Other players in the country include Alibaba-owned Daraz, electronics-focused Pickaboo, American Pegasus Tech Ventures-backed AjkerDeal, and Othoba, among others. 
 That being said, Khan notes that these platforms are all in self-help mode, requiring customers to download an app and set up their businesses on their own. 
 The CEO argues that people in Bangladesh, especially those who live in rural areas, need assistance to go online. “If you want to create something for the 170 million people, you need to think differently. The services are the same – commerce, digital commerce – but the channel matters a lot,” he says. 
 For now, PriyoShop needs to focus on bolstering its performance. 
 It secured angel funding in 2018, followed by a seed round from Accelerating Asia and Singapore-based angel investors in 2019. It’s now looking to raise pre-series A and series A money to further expand its business, develop its tech infrastructure, and hire more people to manage its supply chain. 
 “We are close to operating breakeven at a unit economic level. Our major cash burn is only for tech and people,” Khan says, adding that 2020 will be a “significant growth year” for the company. 
 Over the next two years, it aims to double down on partnerships and add 100,000 retailers to its platform in a bid to reach US$1 billion in gross merchandise volume and ramp up its user base by 40%. 
 “By reducing the need for a wholesale middleman, we effectively generate higher margins,” Khan says. 
 He also believes that consumers will be increasingly drawn to on-demand products and services, which may continue to drive ecommerce in the post-Covid-19 era. “Now that people are experiencing and expecting the security, simplicity, and seamlessness of digital commerce, there’s just no turning back.” ",Doris Yu,0,3,"[(0, 0.3210553), (1, 0.057174515), (2, 0.576311), (3, 0.04545922)]","['Alibaba', 'Philips', 'Samsung', 'PriyoShop', 'Othoba', 'AjkerDeal']","['Asia', 'Bangladesh', 'Singapore']"
652950,The role of real-time analytics during the pandemic," Within a short time since its emergence, Covid-19 has made a  significant impact on the world , affecting jobs, communities, and the way we go about our daily lives. 
 Something that is proving to be an asset in the fight against the virus is  data . It enables us to better understand Covid-19 across different areas, such as through identifying vulnerable populations based on historical factors or utilizing telecom data to track its spread. 
 Advancements in data analytics,  powered by artificial intelligence (AI) , have helped us use data more effectively during the pandemic. 
 Powering analytics with AI 
 In the medical research field, AI has helped analyze data around the virus itself. Baidu Research’s  open-source AI platform  was able to reduce the time needed to study Covid-19’s RNA sequence, enabling a deeper understanding of the virus that is necessary in vaccine creation. 
 AI has also helped scientists analyze the large amounts of data available about Covid-19,  harnessing information  from a variety of clinical trials in a bid to speed up the development of therapies and treatments.

 In addition, it has also been a useful asset in  epidemic modeling : By examining available data on the novel coronavirus and its relatives, scientists have been  working to predict  infection rates in order to provide information that governments can use to create measures for containing the viral outbreak. 
 AI has played an important role in  enhancing contact tracing measures  as well. For example, in China, AI is used to monitor movements and identify possible contacts of infected individuals – information that helps the government take action to mitigate the virus’ spread. 
 A is for active analytics 
 As useful as AI is to data analytics, one of the challenges researchers/analysts have been facing is  keeping up  with the vast amount of data that is being generated about the virus. 
 “The Covid-19 pandemic [has created] a fast-moving, changing environment where daily – if not hourly – updates are being presented, and things are moving very, very rapidly,” explains Stuart Fisher, president of the Asia Pacific and Japan division at analytics company  Kinetica . 
 In particular, it has emphasized the importance of doing a thorough but rapid study of the most updated data in order to make the best decisions. To that end, researchers and governments are turning to real-time analytics.

 In South Korea, for example, the government rolled out  an enhanced platform  that uses real-time data and analysis. It provides fast and accurate information on where patients have been and whom they’ve been in contact with in order to determine the scale of an outbreak effectively. 
 Kinetica takes this a step further by powering real-time analysis with advanced AI-driven analytics capabilities. This ability to analyze and react to data simultaneously in real time is what the company refers to as “active analytics”. 
 In the US, Kinetica’s Active Analytics Platform has been used in the  creation of a live data analytics program  to aggregate and track data relevant to emergency responders during the pandemic. 
 By pooling together information on hospital capacity, PPE availability, and test kit quantities, the program uses Kinetica’s Active Analytics Platform to generate insights in real time.

 This enables decision-makers to act quickly, whether in setting up alternative triage centers or redirecting patients to different hospitals to prevent medical services from being overwhelmed. 
 Data can also be fed into various AI models in a bid to forecast the spread of the virus and thus address problems before they arise. 
 One of the critical issues during the pandemic is the  global shortage  of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. 
 When such a situation arises, the program can help ensure that PPE is sent to where it is most needed, in the most efficient manner. 
 “There could be a predictive model that suggests a spike in Covid-19 cases in a certain location, where they’re going to need access to more PPE,” says Fisher. “We can use that information, together with geospatial data, to automatically route PPE to where it needs to go.” 
 The future is in real time 
 The  huge amount of data  available about Covid-19 grows every day, making access to and effective real-time analysis of it vital. This is where active analytics can play a huge role. 
 “Society has access to an enormous amount of data, but that data is held in various repositories in different databases and different locations,” says Fisher. “But only when we can access and leverage that data in real time can we really start to gain benefit from the ability to analyze and make decisions [based] on it.” 
 Being able to use the data we have, with the help of new emerging technologies like AI and machine learning, is key to  managing the ongoing pandemic  effectively – and making preparations for the next one. 
 
 Kinetica aims to deliver fast, near-instantaneous analysis of data that provides accurate insights in real time through its Active Analytics Platform. The platform analyzes billions of data points continuously to assist leaders in making dynamic business decisions.

653018,The next unicorn in Southeast Asia?,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Hello readers, 
 Here’s something we don’t see very often: A company that  tripled its revenue  (🔒) in just one year. But it’s not just revenue that went up – it recorded wider losses as well. 
 Scroll down if you fancy a summarized read. 
  But first, here are your quick bytes for the day:  
 1️⃣ Whatsapp India lays out its digital banking plan: It will  start pilot projects  that offer loans, microinsurance and micropension to users. With over 400 million users, the country is WhatsApp’s largest market. 
 2️⃣ For the young’uns who want cheaper rides, China’s  Didi Chuxing  got your back. It launched a new standalone ride-hailing service that offers more affordable rates. 
 3️⃣ Tesla is  reportedly hiring  a service technician and parts adviser in Singapore even if founder Elon Musk had criticized the government for  not being supportive  of electric vehicles. 
 4️⃣ As TikTok continues to face scrutiny over data privacy issues, its parent company ByteDance has plans to  double down  on its newly established education technology business. 
 5️⃣ After the demise of Mobike, Ofo, GrabCycle,and Obike in Singapore, a new challenger has emerged:  Anywheel . It has gotten approval to expand its fleet to 15,000 bicycles. On a related note, bike sharing may be useful, but it doesn’t make investment sense. We argued that  powerbank sharing  (🔒), though similar in many ways, could be worth your time and maybe investment. 
 6️⃣ You can now purchase  car insurance  on Amazon Pay in India. 
 
 That’s very cash money of you, Singlife 
   
Digital life insurance company Singlife took home US$171 million in revenue in 2019. That’s almost a  300% increase  (🔒) from US$54 million in 2018. 
 
 
 Founded in 2014 , it’s the newest kid on the insurance block, the only one to be licensed as a life insurer in Singapore in nearly 50 years. 
 
 Comfy cash cushion:  Besides raising a blockbuster US$50 million for its series A round in 2017 (with the help of  this pitch deck 🔒 ), the company had also secured US$90 million from Japan’s Sumitomo Life last year, bringing its total capital raised to US$153 million. 
 
 You rise, I rise:   But apart from its income, Singlife’s costs and expenses have also grown, quadrupling from US$49 million in 2018 to US$219 million last year. This caused a US$27 million in total comprehensive loss after recording US$1 million in profit in 2018. But given its fast revenue growth, it looks fine for now, and the loss is just a fraction of its war chest. 
 
 Potentially a unicorn?  According to a GCA Advisor  report , public insurtech companies are valued at a 2.2x next 12 months (NTM) revenue multiple. Taking that figure into account, Singlife should have a ballpark valuation of US$376 million based on its 2019 revenue. If it continues to see another 300% growth in revenue this year, Singlife could be the next unicorn from Southeast Asia.

652832,How TikTok is leveling the advertising playing field for small businesses," Making the most of meager budgets is a daily reality for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), pushing them to seek affordable options whenever they can. 
 This is especially true when it comes to advertising. Traditional modes of marketing  often come with high costs , so SMBs looking to get their names out there typically turn to digital strategies like social media marketing. 
 But this approach isn’t without its challenges. With the rapid rise of platforms across the world, social media marketing isn’t just a viable option for cash-strapped advertisers. It’s also an ideal channel for large corporations with 100x the ad budgets to reach global audiences. 
 Considering the way most social media platforms work and with marketing spend determining the reach of an ad, SMBs  might find themselves at a disadvantage  against bigger competitors. 
 However, short-video app TikTok could level the playing field for SMBs with the launch of its self-serve advertising solution,  TikTok for Business . 
 Democratizing advertising 
 By giving marketers access to a number of creative tools, TikTok’s new service allows them to produce ads in a variety of highly engaging formats and helps them reach their ideal audience. 
 “Whether it’s raising brand awareness, driving app installs, or increasing online and offline sales, businesses can use different formats to reach their marketing objectives,” says Chew Wee Ng, head of business marketing at TikTok. 
 
  Marketers can leverage TikTok for Business’ creative tools to achieve their marketing objectives in engaging formats. (Disclaimer: Not all ad formats are available on self-serve.) / Image credit: TikTok 
 
 With the short-video app’s highly engaging nature, these formats work especially well, she adds. For instance, brands can entice TikTok users to participate in hashtag challenges or create content using effects sponsored by a brand. 
 “It’s not just about likes, comments, or shares; it’s about participation,” says Ng. “On TikTok, you can get consumers spending 20 to 30 minutes of their time creating content and building a relationship with your brand.” 
 By leveraging TikTok’s wide array of creative tools to incite active collaboration among the platform’s community, SMBs can get discovered by their target audience just as effectively as large corporations. 
 A small online retailer in Vietnam, for instance, used TikTok for Business to create a short marketing campaign, which went on to record 130 million views and helped the retailer achieve over 12,000 transactions on its online store. 
 Indeed, Ng says the platform’s focus “is delivering results for brands and advertisers, regardless of the budgets they have.” 
 How to make a good TikTok ad 
 The approach to making creative content and ads on TikTok is fairly similar to other platforms: Create “snackable” content that captivates users’ attention in the first three seconds, leverage authentic storytelling, and understand your target audience. 
 “The best-performing ads on TikTok are the ones that tell authentic stories,” Ng shares. “So we encourage advertisers to focus on knowing who their consumers are and what they enjoy, then designing content based on that.” 
 That said, there are some considerations that are unique to advertising on TikTok. One habit that’s common for users of the app is that they tend to browse content with their volume turned on. 
 “TikTok was designed for a sound-on experience, and music can help increase the effectiveness of an ad’s message,” she says. “We’ve done some research, and we see that for brands that use music, those that have 120 beats per minute and above have better recall.” 
 TikTok for Business also offers a wide range of tools to create interactive features such as call-to-action buttons, which the marketing executive highly recommends advertisers make full use of. 
 Moreover, the nature of TikTok’s content opens up opportunities for businesses to collaborate with popular creators. 
 “Collaborative participation is in our DNA,” Ng says. “Think about how you can get the community to collaborate with you.” 
 On top of making the ad experience less intrusive and more engaging for TikTok’s users, these unique features also put an even greater emphasis on the importance of crafting innovative content. With that, SMBs no longer have to worry about having limited ad budgets – all they need to do is get creative. 
 
 TikTok for Business enables companies of all sizes to reach their ideal audiences with a simple and easy-to-use advertising platform. 
  Register  for  Tech in Asia ’s online webinar, “How SMBs can shine on TikTok,” where representatives from the company share the best practices businesses can leverage to effectively advertise and create content on the short-video platform. It is particularly geared towards SMBs in Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. 
   
 Sign up on TikTok’s  website  to get free ad credits. Eligible SMBs can claim a one-time ad credit worth US$300 to be used by December 31, 2020. Additional spend will be matched one-to-one with ad credit worth up to US$2,000 per business.

652749,A visual checklist: Content marketing during a crisis (Infographic)," The Covid-19 pandemic has brought many businesses to a standstill in the past few months. 
 Cost-cutting activities are the special of the day as firms attempt to adapt to  lower consumer spending  amid lockdown measures. 
 However, marketing spend shouldn’t necessarily be part of these cutbacks. Research has shown that in previous recessions, brands who panicked and slashed all ad spending saw their market share, and therefore profitability,  drop over the long term . 
 That said, the answer isn’t to spend indiscriminately. Thoughtfulness is important and understanding exactly what space the company occupies in the market and how it can  contribute meaningfully to the Covid-19 conversation  can be the difference between survival and defeat. 
 Content marketing, with its storytelling ability, puts the focus on the company and its values. It plays a long-term role in establishing a brand’s share of voice – which is  heavily correlated to market share  – making it an ideal weapon for the current battle. 
 Here are the key tips to effective content marketing. 
   
 On July 16,  Tech in Asia  hosted an online chat between Ayumi Nakajima, Pinterest’s country manager for Southeast Asia and India, and Andrew Baisley, managing director of Tech in Asia Studios, to discuss the nuances of marketing during a crisis. 
 The conversation covered several topics including how companies should optimize marketing resources, craft content, as well as evolve their marketing efforts as the Covid-19 situation develops.

652986,Analysis: FMCG ecommerce set to boom in Asia," Covid-19 has been a major catalyst for ecommerce adoption, catapulting digital shopping from a convenience to a necessity for households all over the world. In particular, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) appear to be having a moment as consumer behavior and purchasing habits permanently shift to ordering groceries and daily necessities online. 
 In China, however, only 6.3% of fresh food and 8.8% of alcoholic beverages are currently ordered online vs. 44% ecommerce penetration for broader retail. 
   
 This gap represents a huge opportunity for the country’s ecommerce companies, given that they can ride on this “catch-up effect” to grow gross merchandise value (GMV). For example, assuming the ecommerce penetration for fresh food rises to become equal with broader retail ecommerce, it would imply a ~7x GMV uplift for the category. 
  This uplift potential is supported by large shifts in consumer behavior.  
 The present crisis, for one, is a catalyst of such shifts. According to a recent survey by Nielsen, 67% of Chinese consumers shopped for fresh food and daily necessities more than twice a week amid the pandemic, with 89% saying they would be willing to purchase these goods online even after the effects of Covid-19 ease. 
 Already, companies like Alibaba, JD.com, and Pinduoduo have taken note of this structural trend and have doubled down on their FMCG investments via services like Freshippo and JD Supermarket. Firms like Tencent have also backed online grocery startups such as Missfresh and Xingsheng Youxuan in a greater push toward ecommerce. 
 These companies that have invested in their FMCG ecommerce offerings have easily outperformed broader indices such as the MSCI China and NASDAQ. 
   
 The FMCG phenomenon is not unique to China; consumers across Southeast Asia are also emerging from Covid-19 with more homebody attitudes 
 It’s not just people in China who are emerging from the pandemic with more “homebody” mentalities; Southeast Asians are, too. According to research firm Nielsen, more than half of consumers in several countries across the region plan to eat at home more often even after the crisis blows over. 
   
 As illustrated above, 62% of Malaysians and Vietnamese say they plan to eat at home more frequently post-Covid-19, while 56% of Thais and 50% of Singaporeans also plan to eat out less. These results indicate that consumer behavior across many Southeast Asian nations are permanently changing to adapt to buying groceries and cooking at home more. 
 Vaughan Ryan, managing director of Southeast Asia at Nielsen, explains: “In a number of Asian markets, [ecommerce] sales are regularly exceeding 20% to 25% of the average weekly sales across FMCG every week since the end of January. Consumers have been back to the same store multiple times, so this behavior is beyond panic buying. There is no doubt consumers have moved away from an on-the-go lifestyle to more of a ‘safe in-home consumption’ trend.” 
 Southeast Asian ecommerce champions Lazada and Shopee adopt features and tactics from China 
 As the demand for grocery and FMCG products spiked, Lazada and Shopee were already well-positioned to capture the sudden uptick owing to the past experiences of their Chinese investors. 
  Lazada leveraged online supermarkets and virtual stores to connect farmers with consumers  
 In November 2016, for example, Alibaba-owned Lazada had acquired online supermarket business Redmart, allowing it to immediately serve customers in Singapore the moment lockdowns hit. According to the company, online grocery sales grew 4x when lockdowns were initiated in April, with unique daily visitors jumping 11x. 
 In Malaysia, Lazada also launched a virtual store to connect farmers in the Cameron Highlands district with consumers. The initiative was a great success that saw approximately 70 tons of vegetables being delivered from farms directly to people’s homes by the third week of its launch. 
  Shopee capitalized on livestreaming to showcase fresh food and wares to consumers  
 Tencent-backed Shopee was also prepared for the sudden spike in online FMCG demand, having launched its own livestreaming service, “Shopee Live,” back in June 2019. 
 This allowed the company to showcase its range of fresh food and daily necessities to customers in real-time and helped reduce barriers to adoption by addressing “old-school” mentalities of needing to see products before buying them. 
 With the livestreaming service, customers could watch videos of dishes being cooked in real-time and purchase the ingredients used (rice, carrots, onions, etc.) immediately on the app. 
   
 The twin catalysts of Covid-19 and China’s tech Influence are poised to accelerate Southeast Asia’s adoption of online FMCG purchases 
 While it was the impact of Covid-19 that forced people to adopt online FMCG shopping in the short term, it is the increased convenience and safety that will ultimately convince Southeast Asian consumers to stay for the long haul. 
 China-pioneered tactics such as ecommerce livestreaming and  the consumer-to-manufacturer (C2M) model  can also go a long way in helping provide end consumers a sense of assurance on a product’s quality and freshness.

 Importantly, grocery ecommerce had already been the fastest-growing online category in Southeast Asia even before the lockdowns. Covid-19 had merely acted as an impetus to the trend. 
 As of January 2019, food and personal care grew the fastest among all ecommerce categories in Southeast Asia, with a 35% increase. Notably, all six major Southeast Asian countries also posted grocery ecommerce growth of at least double that of the global average, according to figures cited by Hootsuite and We are Social. 
   
   
 Though FMCG ecommerce has plenty of promise in Southeast Asia, the region poses unique challenges. Ecommerce infrastructure like logistics and payments remain a work in progress in places like  Vietnam  and Indonesia, which features a fragmented FMCG supply chain that’s  dominated by incumbents . 
 But unique approaches are emerging that might prove effective. A number of startups, for instance, are employing agents that buy goods on behalf of their neighbors and serve as collection points, cutting down logistical costs. 
 Regardless, ordering FMCG online is simply more efficient, and China’s large tech companies are focused on Southeast Asia for expansion, with investment stakes in major regional players. 
 So while FMCG ecommerce in the region will certainly evolve with unique local characteristics, it’s likely to be one of the largest growth opportunities for ecommerce in the years to come.

652659,Singapore fresh grads are more interested in tech jobs and startups in 2020," For local students and university graduates in Singapore, careers in tech have become more desirable than ever in 2020, according to  an annual national graduate careers survey  by GTI Media Singapore. 
 In addition, graduates now show increased interest in launching startups, with more than 30% of respondents saying they were keen on founding their own businesses either during their studies or right after graduation. 
 GTI Media Singapore surveyed more than 14,000 students and fresh graduates from local universities for our annual Singapore Graduate Barometer survey, which ran from June 2019 to February 2020. Respondents were asked to name the employers they intended to apply for upon graduation.

 Results show that tech firms in Singapore are continuing to enjoy significant gains in popularity among fresh graduates. In a survey-derived list of the 100 most popular employers, tech firms in general rose in rank this year from 2019 – a sign of a continuing trend of local graduates looking to start their careers in tech, which began manifesting in 2018. 
 Microsoft, which was ranked no. 1 in 2019, maintained its position as the employer local students most want to work for after graduation. Tech firms with operations in Singapore such as Amazon, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Grab, Micron, Samsung, and Shopee rose in popularity as well, along with finance firms DBS Bank and Visa, which have been pushing aggressively to fill fintech roles. 
 “We believe the upheaval from the Covid-19 pandemic this year set many students toward thinking of tech careers as a more stable pathway,” said Isaac Hee, managing director at GTI Media Singapore. “The data from our survey shows that firms offering tech careers have universal appeal among students across all disciplines of study, even those who do not come from STEM-related majors.” 
 The top 10 tech firms that Singaporean graduates would like to apply to for their first job are: 
 
 Microsoft 
 Amazon 
 Micron 
 Accenture 
 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 
 Intel 
 Shopee 
 Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency (DSTA) 
 Grab 
 IBM 
 
 In addition, when asked if they were considering founding startups either before or after graduating, 32% of those surveyed said yes – up from 27% in 2019 and 26% in 2018. 
 “With all the news out there about companies cutting back on hiring or laying off staff this year, perhaps graduates now feel they have less to lose by founding a startup, even despite the risks involved,” Hee said. “The opportunity cost of venturing out on your own may not seem that high anymore, all things considered.” 
 Despite investors being more cautious, appetite for funding tech ventures “has been relatively stable in 2020,” he said. This is particularly true given how the lives of consumers are increasingly moving online now. “No doubt, graduates are taking notice of that as well during these interesting times,” the managing director added. 
 When asked to state the factors that most influenced their selection of employers, the graduates stated their top five priorities as (in descending order): 
 
 
 Good career prospects : The promise of promotions and professional growth opportunities 
 
 Positive employer leadership : Knowing that they would be working under effective, principled leaders 
 
 Personal development opportunities : Being able to grow their personal skill sets beyond the realm of work (e.g., soft skills, personal interests, etc.) 
 
 Being appreciated at work : Visible recognition for work done and knowing that their efforts have an impact 
 
 Equal opportunities and diversity : Workplaces that expressly offer an equal playing field to all regardless of gender, sexuality, race, religion, disability, social background, etc. 
 
 In addition, close to 79% of graduates stated that moral and ethical considerations play an important role in their choice of employer, indicating that personal values and principles matter strongly to them when making early career decisions despite how tough prospects may seem this year.

  What are its future plans?  With the new funds, the company said it plans to further enhance the capabilities of its growth management platform. 
 This includes investing in its AI to create flexible algorithms suitable for clients in the travel, media, and finance sectors, among others, Insider told  Tech in Asia.   
 The company also plans to bolster its R&amp;D team and invest in its global sales and marketing efforts, as it looks to make its presence more known in the West. 
 “We plan to grow substantially in our existing 24 countries, and we are now ready to enter the US market and believe that our fresh solutions to marketers’ biggest pain points will be a major differentiator,” added Insider co-founder and CEO Hande Cilingir.

  How much traction has it gotten?  Since the company’s series B round in 2018, it was able to expand its presence in Asia Pacific, Europe, and Latin America from 15 countries to 24. Insider’s client base also more than doubled from over 300 to upwards of 800. 
 “We have built a truly multichannel platform with the widest product feature set to become the preferred platform of choice for marketers worldwide,” the company said. 
 Insider also bumped up its global team from 202 to 562 since its last funding round. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  Insider said that finding and hiring the right talent as it expands into newer geographies continue to be two of its biggest challenges.

 While most of its verticals , such as the ecommerce and fintech ones, have been making losses, AirAsia’s logistics delivery arm Teleport is kinda soaring: It recorded a positive EBITDA in 2019 and grew almost tenfold from the year before. 
 
 Teleport to profitability?  AirAsia has rapidly onboarded merchants to its platforms and is  planning to launch credit and lending facilities in the future. Can these strategies take AirAsia to new heights, following its staff cuts and overall business losses?

652704,Why investing in human capital can save Indonesia’s future generation,"   ﻿  ﻿  ﻿   
 ||item|| 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
  The startup ecosystem talks a lot about Indonesia’s impending  boom this decade    and how entrepreneurs and investors can capitalize on the opportunities. But for this growth to be sustainable, Indonesia has to ensure it curbs one major issue: childhood stunting.  
  Stunting, defined as the impaired growth and development of children, often happens to kids who experience poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation . A ccording to the  Ministry of National Development Planning   , the problem will lead to a 3% loss in the country’s gross domestic income – around US$20 billion or the equivalent to 13.8% of the nation’s income per year.   
  Nutrition interventions are among the most cost-effective investments for human capital. Priority packages for nutrition intervention only costs US$2.3 per child per year, while a full package costs US$7 per child per year.   
  A report by  the World Bank  also found that   early nutrition programs have been shown to increase school completion by one year, raise adult wages by 5% to 50%, and increase gross domestic product by 4% to 11% in Asia (10.5% in Indonesia).   In addition, children who escape stunting are 33% more likely to break out of poverty as adults.  
 ABOUT 
  Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s biggest economy and has the world’s fourth-largest population. Today, 51% of its population is under the age of 30, gearing the nation up to reap  the benefits of a demographic bonus   . But pushing the quality of human capital is still one of the government’s biggest tasks.  
  While Indonesia has successfully decreased early childhood mortality, its stunting rates are among the highest in the world.  
  The condition has lifelong consequences for health, human capital, poverty, and equity. In 2019, nearly 8 million children under the age of five were stunted, higher than most regional and income-level peers.   
  What’s more, being stunted in early childhood is associated with reduced cognitive development, lower educational attainment, and decreased adult productivity and wages. This means Indonesia’s next generation will only be  53%    as productive as it could have been if given full health and complete education.  
 
   ﻿  ﻿   
 
  Government intervention  
  In August 2017, Indonesia’s government launched the National Strategy to Accelerate Stunting Prevention (StraNas Stunting) in an effort to combat the issue. The country committed 22 ministries and approximately  US$14.6 billion    to cover priority interventions across several sectors: health, water and sanitation, early childhood education, social protection, and food security.  
  The strategy targeted 160 districts with high stunting rates in 2019 and will be scaled up to 390 districts in 2020. By next year, it plans to target all 514 districts and cities in Indonesia.   
  Recognizing that tackling stunting requires a complex and multisectoral effort that spans all levels of government, the strategy aims to ensure better coordination and resource allocation across national, regional, and local governments.  
  StraNas Stunting has three main priorities:   
  1. Nutrition-specific interventions for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and children under two years of age   
  2. Nutrition-sensitive interventions that include water and sanitation, social insurance and assistance, awareness, behavior change, caring practices, and food and agriculture  
  3. Intervention convergence that focuses on enabling agencies for planning and coordination  
  Although the interventions succeeded in reducing stunting levels by 3.1% – from 30.8% in 2018 to 27.7% in 2019 – it’s still far from the World Health Organization’s target of below 20%. In some regions like East Nusa Tenggara, which observed stunting in  43%    of kids below five years old, the numbers are still quite high.  
    
     
  Digital contribution  
  In 2015, with technical support from the World Bank, Indonesia’s National Government Internal Auditor and Ministry of Home Affairs rolled out the Village Financial System (Siskeudes).   
  Siskeudes is an information system that enables the detailed tracking and analysis of village spending down to the activity level. It will be critical to the government’s anti-stunting efforts and will monitor how villages prioritize spending across and within the relevant sectors.   
  Before 2019, village budgets could not be consolidated and assessed as a whole, as there was no unified village-level chart and village budgets were not systematically stored digitally. Complete budget and expenditure data will be available through Siskeudes by the second half of 2020.  
  Besides tracking village spending, the Indonesian government is trying to strengthening the frontline in the form of hiring “human development workers.”   
  These workers are geared with an Android-based application, eHDW, which can map basic services in the village and register priority households, diagnose access constraints, and monitor the convergence of nutrition interventions. The app also offers an array of training and knowledge materials, task management, and data collection tools.   
  With it, village development planning can now be based on regular and frequently updated data. The reports from these human development workers will also make it easier for the government to allocate funds to the ones that need it the most.  
 CONCLUSION 
  Stunting is a complex problem; it not only concerns nutrition but also involves sanitation, education, economic level, among other factors. From a bigger perspective, this means communities can make a big impact on ensuring that the quality of future human capital is secured.  
  Entrepreneurs, with their specific expertise in technology and infrastructure, can help support the government’s agenda to reach every corner of the nation.   
  Being involved in reducing childhood stunting is not only an act of charity, but it’s also an investment. And the returns are significant – every dollar invested in nutrition yields up to  US$48    in higher income, which will undoubtedly benefit entrepreneurs in the future.

652880,"Asia’s startup scene is on the rise, but Covid-19 may choke its growth: report"," Asia Pacific’s startup economy is going through a “major transition” amid the increasing democratization of tech across the globe, a study from advisory and research firm Startup Genome and Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN) suggests. 
 According to the  2020 Global Startup Ecosystem Report , access to the tech economy is at an all-time high, as seen in the rising number of tech unicorns – startups valued at US$1 billion or higher. 
 In 2013, when the term “unicorn” was popularized by Aileen Lee from CowboyVC, only four tech hubs worldwide produced firms with that valuation. Now, over 80 ecosystems have at least one startup that’s worth US$1 billion. 
 The report shows that Asia Pacific emerged as one of the major beneficiaries of this democratization, as the region has gone from having 20% of the world’s top startup ecosystems in 2012 to 30% this year. 
   
 There are some significant movements that can be observed in this year’s top 30 global startup ecosystems. For one, Seoul and Tokyo – two R&amp;D powerhouses – have broken into the rankings. China, meanwhile, has four cities in the top 30: Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. The country only had two cities in the list three years ago. 
 In India, Delhi joined Bangalore in the top 30, while Melbourne made it to the list as a runner-up to Sydney. 
 This gives Singapore and Hong Kong, two markets that continue to perform well, more regional competitors. 
 The Covid-19 pandemic, however, has presented a new set of problems that could stifle this growth. 
 “If we were publishing this report in December 2019, our reporting on the state of the global startup economy might have stopped there,” the report notes. “But the Covid-19-triggered economic crisis has hit – the worst global downturn since 1929 – and the startup economy is being severely affected by it.” 
 According to data from Startup Genome and GEN, the crisis hit startups hard on two fronts: capital and demand. 
 Right now, there is a capital crunch around the world – the study found that four out of every 10 startups have only three months or fewer of capital runway. If these firms can’t raise additional funding, they may collapse within that timeframe. 
 Investors have also been more cautious this time around, leading to three out of every four startups having their fundraising process disrupted. This includes startups that already had term sheets from investors before the pandemic hit. Total VC funding has also dropped dramatically across the globe, falling by 20% in the first three months of 2020. 
 Four out of every 10 startups have only three months or fewer of capital runway. 
 On the demand side, the report showed that roughly 72% of startups saw their revenue drop since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the average startup seeing a 32% decline. 
 Because of these shock waves, over 60% of startups have resorted to laying off employees or reducing salaries to compensate. These job cuts were prevalent across various functions, from direct sales and marketing to R&amp;D and engineering. 
 For startups to overcome and recover from this crisis, the global tech economy will need to play a crucial role, the study suggests. Citing research from Kauffman and the Stanford Graduate School of Business, the report says most of the net job creation in the economy comes from newer companies. 
 To supplement this, governments must support startups and bail them out, similar to what they did for more traditional businesses. Startup jobs have also been cheaper for government programs to save compared to traditional small business jobs, the report noted. 
 “We need a new normal for economic development, where we are supporting the technology economy just as much as we were supporting traditional small businesses and traditional industries like airlines,” the report urges. “Ecosystems need to invest now to not lose the progress made in the past 10 years.” ",Miguel Cordon,0,3,"[(0, 0.10727556), (2, 0.8925845)]",['GEN'],"['Singapore', 'Shanghai', 'Bangalore', 'Shenzhen', 'Seoul', 'Delhi', 'Sydney', 'India', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'China', 'Hangzhou']"
652828,This startup is leveling the playing field for forex trading," Singapore is the  third-largest foreign exchange (forex) trading center in the world , trailing behind the UK and the US, with an average daily trading volume of US$633 billion. 
 Despite that, the actual matching of trades – where buyers are connected to sellers and vice versa – doesn’t happen in the city-state. Trades are matched only in London, New York, and Tokyo. 
 Because of this and due to latency hopping, executing buy-and-sell orders and then confirming that they have been done takes significantly longer for buyers and sellers who aren’t based in those cities. 
 “To send an order to buy or sell from Singapore to London or New York takes about 180 milliseconds. Then, you need to know whether the order was successfully done or not, and the time taken to receive a reply is another 180 milliseconds,” says Wong Joo Seng, CEO and co-founder of Singapore-based forex platform  Spark Systems . “But if we were to match trades in Singapore, we could reduce the time from 360 milliseconds to just 1 millisecond.” 
 A way to democratize forex trading 
 Though 360 milliseconds may not sound like a lot of time, it makes all the difference when forex markets become volatile due to major Western events such as Brexit or presidential elections in the US. 
 “It becomes very difficult to transact,” says Wong. “By the time you see a buying price here and try to execute that, parties in London and New York that are much closer and have a much quicker execution time would have the advantage, while everyone based here would be at a disadvantage.” 
 Wong’s desire to make Singapore a major trading center inspired him to launch Spark Systems in 2016. The platform operates at low latencies, enabling local hedge funds, banks, and brokerages to execute trades on the platform at high speeds.

 According to the founder, this isn’t just a boon to traders in Singapore: Buyers and sellers from neighboring countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and the rest of Southeast Asia are also able to execute trades at much faster speeds. 
 On top of its low-latency capabilities, Spark Systems’ “next-generation” platform is also cheaper to use compared to other forex platforms, most of which, Wong says, were built in the early 2000s. 
 “I used to trade about US$2 trillion a year on average and I earned an income of US$25 million in revenue, but paid US$10 million of that to trading platforms,” he recalls. “I felt that 40 cents on every dollar I earned on revenue was a very high transaction cost.” 
 With Spark Systems, Wong says firms can save 50% on bills that cost millions of dollars, when trading volumes are in the billions and trillions. 
 Bringing in the banks 
 But building Spark Systems’ platform wasn’t easy. Wong credits part of the company’s success to its collaboration with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which, like Spark Systems, had the vision of further developing Singapore into a forex trading hub. 
 The partnership saw the startup engaging reputable banks to set up forex operations in Singapore. MAS would then defray the cost for these banks to operate locally as an incentive for them to set up in the city-state. 
 We’re almost there, we need maybe just another two or three more [banks]. Then, the floodgates will open. 
 According to Wong, the move surprised the banks, with some even approaching him to verify MAS’s defrayment of their costs because “they hadn’t seen this kind of offer anywhere else.” 
 After a year of conversations, Union Bank of Switzerland was the first bank to agree. Within months, several others came on board as well. 
 “We’re almost there, we need maybe just another two or three more [banks],” says Wong. “Then, the floodgates will open and Singapore will become a major center for banks to trade forex.” 
 Getting recognition 
 Spark Systems’ association with MAS has lent it a lot of credibility as a legitimate forex player, which is due especially to the latter being regarded as “one of the most respected central banks in the world.” 
 “That was how a young company with very little corporate reputation gained some kind of gravitas and standing within the international community,” adds Wong. 
 Another way Spark Systems sought to gain a good reputation as a forex platform was to participate in the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s  SG:D Techblazer Awards , Singapore’s highest accolade for tech innovation. Singapore’s highest accolade for tech innovation. Spark Systems won the Bronze Award in the Most Promising Innovation category in SG:D Techblazer Awards 2019.

 “It gave us massive publicity in a very positive way and helped get our name out there,” Wong says. He adds that without the award, public recognition would have been difficult to achieve because of the company’s business-to-business nature. “The only people who knew us were specialists and expert users of forex.” 
 Wong also says that participating in the Techblazer Awards was helpful in validating Spark Systems’ business model and the tech behind its platform. 
 “It was one of the awards that looked very closely at the company, not just at the peripheral of what the company wants to do,” he says. “It also looked into how well we’ve been doing, when our product was built, how much traction we got, what kind of volumes we were seeing – and those were very important questions.” 
 Participation in such awards can be very helpful, Wong adds, especially for fledgling businesses looking to make a name for themselves. 
 “Gaining visibility is part and parcel of growing a young company,” he concludes. 
 
 The SG:D Techblazer Awards is Singapore’s highest accolade for tech innovation. It aims to recognize and endorse companies based in the city-state that exemplify the spirit of innovation in the development of tech solutions.

652876,Singlife tripled revenue and widened losses in 2019,"   ﻿   
  
 ||item|| 
 Digital life insurance company  Singlife , previously known as Singapore Life, achieved US$171 million in total income in 2019, up from US$54 million in the year prior. 
 Most of its income came from gross premiums, which contributed US$104 million. Premiums ceded to reinsurers – or companies that provide financial protection to insurers – also went to US$35 million in 2019 from negative US$72 million in 2018. 
 Explaining this change, a Singlife spokesperson told  Tech in Asia : “Singlife deployed reinsurance structures previously to optimize its capital position and offer better value to customers. These structures were no longer required in 2019 as Singlife’s capital base grew rapidly, and so the figures reflect the unwinding of these contracts.” 
  Founded in 2014 , Singlife aims to transform the insurance space by allowing customers to view policy information through a mobile device, sign up online, get covered “in minutes” with customized coverage and policy features, and receive real-time quotations. 
 It received regulatory approval in 2017, becoming the first new local life insurer to be licensed in Singapore in nearly 50 years. 
 FUNDING AND EXPANSIONS 
 Its financials will be closely watched for how the digitalization of the insurance industry can benefit the bottom line. 
 Last year, the company secured US$90 million from Japan’s Sumitomo Life, bringing its total capital to  US$153 million . At that time, Singlife CEO Walter de Oude claimed that his company was valued at  US$358 million . 
 It now aims to broaden the range of its offerings, as de Oude  believes  that verticals between financial services are “blurring.” “We see insurers being able to operate in the asset management world. We see neobanks and stored value cards operating in a banking world,” he says. 
 He also previously said that the company looks to expand across Southeast Asia and acquire other startups to capture a larger share of the financial services market. 
 In order to do that, it partnered with Aboitiz Equity Ventures and Singapore’s investment firm Di-Firm to launch a joint venture last year in the Philippines called Singlife Philippines. The new entity received its license to operate in the country in early 2020, then formed its first couple of partnerships with local neobank EON and mobile wallet GCash, which has more than 20 million registered users and 63,000 partner merchants as of last year, according to its website. 
 Singlife Philippines looks to leverage the user bases of its two local partners to roll out its services in the country. “These are customers with increasing wealth who are looking for more digital ways to protect their finances and make their money work harder,” the spokesperson for Singlife told  Tech in Asia . 
 Singlife now has 38 team members in the Philippines and 78 in Singapore. 
 Apart from expanding in the Philippines, the company  acquired  Visa prepaid card issuer Canvas from local payments platform Yolopay last year to step into the prepaid card space. 
 It also rolled out an insurance savings plan called Singlife Account in partnership with Visa. The renewable life insurance plan lets customers earn returns of 2.5% per annum on their first S$10,000 (US$7,200). The company said the new service has already seen more than S$150 million (US$108 million) in savings within the first three months of launch. 
    
  
 With that, Singlife’s total assets in 2019 hit US$364 million, with investments doubling to US$256 million. This component comprises pre-purchased assets to back the company’s Singlife Account liabilities and assets purchased from premiums received, Singlife said. 
 PROFIT AND LOSS 
 However, the company recorded US$27 million in total comprehensive loss last year after recording US$1 million in profit in 2018. 
    
  
 Singlife’s costs and expenses also jumped to US$219 million in 2019 from US$49 million in 2018, with change in insurance contract liabilities contributing US$172 million. De Oude previously defined insurance contract liabilities as “best estimate reserves that we need to set up to pay future benefits to customers.” 
 The change this time was driven by a combination of the company’s “growth and the unwinding of its reinsurance structures,” the Singlife spokesperson told  Tech in Asia.  
 “Our rapid growth in recent years naturally increases liabilities, but the fall in interest rates seen in 2019 has also led to an increase in reserving, which our accounts reflect. We see this as being a one-off event that shouldn’t have any prolonged impact,” the person added. 
 Singlife said it has a  capital adequacy ratio  in excess of 200% and will continue to raise capital to fuel its growth. 
    
  
 The company’s total liabilities also went up to US$227 million during the year, mainly due to increased gross insurance contract liabilities, which amounted to US$217 million. 
    
     
 ANOTHER GROWTH YEAR? 
 Looking ahead, Singlife sees 2020 as another growth year as it scales Singlife Account and expands further across the region. 
 Although Covid-19 forced the company to change its go-to-market strategies, Singlife said it didn’t affect its core processes to operate in a socially distanced world. 
 “Digital has always been in our DNA, from offering a mobile and web insurance journey to our financial advisors who can provide our products to customers remotely. This includes remote signing of application forms, which is transformational for the industry,” it shared. 
 According to a recent report by management consulting firm McKinsey and Company, awareness for health insurance increased amid the pandemic, resulting in  17%  sales growth from Q1 2019 to Q1 2020. However, life products declined by 1% over the said period, while demand for auto and liabilities policies “slowed dramatically.” 
 Moreover, digital players were less affected by the crisis in general compared to traditional insurers. Tencent’s insurance platform WeSure, for example, added 25 million active users during the pandemic. 
 “Agents increasingly find digital platforms an effective medium for communicating and doing business with customers. And customers are becoming more comfortable with using digital channels. As such, we anticipate permanent change in this direction,” says the McKinsey report.

652545,Meet the startup that’s bringing healthcare costs down and making AI accessible," Imagine having a clear understanding of all the variables at play every time you have to make a big life decision. Things would be much simpler, wouldn’t they? 
 This would be particularly beneficial when it comes to physical wellbeing, especially since choosing to avail of healthcare  is a problem for many people in Southeast Asia  because of the associated risks and costs. 
 Even those who could afford the best treatment and amenities sometimes find it prudent to opt for a cheaper procedure. Ultimately, it comes down to individual preferences. 
 Unfortunately, that’s where the issue of  unknown unknowns  comes in. 
 “It’s very challenging to assess the risk and cost for individuals,” says Neal Liu, founder and CTO of  uCare AI , a startup that helps reduce medical costs and maximize efficiency.

 Reducing uncertainties in healthcare 
 According to Liu, while large healthcare organizations have access to population-based data that enables them to put together sound overarching guidelines that shape healthcare recommendations, things become much more complex at the individual consumer level. “There are all the health policies that try to help manage the cost,” he says. “But there are always outliers. How can we make sure that all the processes and policies are able to include them?” 
 For uCare AI, the answer lies in building predictive analytics models that are able to solve these challenges in a more comprehensive manner. 
 Specifically, the company is keen on using machine learning models and AI to forecast the future. “Given all the historical data, how can we look forward and make predictions from the risk and cost angles?” Liu points out. 
 Quality and quantity of data are fuel for effective AI development, and it’s no different in uCare AI’s case. In 2018, the startup established a partnership with  Parkway Pantai , one of Asia’s largest integrated private healthcare providers that, prior to working with uCare AI, used to generate bill estimates through traditional statistical models. Because it was expensive to keep refreshing these estimates, they were updated infrequently, resulting in higher error rates. 
 Using the wealth of patient and medical data Parkway has, uCare AI built a predictive model to determine specific treatment options and the related costs. “If I get admitted to a hospital, the model will take all the various inputs from my unique profile to recommend a specific treatment and cost to me,” Liu explains. “This is better than just knowing the average cost for a typical male of my age, and I can make a much more informed decision.” 
 Parkway deployed this cost prediction solution to all four of its Singapore hospitals in November 2018. Since then, it has performed at an  average aggregate accuracy of 82% . Confident in this prediction model, Parkway launched a price guarantee program in December 2019, which ensures that patients will be charged the initial price quoted by the cost predictor, even if additional treatments are added later in the process. This helps patients get a clear and early view of the finances involved. 
 It’s something that Liu is “super jazzed about,” because “it’s a huge step forward, and if we can start managing these risks and costs in a more transparent way, you could even buy insurance on the spot in the future.” 
 Using AI to help people make smarter decisions 
 The founder is thinking beyond just medical care, however. The goal is to use AI to help people make better lifestyle choices and have them think beyond the short term with more clarity. 
 “When I was young, I would eat a large pizza and wash it down with a huge bottle of soda,” the 50-year-old Liu says. “You know how bad that is for you, right? But with the immediate satisfaction I got out of it, I was like, ‘Hey, I’m good!’ But there are obviously consequences down the stream.” 
 The key lies in making AI accessible and transparent. Accessibility helps lower the barrier of entry, bringing in more AI talent into a market starved for them. Transparency, meanwhile, helps people from outside the AI field understand how it works, encouraging adoption rates. 
 Additionally, the data upon which models are built have to be both securely handled – with the appropriate security processes in place – and easy to train. 
 “We make it a point to have a human in the loop,” Liu adds. “We always seek the domain experts’ advice to make sure that we aren’t shortchanging ourselves in terms of how we’re looking at the data.” 
 UCare AI is bringing these principles together with  AlgoBox , a cloud-based platform that allows users to easily train, develop, and deploy new AI models. 
 “AlgoBox works by establishing a baseline of machine learning operations,” Liu explains. “It can deploy production-ready models within three months, end-to-end, with 99.9% uptime.” In order to keep the model flexible even with drastic changes in parameters, the platform also enables continuous monitoring and learning of AI models in real-world deployment.

 Liu brings up the Covid-19 pandemic as an example. “Cost and risk models are drastically different due to changes in treatment protocols,” he says. “Previously, a patient with symptoms of fever, cough, or runny nose would go through a simple outpatient visit. With the pandemic, doctors now need to administer more tests and monitor a patient closely to determine if there is a Covid-19 infection or not, which drives up costs.” 
 With AlgoBox, a data scientist can refresh and retrain the deployed models as they observe these data and model drifts to make sure they continue to work and behave as they are expected to. 
 Leaving a social impact 
 Looking ahead, uCare AI is collaborating with more partners to expand to other industries, starting with health insurance, which is a natural extension to its work in healthcare. Working with different stakeholders across the ecosystem and having access to their data stores also help the startup improve its model. 
 At a fundamental level, however, Liu is driven to use technology to make a positive difference in people’s lives. As the self-styled technologist puts it, “Only two things matter when you’re older: How much money you have for your retirement, and whether you’re healthy enough to enjoy it.” This motivated him to enter the healthcare industry, even with all the restrictions and challenges the field faces with technology and data. 
 “Machine learning and AI are so disruptive, we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg,” he says. “I would love to get more people excited about them because of the potential impact this technology can make on mankind. I want to bring together like-minded people and let them know that we can do wonders here.”

652631,Alibaba-backed Xpeng Motors bags $500m in series C+ round," China’s smart electric vehicle company  Xpeng Motors , also known as Xiaopeng Motors, has raised around US$500 million in a series C+ funding round from Hillhouse Capital, Sequoia Capital China, Aspex, and Coatue.

 Founded in 2015, Xpeng designs and manufactures EVs and aims to become the leading smart EV player in China. The Guangzhou-headquartered company has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Silicon Valley, and San Diego. 
 According to the firm, the new capital injection will go toward its expenses on product development, manufacturing, sales, and service network, among others. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  The company said it experienced some supply chain issues in the first quarter of the year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. And with brick-and-mortar stores closed, Xpeng had to turn to online channels such as ByteDance’s TikTok, Twitter-like Weibo, and WeChat, among others, to reach its customers. 
 In general, car sales in China also slumped amid the pandemic. According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, sales for new energy vehicles from January to May declined by nearly  40%  year on year. 
 As China’s economy begins to recover, however, the market is starting to improve. The government is also aiming to make new energy vehicle sales account for a quarter of the country’s total car sales by 2025. 
 With that, the EV market in China remains highly competitive with players like Tencent-backed Nio, Didi Chuxing, and US-based Tesla gunning for a bigger slice of the pie. 
 In April, Nio secured US$1 billion from several state-run capital firms, while ride-hailing giant Didi raised  US$500 million  in a SoftBank-led round in its bid to launch autonomous fleet operations. 
 Foreign player Tesla, meanwhile, accounts for over  20%  of the total market share, selling  11,095  vehicles in China in May. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  As of March, Xpeng has more than 140 shops in 48 cities in China, the company told  Tech in Asia . 
 In April, it launched its second smart EV model, the P7 sports sedan, deemed a rival to Tesla Model 3. It also secured the production license for its self-built, fully owned factory in Zhaoqing in Guangdong province in May.

652723,Can AirAsia’s super-app ambitions take off?," Whether it’s ecommerce, digital payments, travel, or online media, you name it, AirAsia’s in it. 
 While the airline very much remains its core business, the AirAsia Group’s 17 business lines, ranging from fintech to e-commerce and food delivery, speak to its sprawling “super app” ambitions.

 “We want to be the one-stop-shop portal to satisfy all consumer needs…You can fly, stay, shop, eat, chat – all from the convenience of one app,” Karen Chan, CEO of AirAsia.com, said at  Tech in Asia ’s Product Development Conference last week. 
 AirAsia’s pivot comes amid an unprecedented crisis that has brought the travel industry to its knees. While the company had the foresight to diversify from its core business  well before the pandemic hit , it’s now running against the clock. 
 With travel demand just a fraction of what it was, the carrier has reported 803.3 million ringgit (US$187.9 million) in net losses from January to March, its  biggest first-quarter loss  since November 2004. 
 And despite the reopening of domestic routes, AirAsia’s external auditor Ernst &amp; Young has said “ material uncertainties ” exist, which may cast doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a  going concern . 
 Global passenger travel is not expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels  until the end of 2023 . As such, the success of AirAsia’s super-app ambitions will depend on the company’s ability to raise money to tide itself through this period. If it does work out, AirAsia could become a textbook example of how asset-heavy corporations can spin off new internet businesses. 
 While the notion of an airline-based super app might sound unusual, it’s actually not that far-fetched, as airlines are already more multifaceted than people might think: They’re transportation, logistics, F&amp;B, media, and retail businesses rolled into one.

 What AirAsia hopes to do is to take these units and extend them beyond the airplane. 
 Imagine travelers booking a flight to Malaysia through AirAsia.com and getting recommendations for holiday packages and  hotel bundles  as well. 
 Upon landing, they can order nasi lemak made by AirAsia’s F&amp;B brand Santan through GrabFood or buy fresh carrots from ecommerce site  Ourshop , paying through AirAsia’s in-house e-wallet  BigPay . In the process, they collect  BIGLife loyalty points  that they can then use to offset costs in future flights or purchases. Finally, they receive their orders at their doorsteps via logistics service  Teleport . 
 Ride hailing from the air 
 AirAsia challenges one’s notions of what a super app is – which, in most of Asia, is often tied to ride hailing. “What’s really interesting is that if you look at the other super apps in ASEAN, they are anchored around ground mobility. AirAsia.com is grounded on air mobility,” Chan says. 
 Super apps Grab and Gojek have built a massive distribution network of users, drivers, and merchants through their core ride-hailing services: Grab has  187 million  mobile downloads to date, while Gojek has  36.3 million monthly active users  across the region.

 AirAsia boasts a respectable user base as well: Before the pandemic, it was flying 100 million passengers annually, Chan says. Every month, over 40 million users visit AirAsia.com for flights and travel-related searches, she adds. 
 But with flight bookings down during the pandemic, the challenge now is to drive non-travel related lifestyle searches on the platform, whether for food or online shopping. It’s a limitation that’s specific to air mobility. “Our business model is high-average basket value, high affinity, but low velocity: not that much frequency, [just] maybe four to five times a year,” Chan notes. 
 However, the CEO is hopeful that recent pushes into expanding its non-airline offerings will change that. 
 
  Non-airline revenue for AirAsia grew 189% between FY 2018 and FY 2019 / Source: AirAsia Investor Deck, April 2020 
 
 Its non-airline businesses have been growing fast: Between 2018 and 2019, non-airline revenue grew by 189% to 697 million ringgit (US$161.7 million). They’re still relatively nascent, though, bringing in only around a fifth of the total group revenue. 
 Teleport-ing to profitability 
 Underscoring the difficulty of making ground in the highly competitive verticals of ecommerce, fintech, and food delivery are the losses incurred last year by almost all of AirAsia’s non-airline verticals, despite the significant growth they achieved. The only exception? Its logistics arm Teleport. 
 Teleport, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AirAsia’s corporate venture arm RedBeat Ventures, recorded positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of 239 million ringgit (US$55.9 million) – an almost tenfold increase from 2018, its first year of operations. 
 It stands out against RedBeat Ventures’ portfolio of unprofitable ventures, which include AirAsia.com, BigPay, and quick-service restaurant brand Santan – all of which were in the red last year. 
    
     
 Cross-border air cargo services like Teleport are mainstays in many airlines, but AirAsia’s edge lies in its unique routes, Chan points out. “Over 25% of our routes are unique, which means AirAsia is the only carrier that can upload cargo and deliver parcels to customers in remote provinces, covering both first-mile and last-mile.” The airline runs  388 routes  across the region. 
 However, cross-border air cargo hasn’t been spared by Covid-19 either. In May, SIA Cargo, the air cargo operations unit of Singapore’s national carrier, reported a  52.8% year-on-year decline  in cargo traffic, measured in freight tonne kilometers, while Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific saw its cargo and mail revenue  fall by 29.1%  year on year. 
 Amid movement restriction orders imposed in Malaysia since March, Teleport is expanding from  middle-mile logistics , with AirAsia launching the last-mile ecommerce logistics solutions Ourshop and Ourfresh, as well as food delivery platform Ourfood, to take advantage of the rise in demand for grocery and food deliveries.

 Teleport has also launched same-day and next-day parcel delivery services, with the latter expected to eventually reach customers across  10 cities and 3 countries . 
 “Within two-months, we pivoted our ecommerce, travel, retail platform from selling perfume and cosmetics to [selling] potatoes and carrots,” Chan explains. 
 Since the start of the pandemic, AirAsia has onboarded 3,000 merchants, from peanut butter to durian suppliers. “For a lot of these entrepreneurs, it’s actually their first time [becoming] e-tailers,” Chan says, adding that the company helps them produce digital assets and even does photoshoots of their products. 
 Whether it’s intentional or not, it’s clear that merchants are becoming an increasing focus for AirAsia – and, by extension, Teleport. 
 Ourfarm is an agriculture platform that links up local farmers and fisheries directly to businesses across Southeast Asia through the ground mobility support of 7,000 drivers and excess “belly space” on AirAsia flights. As of June, it has  45 local farmers and poultry breeders  on board, serving the Klang valley. While deliveries of fruits, vegetables, meat, and fish are currently limited to the Kuala Lumpur area, Ourfarm’s service is expected to expand to the cities of Sabah and Sarawak, as well as neighboring Singapore, in the next three to four months. 
 Teleport is riding the online shopping wave. Malaysia’s ecommerce industry, which exceeded US$3 billion in gross merchandise value in 2019, is expected to hit US$11 billion by 2025, according to a  2019 report  by Google and Temasek. But rising ecommerce demands have created a need for more well-oiled logistics services, and Teleport will find stiff competition from the likes of J&amp;T Express and Ninja Van. 
 It’s unclear what AirAsia’s ambitions for small merchants are, but Grab’s creation of a dedicated GrabMerchant platform could be a good blueprint. The ride-hailing company’s suite of services includes sourcing of wholesale supplies, creating advertisements, business analytics, and setting up cashless payments, and will soon include access to financial services. It claims to have  onboarded 78,000 merchants  to its platform between March and April this year. 
 The AirAsia.com advantage 
 While Teleport is the proven moneymaker among AirAsia’s non-airline businesses, AirAsia.com is the lightning rod. Someone who has shopped on Ourshop or has had food delivered through Ourfood has probably flown AirAsia previously, and AirAsia.com is likely the company’s single most important driver of traffic; according to Chan, 80% of traffic on the site is organic. 
 “You won’t have a guy who’s never flown on AirAsia, never heard of it, and [yet] decides to use one of its existing services,” says Mohshin Aziz, an aviation consultant. 
 AirAsia.com is now leaning more heavily into its traffic-generating role. Last year, it started offering  flights by external airlines  through a white-label partnership with online travel platform Kiwi.com. This opened up bookings to destinations not served by AirAsia, such as London, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Auckland.

 It’s also stepped up to offer  bundled hotel and holiday packages  and deals, putting it in direct competition with activity bookings site Klook, as well as Airbnb and regional OTA Traveloka, both of which have launched travel experience bookings. 
 But unlike its competitors, AirAsia concurrently operates an airline, giving it visibility over data on various flights and routes, Chan notes. This allows the airline to bundle unsold seats together with hotel packages at highly discounted rates in the market, thereby maximizing revenue on each flight. 
 “Even when we sell some of our seats at a loss, we can make it up in the total average basket value [expected over a customer’s lifetime],” she explains, giving AirAsia extra leeway in undercutting its competitors through lowered ticket pricing. 
 Though not yet profitable, AirAsia.com is growing. Revenue grew by more than threefold to 11.1 million ringgit (US$2.6 million) in the fourth quarter of last year, while gross booking value was 5.5 billion ringgit (US$1.3 billion) in the same period, up 15% year on year. 
 While air travel has been hit by the pandemic, AirAsia is expecting a recovery in air ticket sales as movement curbs ease. Spurred by pent-up travel fever, consumers from Malaysia and Thailand have snapped up over 200,000 of  AirAsia’s unlimited travel passes , a new product that was launched in February. 
 The website’s new services will leverage both of the company’s airline and logistics businesses. By the end of August, AirAsia.com will launch an end-to-end online medical tourism platform that can handle everything from flight and hotel bookings and on-ground logistics to the booking of hospitals and medical treatments – including post-medical treatment and recovery – for prospective patients and their families. 
 Another new venture in the pipeline is Ikhlas, a Muslim travel and lifestyle portal that will feature Hajj travel options and Halal-certified consumer products on an ecommerce marketplace. 
 Keeping food delivery lean 
  Food delivery  is another area that AirAsia is playing in. 
 It’s worth noting the two food delivery models at play here. The first is Santan, a model similar to  Grain ’s and  Dahmakan ’s cloud kitchens. Santan also operates two physical restaurants in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. While the fulfillment of orders are partly handled by Teleport, Santan has also roped in GrabFood and same-day delivery platform  MrSpeedy  as delivery partners.

 A  cloud kitchen  is a type of restaurant business that’s optimized for deliveries instead of dining in. Since cloud kitchens don’t need to be in a vicinity with high foot traffic, their rental costs are significantly reduced and gross margins are higher. In Singapore, that can save a business anywhere between “6x to 15x in terms of rent,” Grain co-founder Yi Sung Yong told  Tech in Asia  in May. 
 On top of that, Santan has a couple of additional advantages. First – and this is not always apparent – is that airlines are also F&amp;B businesses, since they serve in-flight food. 
 AirAsia runs its own kitchens, and these economies of scale and expertise can help it grow its restaurant business; the company already made  around US$20 million in revenue  from in-flight sales of food and beverages in 2017. 
 Now, if AirAsia can succeed in getting these same diners to buy its food from the comfort of their homes, simple estimates by  Tech in Asia  show that this could create meaningful revenue that approaches Teleport’s figures. 
    
     
 Another advantage for Santan is that it has the B2B agriculture platform Ourfarm as its main source of fresh produce, which further lowers the cost of procurement – one of the biggest overheads of any F&amp;B establishment. It’s likely that AirAsia wields its substantial bargaining power to obtain favorable wholesale rates that can boost margins in every order. 
 In addition to a cloud kitchen business, AirAsia also runs Ourfood, a restaurant aggregator or marketplace similar to Foodpanda, GrabFood, and Deliveroo. As of June, the platform has  36 F&amp;B merchants . 
 Taken as a whole, AirAsia’s model avoids the  pitfalls of the food delivery business , a thin-margin endeavor where profits are dependent on a multitude of factors such as city density, labor costs, and the efficiency of the driver fleet. Despite years in the business, Uber and GrubHub have yet to make a profit, and so does  Grab in Thailand . 
 In comparison, Santan leans toward a full-stack business that could own every aspect of its operations, except for the farms where its ingredients come from. 
 
  Santan’s hybrid model could have better margins / Table: Tech in Asia 
 
 Of course, airline food has the reputation of being unappetizing, which means it might be tough to convince consumers to give Santan a try. 
 That said, given the upheaval that Covid-19 has brought to the restaurant industry, it may just find an opening. 
 “What we will see is a lot of F&amp;B brands slowly thinking about innovating, moving away from traditional retail to focus more on delivery, whether by offering delivery through their retail spaces or moving into cloud kitchens where there’s a lot less overhead. They can be a little bit more experimental,” says Jessica Li, chief operating officer at Dahmakan. 
 Betting big on BigPay 
 No super app will be complete without its own e-wallet – or at least, that’s the prevailing wisdom. AirAsia’s BigPay, which reached over a million downloads as of Q4 2019, still has to battle the likes of Alibaba and  Touch ‘n Go’s  e-wallet, the telecommunications giant Axiata-owned  Boost , and GrabPay. 
 As of January this year,  only 5%  of total daily payments in Malaysia were cashless, according to Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng, with cash transaction still the preferred mode for paying for groceries, parking, and newspapers. 
 Against such resistance, fintech players need all the help they can get. Last December, the Ministry of Finance Malaysia distributed 30 ringgit (US$7) among Malaysians who were at least 18 years of age and earn less than 100,000 ringgit (US$23,400) annually as part of the  e-Tunai Rakyat initiative , aimed at increasing digital adoption in the country.

  Three e-wallets  were selected as part of the scheme: Touch ‘n Go, Boost and GrabPay; BigPay was shut out. 
 “Through this initiative, we saw over 70% of claimants spending on our ecosystem of services, and over 50% of users [remained] active on GrabPay even after the  movement control order  [was relaxed],” says Huey Tyng Ooi, managing director of GrabPay. 
 Boost, Touch ‘n Go, and GrabPay are expected to benefit from continued government support through schemes such as the  short-term economic recovery plan (PENJAYA) , where the three are participating merchants. Government co-funded programs enable digital players to offer discounts that entice customers to spend via digital means. Grab, for instance, is offering  50% off on orders  on GrabMart and GrabFood via the “Shop Malaysia Online” campaign, and 2,000 ringgit (US$470) to brick-and-mortar merchants that sign up on the platforms. 
 As for BigPay, it will have to continue to fund steep subsidies – whether in the form of discounts or cashbacks – out-of-pocket in order to stay competitive. It is expected to “continue to incur expansion costs as it acquires market share,” according to company guidance  as of December . 
 Indeed, despite claiming to be the largest e-money issuer in Malaysia in terms of transactional volume, BigPay was a loss-making business last year, recording a negative EBITDA of 78.8 million ringgit (US$18.5 million). Transaction volumes on BigPay were not made available to  Tech in Asia . 
    
     
 According to a third-party industry estimate, BigPay had less than a quarter of the number of Boost’s monthly active users, and less than one-eighth of Touch ‘n Go’s. 
 It’s worth noting that while the Touch ‘n Go e-wallet, a joint venture between TNG Digital and Ant Financial, has the largest active user base, most of its transactions are payments done on toll expressways and highways rather than for lifestyle purchases. However, it has recently diversified into parking, theme parks, and selected retail outlets, and is also one of the accepted payment options on Lazada. 
 But the “quality” of an e-wallet’s user base might also matter more than just its sheer size. BigPay’s user base, which consists of travelers, is arguably more affluent than its competitors’, as they are willing to spend on plane tickets. Compared to “other mobility [players],” the average basket transaction size of an AirAsia customer is “five to eight times higher,” Chan claims. 
    
     
 But the total lifetime value of a customer is a function of both average transaction values and frequency. “A chatting app may be used 40 times a day, taxi and food apps four times a day, a travel app one time per quarter – but the average value of transaction will be different across all of them,” says Varun Mittal, emerging market fintech leader at consultancy Ernst &amp; Young. 
 In reality, higher-cost purchases, like those spent on flight tickets, take place less frequently than cab rides. Therefore, the task for AirAsia is to get its customers to use BigPay more frequently. 
    
     
 BigPay has set its sights beyond just digital and local payments, though. It already offers a remittance service, allowing users to send money from their BigPay accounts to bank accounts in countries such as Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia, at real exchange rates. 
 An accompanying BigPay Mastercard essentially allows customers to spend at over 40,000 Mastercard-accepting merchants worldwide, whereas Boost’s and Touch ‘n Go’s services are limited to Malaysia. 
 And similar to UK-based fintech company Revolut, BigPay also offers users visibility on their spending patterns. 
 The point of running an e-wallet isn’t necessarily to make a profit. Rather, it is to accumulate transactional data that offers insights into consumers, which can then be fed into advertising algorithms or used as credit scoring for loans. In fact, BigPay’s “next big launch” will be its  credit and lending facilities , BigPay CEO Chris Davison revealed in January, though a date is yet to be set. 
 You get into this predicament: Are you an airline or a tech company? 
 AirAsia is reportedly in the running for a  digital banking license in Malaysia , though the company has not confirmed this. Five digital banking licenses are expected to be awarded by Bank Negara, which is expected to finalize the guidelines  later this year . 
 “They are entering into things where there’s still rapid growth and no profits, unfortunately, and everyone is scrambling to become number one. It’s a tough and challenging period to be doing it, and when you want to enter during this stage, you will incur a lot of startup loss,” says Aziz, the aviation analyst. 
 Can this all work? 
 ASEAN’s fragmented market, which has “no dominant player that spans across multiple verticals,” offers AirAsia an opportunity, Chan says. “We already have a unified platform; payments solutions and loyalty points are in place. What we then need to build and scale rapidly is the onboarding of merchants.” 
 While many of AirAsia’s digital initiatives have valid value propositions, successive launches of new services and its sprawling web of apps and sub-products have baffled some consumers and analysts. “You get into this predicament: Are you an airline or a tech company?” asks Aziz. Ourfarm, for instance, is “another fine example of a digital venture that will confuse the analyst community.” 
 But perhaps another question to ask is, can it be both? 
 Before finding the answer to that question, AirAsia has to deal with the magnitude of initial startup losses first, as unlike venture-backed startups, AirAsia’s war chest is reliant on the health of its primary airline business. Grab has  over US$3 billion in reserves , a source told  Reuters . In comparison, AirAsia’s overall losses (before taxes) from its airline and non-airline businesses combined in 2019 was 549.8 million ringgit (US$128.9 million).

 To tide itself through a period of subdued travel demand, the firm has applied for bank loans and has had  ongoing deliberations for joint ventures and collaborations  that might result in additional third-party investments in specific segments of the group’s businesses, Group CEO Tony Fernandes has said. 
 Already, the company has been forced to make  staff cuts  and salary reductions, and a  possible exit from its joint venture in India  is on the cards. 
 There’s also the question of whether its new food delivery and ecommerce offerings will be able to keep users on the platform, in the absence of international air travel. Domestic travel, notably, is picking up, with all domestic routes  expected to restart beginning in July . 
 Despite its efforts to diversify from solely being an “airline,” AirAsia’s success will ultimately hinge on the health of its main business. “Without [the] primary business doing well, and if people are not flying, [AirAsia] is not going to get all these ancillary subservices,” says Aziz.

 However,  Reuters  reported earlier this month that Ant is seeking a valuation of more than US$200 billion in a Hong Kong IPO. When contacted by  KrAsia  on July 8, two Ant Financial spokesmen separately denied the  Reuters  report saying they contain “incorrect information.” 
 “The innovative measures implemented by Shanghai Star market and the Hong Kong stock exchange have opened the doors for global investors to access leading-edge technology companies from the most dynamic economies in the world and for those companies to have greater access to the capital markets,” said executive chairman Eric Jing of Ant, which is 33% owned by Alibaba, in the press release.

652712,Gojek names former Amazon exec as new CTO," Indonesian ride-hailing giant Gojek today announced that it has appointed Severan Rault as its group chief technology officer. 
 The announcement comes after the company’s former CTO Ajey Gore  stepped down  last month to “take a personal break” after serving at Gojek for five years.

 Rault, who’s based in Singapore, will oversee all of the technology behind Gojek’s ecosystem, from transportation and payments to food delivery, logistics, and several other on-demand services. He will also manage the company’s engineering teams across Southeast Asia and India, Gojek said in a statement. 
 Rault joined Gojek earlier this year as head of engineering for the company’s marketplace platform. As the group CTO, he will now report to Gojek co-CEO Kevin Aluwi. 
 “The company is entering a critical phase as it moves from startup to maturation,” Rault said. “The engineering challenges associated with that are fascinating, ranging from the incredible scaling issues that call for the most cutting-edge cloud solutions to the deep application of artificial intelligence technologies.” 
 With over 20 years of experience in the tech industry, Rault was the director of software development at Amazon, where he led the team to found Amazon Prime Air, the company’s drone delivery service. 
 Prior to Amazon, Rault had worked at Microsoft for over four years, serving as the principal architect of search engine Bing and the principal development manager for OneApp, which enables feature phones to run popular mobile apps. 
 He also founded two companies: wireless solutions firm Kikker Interactive, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2008, and virtual reality company Betawave, where he had worked before moving to Gojek.

652665,Tiki-Sendo merger reportedly falls through. What’s next?," Dear readers, 
 Providing in-depth coverage of Vietnam has been on our to-do list for some time – it’s one of the largest markets in Southeast Asia after all. It’s also a country that’s hard to cover if you don’t know the language. 
 Last week, in the debut piece of our Vietnamese journalist, Thu Huong Le, she  analyzed the implications of a much-anticipated merger  between two prominent local ecommerce marketplaces: Sendo and Tiki. 
 We believe it’s an important move: Vietnam’s ecommerce market is a fraction of the size of Indonesia’s and its infrastructure is less developed, too. Sendo and Tiki need to aim their marketing budgets toward closing the gap with Shopee.

 But the Tiki camp is throwing a spanner in the works. As  DealStreetAsia  reported, the company’s most influential shareholder, Chinese ecommerce giant JD.com, is calling off the merger at the 11th hour. The reason: a widening gap between Tiki and Sendo post-Covid-19 in favor of the former. 
 Huong’s analysis seems to validate this somewhat, with Sendo’s estimated web traffic dropping significantly against Tiki’s. 
 She also rightly pointed out that mergers of this nature are bound to be complicated due to the complexities and competing interests involved. 
 So what’s next for Sendo and Tiki? First, the deal is not necessarily dead – these media-driven histrionics could be a tactic to renegotiate the terms. 
 Second, it’s apparent that JD has enough resources to invest more into Southeast Asia if it wants to. Right now, it doesn’t appear to be making moves in Vietnam or Indonesia that changes the pecking order, but that could change down the line. 
 Whatever happens next, we’ll be here to help make sense of things. We also can’t wait to show you what else we have in our pipeline of stories about Vietnam. 
 Moving on, a number of other things caught our attention. Our China reporter, Nicole Jao, broke down  a Chinese smartphone brand’s rapid rise in Southeast Asia and India . Launching another smartphone brand these days might seem counterintuitive due to the thin margins and commoditized nature of the product, but Realme has some advantages going for it. 
 Lastly, Singapore reporter Joseph Gan  tackled a taboo: the rise of cannabis tech in Asia . As someone who’s never tried the product, I must say editing this piece has been educational for me. 
 It’s interesting that the Singapore government, known for its tough stance on drugs, is researching on how to produce the chemicals in cannabis without growing the plant. A VC in Singapore is also starting a dedicated cannabis fund. 
 As always, please  subscribe  if you like our work and want to support it. 
 I’ll see you next week!

652691,The new phase of user engagement," Customer engagement is  extremely important .  Engaged users  not only interact with a business but also use and promote its products – things that help it stay ahead of its competitors. 
 However, traditional methods of customer engagement are decreasing in effectiveness. For example, the average open rate of email newsletters stands at  21.33%  and the average click rate is at a mere 2.62%. 
 Though marketers are taking advertising online to reach younger audiences, studies have found that  59% of millennials  skip ads on platforms like YouTube, and  more than half of Generation Z users  have ad blockers on their browsers. 
 The  rise of mobile technology  has also presented new challenges to businesses looking to connect with users. 
 While the availability of multiple channels such as email, SMS, social media, and push notifications has made it easier for companies to reach customers, people consequently experience information overload, which makes  keeping and retaining customer attention  an uphill task. 
 Both user attention and engagement are now coveted prizes in the eyes of marketers and product developers. But while engaging users is becoming more difficult, many companies are rising to the challenge, using new and different techniques and technologies to do so. 
 Eyes on the prize 
 One example is internet company Sea. Two of Sea’s subsidiaries, ecommerce service Shopee and gaming platform Garena, utilize a variety of strategies to boost user engagement and drive sales across different platforms. 
 Shopee has rolled out a variety of initiatives to  create a holistic shopping experience  for its customers. One is through gamification: Users can earn Shopee coins – the platform’s currency that can be exchanged for discounts – by playing simple in-app games like Shopee Shake. 
 Some games have a community element as well. In Shopee Farm, players water a plant and receive a reward when it is fully grown. Friends are able to water each other’s plants, which encourages players to rope others into the game and onto Shopee’s platform.

 Users can also see what friends have been buying through the Shopee Feed, turning online shopping into a communal experience. Much like typical social media platforms, customers can follow friends and sellers, and receive real-time updates on purchases, deals, and other events happening on Shopee. 
 For Garena, the company launched mobile game  Free Fire  in 2017 in order to  tap into the mobile gaming market . With an install size of just 1GB,  Free Fire  is much more accessible to users in developing markets, for whom data consumption and storage space are significant concerns, enabling Garena to engage with a whole new pool of customers. 
 The gaming company has also  put fans at the center  of what it does. From cosplay tournaments to celebrity-led charity matches, Garena has created an ecosystem where fans can engage with fellow gamers and enjoy their favorite games across a variety of mediums.

 Such approaches have paid off: Sea’s total adjusted revenue in the last quarter of 2019  was US$909.1 million , an increase of 133.5% from US$389.3 million for the same period in 2018. 
 Rewriting the rules of user engagement 
 Both Shopee and Garena are constantly evolving, taking into consideration user needs in order to better engage with them. 
 Shopee is working to deliver more personalized shopping experiences through an AI-driven recommendation engine, and Garena’s recently-launched Booyah livestreaming app caters to the rising demand for mobile gaming content. 
 Companies need to explore different ways of connecting to customers. By creating unique experiences that are intriguing, fun, and helpful to users, brands are able to engage them better, keeping them on their platforms as they consume and advocate for their products and services. 
 
 Featuring Omer Iqbal, engineering lead for Booyah at Garena, and Zhong Nan, product lead of search and recommendations at Shopee, “Rewriting the Rules of User Engagement with Shopee and Garena” is an online event that will explore specific examples of how the two companies have utilized emerging technology to create new forms of user engagement.

652485,Jio Platforms wraps up fundraising spree at over $20b,"    
  
 ||item|| 
 Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) said it has reached its target capital for Jio Platforms, its digital services arm, after bagging  US$4.5 billion  from Google last week. Jio has now raised a total of over US$20 billion in less than four months. 
 Google is the latest investor to come on board after Facebook, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, L Catterton, TPG Capital, Public Investment Fund, Qualcomm, and Intel pitched in. 
 The deal marks the start of the search engine giant’s broader plan for India, where it looks to spend a total of  US$10 billion . According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, the company’s investment in Jio is the first and biggest deal made through its Google for India Digitization Fund, which aims to bolster the country’s digital economy over the next five to seven years. 
 A slice of India’s digital future 
    
     
 There are several good reasons why many big-name investors wanted to back Jio’s ambitions. For one, India’s digital future is expected to generate  US$710 billion  in revenue by 2024. 
 Moreover, it operates a wide array of highly relevant digital services, such as online payments, online grocery, and music streaming, and has a lofty goal of helping India’s 1.3 billion people and small businesses go digital. 
 Jio Platforms also operates India’s largest telco, Reliance Jio, which has nearly 400 million subscribers. 
 According to Greyhound Research, each of Jio’s investors brings  unique values  to the table to help it reach its goal. 
 For example, Facebook can provide the Indian company with access to its vast user base and data analytics prowess. KKR, on the other hand, can offer its experience in managing and running telco businesses as well as scaling consumer apps. These capabilities can effectively back Jio’s reported ambition to create a WeChat-like super app via a partnership between Facebook’s WhatsApp and its own ecommerce unit, JioMart. 
 The strategic investments from Intel and Qualcomm, meanwhile, can also come in handy for Jio’s 5G plans, which include  developing its own 5G solutions  from scratch. 
 “Jio is ready with a world-class 5G solution. Field deployment can happen next year,” RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani revealed during the company’s general meeting last week. “Once Jio’s 5G solution is proven at India’s scale, Jio Platforms would be well-positioned to be an exporter to other telecom operators globally as a complete managed service.” 
 When it comes to the mass adoption of these future digital services from Jio, Google has it covered. Its collaboration with the digital services arm will focus on developing cheap smartphones and a customized version of the Android mobile operating system – an effort to equip everyone in India with a smart device. 
 According to  Statista , the number of smartphone users in India could reach 442 million by 2022. Jio’s partnership with Google would not only boost this number but also help Reliance Jio plug a significant portion of that segment into its network. 
 That said, Jio can potentially have a presence in all layers of India’s digital ecosystem – from smartphone adoption and internet connectivity to digital lifestyle services – setting it up for digital dominance in the country. 
 “The addition of new digital products targeting various sectors will pose threats to many large dominant players. Having strategic partners like Facebook and Google validates that Reliance’s game plan is real,” Ambani, who is also India’s richest man, said. 
 But with Amazon looking to cash in on India’s digital future as well, Jio isn’t without competition. 
 Amazon had previously touted India as one of its most important growth markets, committing US$6.5 billion in the country. The ecommerce titan already has plans to deploy over US$1 billion of this to  help  digitize local small and medium-sized businesses. It’s also  reportedly  eyeing a US$2 billion stake in Jio’s telco rival Airtel.

652655,Disrupting a dinosaur industry,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Hello readers, 
 It’s tough to be an ecommerce marketplace, even more so when you need to deal with the traditional and skeptical manufacturers of Indonesia’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector. 
 So what are these challenges? Scroll down for a summary or click  here for the full article . (🔒) 
  But first, here are your quick bytes for the day:  
 1️⃣ A chip-testing equipment provider based in Singapore saw a  53% surge in its share price . Its main customer, Intel, accounts for over 90% of its revenue. 
 2️⃣ After India imposed a ban on 59 Chinese mobile apps,  including UC Web, the Alibaba subsidiary  slashed jobs  in the country. 
 3️⃣ JD.com  has signed a partnership  to become a sponsor and marketing go-to for Tencent’s esports league, King Pro League. 
 4️⃣ Siam Commercial Bank, is going up against Grab and Gojek: Thailand’s oldest bank is set to launch  own food delivery  service this month. 
 5️⃣ TikTok was planning to set up its global headquarters to the UK, but talks  have been halted . The move would have created 3,000 jobs. 
 6️⃣ SoftBank has  quietly sold  $2.2 billion of its stake in Alibaba Group to pay down debt and buy back its own shares. 
 Disrupting ain’t easy for Indonesia’s ecommerce players 
   
Many of us are binge-shopping online these days and loving the convenience of it. But Indonesia’s fast-moving consumer goods sector might not be as open to ecommerce as we are. 
 That’s making things slightly  difficult for Mitra Bukalapak  (🔒). 
 
 
 So… what’s Mitra Bukalapak?  It’s an app by Bukalapak that allows  warung  owners to order FMCG products like Pringles chips, cans of Sprite, Panadol tablets, and Dettol detergent for their stores as well as sell digital goods like phone credits and train tickets.  
 
 “It’s complicated”  That’s the relationship status of ecommerce marketplaces and FMCG companies. Online marketplaces like Mitra need to strike a balance between their own activities as well as the interests of these bigtime manufacturers,  but that’s easier said than done. 
 
 Dinosaur industry:  FMCG companies have been around for such a long time and operating with so many established rules that nobody questions them anymore. 
 
 One of them being pricing:  Discounts, cashbacks, and free deliveries are everywhere in tech or ecommerce startups, but these practices are frowned upon by FMCG companies. 
 
 But  Bukalapak believes that there are opportunities for FMCG and ecommerce industries to work together. 
 
 Our deep dive for today:  Can Mitra Bukalapak succeed despite Indonesia’s FMCG giants?  (🔒)

 Using Grab and Gojek to intimidate activists 
   
The new way of intimidation in Indonesia? Using Grab and Gojek to  send food to unsuspecting recepients . 
 
 
 Heaps of food  were dispatched by unknown senders to human rights activists in June even though they didn’t place them. Those orders were reportedly  made through their  Grab and Gojek accounts.  
 
 Most lost:  Not only did the activists have to deal with angry delivery drivers, but they also had to pay for the food, with one couple losing around 680,000 rupiah (US$48) – a significant sum for them. 
 
 A call  to Grab and Gojek’s customer service centers didn’t help. “They wouldn’t believe that my account is hijacked, claiming that the system is well-protected,” one of the activists shared. 
 
 Left traumatized:  Some of the activists no longer use any ride-hailing or food delivery apps on their phones. And even if some of them still do, one said that they’re still spooked whenever they app drivers hanging around her neighborhood.

651487,How to write the perfect introductory email that will secure you a meeting with investors," Finding the right investor for your startup requires a solid business plan, plenty of hustle, and that basic step of sending emails. 
 All founders, at one point or another, find themselves initiating contact with people they barely know – and that includes sending a warm or cold email to a well-known venture capitalist. 
 
  Photo credit: Damian Zaleski 
 
 Unfortunately, it’s easy to make mistakes in an email, which can lead to a poor first impression. 
 Here’s a simple and straightforward template for reaching out to investors that would catch their attention. 
  “Hi XYZ,  
  I hope my email finds you well.  
  I am contacting you as I know XYZ from your portfolio company XYZ.”  
 These first lines are polite and to the point. You could also explain why you are contacting them by talking about their latest investment that has some similarities with your company. 
 More importantly, these lines are professional. People often use gimmicky introductions to grab an investor’s attention, but while a VC may be inclined to read them, that doesn’t guarantee that they will respond to them. 
  “You might be interested in MY COMPANY. We are raising US$1.5 million to propel the company’s expansion and strengthen its technology development capabilities.”  
 This is the thesis statement, the “why” of your email. Make sure to put it within the first two or three sentences of your email, and have it go straight to the point, as VCs read hundreds of emails per day. 
  “I have included a high-level summary below and attached a brief teaser on MY COMPANY’s progress.”  
 This sentence shows your preparation. It says you have done the work and can answer any follow-up questions they may have. 
  “Top-line growth: MY COMPANY closed 2015 at US$XX million in revenue, targeting 1,000% growth to US$XX million in 2016. Year to date, we’ve secured revenue of US$XX million with a qualified pipeline.”  
 Since you have already explained why you are emailing and have shown that you are a professional entrepreneur, it’s now time to make the argument for why a VC should invest in your business. 
 Share some high-level statistics that you do not mind being made public, such as growth statistics, revenue numbers, or customer acquisition statistics. Most VCs will ask you for these details anyway, and should they become public, their revelation won’t make much of an impact on the success of your startup. 
 These numbers also give VCs a quick overview and understanding of your business and will help them dig deeper should they wish to have a meeting with you. 
 However, it should go without saying that you must not make up statistics, as it’s a sure way to tank any potential deal. 
  “MY COMPANY operates in the enterprise data and analytics space – analytics, predictive analytics, machine learning, and vertically focused data services. The market was forecasted by Gartner to exceed US$33 billion in 2016, up from US$27 billion in 2015.  
  Customers: Leading F500 across five sectors (food &amp; beverage, finance, energy, pharmaceuticals, and information and communications technology), including clients such as A, B, C, D.”  
 It’s important to explain the market you are trying to attract. A great business idea means nothing if its potential market is negligible in size, so show that there are a lot of people willing to buy your product or pay for your services. 
  “Team: Strong executive bench (Microsoft, Oracle, Facebook, etc.). Top chief marketing officer on board since July 2016 (McKinsey). Fourteen full-time staff, a 16-member part-time virtual data team.  
  Technology: A proprietary, mobile-, and web-based XX.”  
 This part of the email focuses on the company itself: Who works there? How is the team? What kind of technology do you have supporting the product? 
 Whereas the first half of your message looks outward, this part looks inward. Not only are you pitching yourself as a founder and CEO, you are also pitching the people who work for you. 
 VCs want to back a team they believe can execute a business plan, so this is where you make that argument. 
  “Let me know if you are interested to know more about MY COMPANY and I’ll be happy to meet you at your office.”  
 This is a friendly yet still professional conclusion. Wrapping up the message needs nothing longer than one or two sentences. 
 Now that you have a template for writing a professional email, that is one less hurdle toward meeting the perfect VC to fund your startup.

652565,Mitra Bukalapak’s roadblock: Indonesia’s FMCG giants," Bukalapak is at a crossroads. It sits in fourth place among Indonesia’s mobile ecommerce apps, behind Shopee, Tokopedia, and Lazada, according to estimates seen by  Tech in Asia  and price comparison site  iPrice . 
 Ecommerce growth in the country is hampered by underdeveloped infrastructure in second- and third-tier cities,  various   reports  note.

 Launched in late 2017,  Mitra Bukalapak  could herald a new growth spurt for the company. The initiative marked Bukalapak move into offline retail, and its goal is to supply goods to Indonesia’s roadside stores or  warungs , which in turn sell those items to consumers. Since then, many competitors have sprung up, each attempting a different approach to tackle a common problem: Indonesia’s fragmented retail supply chain. 
 But these players’ experiences highlight an obstacle for anyone looking to disrupt the status quo: well-entrenched incumbents. For Mitra Bukalapak, it finds itself grappling with skeptical manufacturers, which have strong economies of scale and strict policies on how their goods are priced and distributed. The company, for instance, had to deal with pushback from major cigarette distributor Sampoerna, sources tell  Tech in Asia . 
 Bukalapak also has to convince  warung  owners to stock up through an app when they’re used to pen-and-paper methods. 
 These factors raise questions about whether Mitra Bukalapak, which claims to have onboarded 5 million partner  warungs , can be financially sustainable, since most of the profits are captured by incumbents occupying the top of the supply chain. 
 Howard Gani, senior vice president of online-to-offline at Bukalapak, says the company has since established “far more improved and structured partnerships” with all major principals. A Sampoerna representative didn’t respond to  Tech in Asia ’s request for comment. 
 Protecting their turf 
 When Mitra Bukalapak was starting up, the company had limited relationships with fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. That’s a crucial gap, considering the program aims to supply  warungs  with FMCG products. 
 The ecommerce unicorn then relied on unofficial distributors while establishing partnerships with the manufacturers at the same time. But this approach caused Sampoerna, one of Indonesia’s largest tobacco companies, to bristle at how Bukalapak violated its pricing policies, three sources tell  Tech in Asia . 
 They add that this chain of events happened sometime in 2019, and Bukalapak had trouble offloading its fast-expiring cigarette stock to  warungs  as a result. 
 While Mitra Bukalapak has pressed on despite the incident, it underscores how ecommerce marketplaces need to strike a balance between their own activities and the interests of FMCG incumbents – not the easiest task. 
 There’s a limit to how far an innovative company can disrupt a traditional business. 
 When viewing the entire retail supply chain, the most powerful players are not the ecommerce marketplaces. From global giants like Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever to local heavyweights like Mayora Indah or Sampoerna, manufacturers claim the bulk of margins and power – after all, they make the products. These companies are deeply entrenched, with well-established ways of doing business, including having specific processes as well as official distributors. 
 Sampoerna, for example, exerts influence on the retail industry through its Sampoerna Retail Community, a  warung  partnership program that the company has links to over 100,000 stores. 
 Ecommerce marketplaces are reportedly careful to avoid disrupting or cannibalizing FMCGs and their official distributors. There’s a limit to how far an innovative company can go in disrupting a traditional business.

 “If it ends up with backlash, then it’s not good. You might lose [your] business, reputation, and network,” says the founder of a startup that has dealt with FMCG firms. “It’s a dinosaur industry. It’s been around for a long time, and there are many established rules that nobody questions. It’s just how it is.” 
 For many of these FMCG companies, pricing appears to be a particularly sensitive issue. Discounts, cashbacks, and free deliveries are typical tech or ecommerce practices, but that’s not the case for FMCG companies, which may view these strategies in a negative light. 
 “I think it’s an honest mistake that startups may often commit,” says the founder. “Many startup employees don’t necessarily come from an FMCG background.” 
 An analyst who requested anonymity says that based on a conversation with an FMCG company, 40% to 50% of what Mitra Bukalapak offers doesn’t really overlap with that company’s distribution coverage. Given that, the company would have no problems with programs like Mitra Bukalapak. 
 Brands like Sampoerna can enforce strict pricing and distribution policies. 
 But cigarettes may be a different story. A report from investment firm CLSA states that cigarettes make up the largest single item sold by  warungs  and, along with coffee and instant noodles, account for around 80% of daily sales. Cigarettes also have thin margins and expire more quickly compared to personal or home care products like soap or detergent. 
 As such, Mitra Bukalapak may be pressured to offer discounts because it needs to move the goods before they expire. On the other hand, brands like Sampoerna can enforce strict pricing and distribution policies. 
 The startup founder says there’s also the matter of unauthorized traders, who often attempt to make money by playing with the margins via methods like buying cheaper stock from Mitra Bukalapak but then reselling them at retail prices. That’s why these rules around pricing are particularly important to the brands, the founder adds. 
 Cigarette companies in Indonesia are also unique because the industry is heavily regulated by the government due to health hazards associated with smoking. This strong regulatory oversight would make manufacturers more conservative. For instance, marketing a new cigarette brand or product is more difficult compared to other consumer goods. Ads for cigarettes – be they billboards, print, or television – have long been forbidden from featuring the actual products. 
 A way forward 
 That said, Bukalapak’s Gani believes that there are “multiple opportunities” for FMCG and ecommerce industries to work together. 
 “With Mitra Bukalapak specifically, we’re able to offer a clear and direct communication path and a transparent and efficient channel to reach [partner  warungs ],” he explains. While supermarkets or convenience stores in the modern trade channel have grown, Gani thinks that “the general trade channel still commands a major proportion of FMCG product sales.” 
 High distribution costs are another hurdle for FMCG companies in Indonesia, says a Sampoerna employee who asked not to be named. Such companies have also invested in giving out promotions and discounts to reach sales targets, and technically, working with a marketplace like Bukalapak can cut down distribution costs. 
 Gani agrees with this point, highlighting the inefficiencies in the general trade supply chain that hinders or limits FMCG firms from effectively reaching end retailers. 
 “Mitra Bukalapak is trying to streamline these complex processes by providing an end-to-end digital sales channel that allows FMCG players to directly tailor their interaction with the end retailers,” he adds. 
   
 Bukalapak currently sources products from both third-party distributors as well as manufacturers. It operates both its own warehouses and shared ones (in the case of distributors) as well as its own logistics fleet. 
 It makes margins from the sale of these products to the  warungs , though there’s also the question of subsidies and cashbacks. The CLSA report says that these incentives are instrumental in convincing  warungs  to sign up for Mitra Bukalapak and similar programs, with 93% of the 48 respondents saying that they initially joined because of these perks. 
 “I think it’s nothing to lose for  warung  owners. They just need to install the Bukalapak app in the smartphone [to get the subsidies],” says an analyst who has looked into this space. Without it, the  warung  owners can easily go back to their traditional way of sourcing products from wet markets or supermarkets. 
 Gani, however, says that Mitra Bukalapak is not focusing on heavy subsidies. 
 “Our goal is to build better engagement, provide better services, and continuously enlarge our physical and digital products offerings,” he points out. 
 Going up the supply chain 
 What is Mitra Bukalapak’s path to profitability? Instead of simply increasing transaction volumes, it could boost margins by going up the supply chain and merging with or becoming a distributor itself. 
 While manufacturers capture most of the profits, distribution businesses can also make money, albeit with slim margins. This means players like Mitra Bukalapak would be left with an even thinner slice. 
 A look at PT Tigaraksa Satria could provide a better understanding of this. The company is an FMCG distributor that brings various consumer goods brands – including Nutricia, Quaker Oats, Ovaltine, and Colgate – to retail locations across the country. 
 Its 2019 revenues totaled 13.4 trillion rupiah (US$925.7 million), with gross profits at 1.68 trillion rupiah (US$115.1 million or about 12.5% of revenue) and net profits at 428 billion rupiah (US$29.6 million or nearly 3.2% of revenue). Almost all its cost of goods is attributed to inventory purchases. 
 Since February 2018, Mitra Bukalapak has been sourcing items from PT Tigaraksa Satria as well. In 2019, the FMCG distributor said in its annual report that it supplied a total of 150,000 Mitra Bukalapak  warungs . 
 “PT Tigaraksa Satria is one of Mitra Bukalapak’s partners,” Gani says. “We are also working with other national distributors and various local  MSME -sized distributors to fulfill the increasing demand from our [ warungs ] across the nation.” 
 In 2019, PT Tigaraksa Satria earned 2.4 trillion rupiah (US$166 million) from its Bukalapak connection – roughly 18% of total revenue. That resulted in gross profits of 214.9 billion rupiah (US$14.9 million or about 9% of revenue) and net profits of 46 billion rupiah (US$3.2 million or 0.13% of revenue). 
    
     
 Based on their relationship with merchants/ warungs , programs like Mitra Bukalapak seem to occupy a space somewhere between third-party distributors and players such as Warung Pintar, a startup backed by East Ventures. 
 Mitra Bukalapak has a relationship with  warungs , but technically, these  warungs  can still source their goods from other places. Warung Pintar, meanwhile, has an end-to-end relationship with each of its  warungs , from the prefabricated kiosk all the way to distribution of goods. The startup makes margins directly from its own distribution business, says co-founder and CEO Agung Bezharie Hadinegoro. 
 “Of course, Warung Pintar doesn’t have capital like Tokopedia or Bukalapak, which is why we don’t try to compete with their aggressive expansion,” he explains. “But we aim to build a model with more responsible unit economics from the start.” 
 The flipside is that Warung Pintar grows at a slower pace compared to Mitra Bukalapak. By mid-2019, Warung Pintar had  2,000  warungs   and was targeting to hit 5,000 by the end of that year. Meanwhile, Mitra Bukalapak has close to 5 million  warungs  and agents. 
 That said, becoming a full-fledged distributor might require Bukalapak to expand beyond its core tech competency. Gani says the company currently has no plans to embark on such a path. 
 “We are still focusing on creating accessible technology adoption for MSMEs from all segments and scale up the kiosk competitiveness,” he explains.

 However, concerns remain for FMCG players, says the Sampoerna employee. An FMCG company’s head office has a lot of power in determining sales channels and other strategies, and at this point, they don’t necessarily see the value in going through marketplaces yet because the returns on investment aren’t proven. 
 “Once an FMCG opens the ‘floodgates’ to ecommerce marketplaces, there’s no way back, which is why they’re conservative about this,” the person says. “There might be future unexpected costs and other things to consider.” 
 According to the analyst that  Tech in Asia  spoke to, some FMCG players may be more open to working with ecommerce platforms than others, but they also need to be mindful of their long relationships with their authorized distributors. 
 Still, the analyst thinks that programs like Mitra Bukalapak have been an eye opener for manufacturers. It shows how ecommerce could be a viable distribution channel and eventually cooperate with manufacturers as a full-fledged distributor. 
 “Distribution and logistics costs are some of the less efficient ones [for FMCG], and they actually can make it more efficient if they try to consolidate the distribution [by partnering with ecommerce firms],” the analyst notes. “Right now, they have to go through so many parties to distribute to  warungs .” 
 Less than 10% of retail 
 Ultimately, ecommerce still represents just a tiny chunk of Indonesian retail, accounting for  3%  of the country’s total retail sales in 2017, estimates Statista. In 2018, that number went up to  8%  and is expected it to reach 18% by 2023, according to a Morgan Stanley study. 
 By bringing  warungs  online, ecommerce platforms are also increasing their share of the pie. If Indonesia were to realize its full ecommerce potential, this would – or should – happen sooner or later. 
 “Stabilizing the economy at the micro level [which Mitra Bukalapak does] also means contributing to the country’s economic resilience,” says Gani. 
 The startup founder considers Mitra Bukalapak and similar programs to be attempts at tidying up the “messy” supply chain. 
 “A lot of things are still semi-manual. A lot of infrastructure building needs to be done, so we think it’s all healthy competition,” the founder observes.

 The Sampoerna employee says that for now, there is no official agreement between Bukalapak and the tobacco company. 
 In the meantime, Gani says Mitra Bukalapak has been growing steadily in the past year and in the first quarter of 2020. Though he didn’t not specify figures, he notes that the program’s number of transactions, retention rate, and gross merchandise volume continue to increase. 
 The company is also  teaming up  with Bank Mandiri – Indonesia’s largest bank by assets – to turn  warungs  into banking agents. 
 Gani says that despite the Covid-19 pandemic and Jakarta’s erstwhile large-scale social restrictions, Mitra Bukalapak is not seeing a significant impact. 
 “Most of our mitras sells daily staples, so our mitras are still operational and an essential part of the economy,” he says.

652427,"Yo, pothead investors and founders"," Dear readers, 
 This week, my colleague Joseph Gan wrote a piece called “ Cannabis tech on the rise in Asia .” It’s a fascinating read, and it triggered good memories of my time at Y Combinator (YC) in 2015. 
 Being a born and bred average Singaporean, I live in a society where marijuana is a big no-no. I first got to know more about cannabis (or pot, weed – all the same) when I met YC batchmates who founded  Meadow . During one of the founder dinners, they explained what their company does, but I didn’t quite understand back then. It did, however, give me a lot to think about. Is that shit legal? And why are people back home so against it?

 Fast forward five years, and marijuana is slowly being legalized in the West but is still largely prohibited in Asia. Oddly enough, though, the continent is home to the highest number of cannabis users in the world, with an estimated 86 million in 2019, according to Future Food Asia. 🤔 
 I’ve gained more understanding about it over the years, and now I believe that marijuana is just like alcohol or cigarettes – they all give you a good buzz. (Fair warning, however: You should never take the consumption of these substances to the extreme.) Unfortunately, marijuana has a bad reputation because it is  categorized as drugs . And people generally regard drugs as evil or harmful because they’re highly addictive. Other factors such as  culture, familiarity, and acceptance  are also at work: 
  
  “Unlike weed, people have consumed alcohol en masse in the western world for a long time. Alcohol has been very much part of western history. From the bible to other famous literary books they all involve alcohol in it.”
  
  Money  is also an issue, at least in the US: 
 
 
  “Alcohol is legal because states have figured out how to make money off of it. Cigarettes are legal because they are taxable and profitable. 
   Weed is just now becoming legal because (wait for it) states are figuring out they can make money off of it. It’s not really any more dangerous than alcohol and cigarettes, but the way to tax it has been an issue.”
 
 
 If it’s legal and there’s money to be made, would you start a company to ride this wave? And would investors back those companies? 
 Let’s take a quick look at the opportunity and comparables: 
    
     
 In short, assuming we are all amoral and believe that the marijuana industry can be at least as big as cigarettes, then this opportunity is too big to be ignored. It could give birth to a number of billion-dollar companies, particularly in Asia. 
 But the timing of entry is always tricky, and just like any other business, it isn’t as easy as it seems. Eaze, one of the most well-funded cannabis startups, reported getting one cannabis order on its platform  every seven seconds  in 2019, but it still  struggled  to find a sustainable business model. 
 Even if you are totally against marijuana, I’d urge you to keep an open mind. As detailed in our  deep-dive piece , the cannabis trend could potentially open up other opportunities in areas including packaging, farm tech, sensors, and even blockchain tracking.

 Hello readers, 
 Ending the week with a deep dive into  potentially one of the biggest mergers in Vietnam’s tech space –  if  it pushes through. 
 Tiki and Sendo are arguably the two most notable Vietnamese ecommerce startups and they are thinking of joining forces to  battle regional powerhouses Shopee and Lazada . 
  But first, your quick bytes for the day:  
 1️⃣ Wish you could order food using digital currency? That might come sooner than you think as China’s central bank has plans to  test its digital currency  on Meituan-Dianping. 
 2️⃣ China’s biggest chipmaker has a great stock debut. It almost  tripled its value . 
 3️⃣ Uber has a  new president  for its India and South Asia division: Prabhjeet Singh. 
 4️⃣ VPN providers are  thinking of removing  its Hong Kong servers due to the new national law. 
 5️⃣ Don’t be shocked when you see a  kangaroo-like robot  organizing the sandwiches, drinks, and ready-to-eat meals on display at a Japanese convenience store. 
 6️⃣ Reliance Jio has  risen through the ranks  to become one of the big boys, now sitting with China’s Alibaba and Tencent, according to some industry watchers. 
 Joining forces to go up against Shopee and Lazada? 
    
 Tiki and Sendo are two of the biggest startups in Vietnam. So betcha news of these two possibly joining forces has regional ecommerce titans on edge. 👀 
 Quick points to note as the two potentially  unite to bring the titans down  (🔒): 
 
 
 Different but the same.  Tiki and Sendo have different business models and are chasing after different customer segments in Vietnam, so on paper, the merger makes sense.    
 
 A potential David versus Goliath story?  Regional heavyweights Shopee and Lazada are backed by Sea Group (US$50 billion market cap) and Alibaba (US$660 billion market cap), respectively. If the merger happens, it should give both Tiki and Sendo a better chance of surviving the competition.  
 
 Let’s hear it from the merchants:   Tech in Asia  spoke to some Vietnamese merchants whose sentiment seems to be, “Shopee FTW” – though there’s a “but” there that must be taken into account to get the full context.

 SoftBank’s rollercoaster ride of highs and lows 
    
 Remember this statement from Masayoshi Son in 2016? “Over the next decade, the SoftBank Vision Fund will be the biggest investor in the technology sector.” 
 Now, four years later, are you Team Softbank or nah? 
 Can’t decide? We’re going to help you out by diving into Softbank’s journey,  through its extreme highs and lows . 
 
 
 The beginning  From 2017 to 2018, the Vision Fund invested about US$46.6 billion in roughly 70 companies, including some that were unlisted and eventually went bankrupt. 
 
 The low:  Uber went public in 2019 but its share price tanked within three days. People started questioning Softbank’s investments. 
 
 The further low:  The whole WeWork fiasco of maybe-IPO to “bye-bye, IPO,” which led to the startup cutting cost by slashing its workforce and slowing down expansions.  
 
 The high:  Softbank sees light in 2020 as some of its high-profile investments, including Uber and Slack, started to see their share prices soar.

652495,US$11 billion across over 400 deals in Asia in June,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Hello readers, 
 Despite the global pandemic, Chinese and Indian companies are still attracting the big bucks from investors. They’re the top two markets benefiting from fundraising, receiving 60% and 17%, respectively, of the US$11 billion that was pumped into Asia in June, as our  latest visual story illustrates  (🔒). 
 Scroll down for more details and to see who got the largest slice of this expensive pie. 
  But first, your quick bytes for today:  
 1️⃣ Skype co-founder Toivo Annus  has passed away at the age of 48 due to an “unexpected illness.”  Annus was known for his work at Skype, where he had led the engineering team until ecommerce major eBay acquired the company in late 2005. He then moved on to focus on his investment firm Ambient Sound Investments where he invested in numerous Asian startups, including Coda Payments and Sea Group. 
 2️⃣ Google  injects $4.5 billion  into Jio Platforms for a 7.7% stake in Jio. 
 3️⃣ With TikTok now banned in India, local alternative Roposo is rising to fill the gap left behind: Its user acquisition rate is peaking at 500,000 new users an hour and it expects to hit 100 million total users by  the end of July . 
 4️⃣ No shortage of Playstation 5 units or Oculus VR headsets to worry about as Sony and Facebook  ramp up production  of their respective gaming devices to meet pandemic-driven demand. 
 5️⃣ Recovery looks to be on the cards for Airbnb, which  recorded more than  one million bookings globally on July 8 – the first time it has happened since March 3. 
 6️⃣ A new filing by Alibaba reveals that Ant Group’s consumer finance app Alipay claims to have  1.3 billion annual active users  as of March. Ant has been actively publicizing itself as a technology company that offers payment gateways and sells digital infrastructure to financial institutions – rather than be a direct competitor to them. 
 Asian fundraising not slowing down 
  Who were the most active investors in Asia for the month of June 2020 and what countries and verticals were they betting on? In the article, you can click on each category to zoom in. 
 
 
 So we’re in the middle of a global pandemic that’s bringing about recessions and belt-tightening measures across the board. 
 But the news doesn’t seem to have reached some investors, because they’re continuing to  pour loads of money into Asia  (🔒). 
 
 
 That’s very cash money of you.  In June, over US$11 billion in funding – across over 400 deals – was poured into Asia, topping last month’s count of more than 300. 
 
 Biggest piece of the pie.  Getting the lion’s share of the total amount is Jio Platforms, which scored a total of US$3.7 billion in funding from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, L Catterton, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and TPG Capital. This takes its total funding within two months to US$15.2 billion, including fresh capital from Facebook, KKR, and General Atlantic. 
 
 The leading countries.  Overall, 60% of the total funding in June went to China, followed by India (17%), Japan (8%), and Singapore (7%).

 Mo’ money, fewer problems 
   
Los Angeles- and Singapore-based VC firm Wavemaker Partners has  closed its third Southeast Asia fund  at US$111 million, exceeding its target of US$100 million. 
 
 
 A new addition.  Concentric Equity Partners joins the firm’s existing institutional backers, which include Pavilion Capital, Temasek, the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Vulcan Capital. The new fund has a total of 73 limited partners, according to a statement. 
 
 Plans and intentions.  The company previously said that its SEA Fund 3, which will be managed by its managing partners Paul Santos and Eric Manlunas, aims to invest in 60 new companies with an initial check size of about US$500,000. 
 
 Enterprise tech is the special of the day.  Companies that recently raised funding from Wavemaker include construction site management software startup Novade, Indonesian business-to-business e-marketplace GudangAda, and laser-based communications startup Transcelestial.

652524,How SoftBank rode its multibillion-dollar bets through extreme highs and lows," Masayoshi Son shocked the world in 2016 when he announced that SoftBank Group would be raising US$100 billion to back global tech companies. “Over the next decade, the SoftBank Vision Fund will be the biggest investor in the technology sector,” he said. 
 The fund set off to do what it intended to accomplish – invest in promising companies with multibillion-dollar bets. In less than two years, it had deployed 70% of its total capital. 
 Some of these bets paid off, while others left much to be desired. Here’s a timeline of what happened. 
 Eagle eye 
  January 2017:  SoftBank was mulling  a US$1 billion investment into WeWork  from what would be its US$100 billion Vision Fund. The Japanese conglomerate was also said to be considering backing ride-hailing major Uber. 
  May 2017:  The company announced the first close of its mega tech fund with  US$93 billion  in confirmed commitments, making it the largest tech-focused investment fund ever raised. The company had already negotiated roughly a dozen deals for the Vision Fund at the time, including a US$1.4 billion injection into Paytm. 
 SoftBank itself committed US$28 billion to the fund, with companies such as Apple, Foxconn, Qualcomm, Sharp, and the United Arab Emirate’s Mubadala pitching in as well. One of the fund’s most notable backers was Saudi Arabian sovereign fund PIF, which contributed a hefty US$45 billion. 
 At the end of the month, SoftBank shares soared to 4,497.5 yen (US$42.07), after closing at 3,931 yen (US$36.77) in late March. 
    
     
  August 2017:  WeWork  formally announced  SoftBank’s US$4.4 billion investment in the company. About US$3 billion went to WeWork’s parent firm and US$1.4 billion to WeWork China, WeWork Japan, and WeWork Pacific. 
 The co-working startup did not disclose its valuation after the deal, but a source familiar with the matter told  Forbes  that the startup was valued in the “high teens” of billions. 
  January 2018:  Uber said that SoftBank’s US$1.2 billion investment deal had  officially closed . The agreement came together a month prior, when a SoftBank-led consortium made a tender offer that valued Uber at US$48 billion, a steep discount from its most recent valuation of US$68 billion at the time. 
 SoftBank then continued to  make big bets  for the rest of the year. 
 Its Vision Fund led roughly 35 investment rounds, including those of Chinese healthtech firm Ping An, Indian online grocer Grofers, and TikTok owner ByteDance. 
 The company also topped up investments into some of its existing portfolio companies such as Tokopedia, Oyo, and Grab. 
  December 2018:  The Vision Fund’s total investment through December 2018 rose to about  US$46.6 billion . The number of investees had also doubled to roughly 70, including some that were unlisted. 
 The company carried this momentum through early 2019, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into new and existing portfolio companies. 
 Blurring sights 
  February 2019:  The  Wall Street Journal  reported that PIF and Mubadala had become  concerned  about SoftBank’s practice of investing in companies first then later transferring the stakes to the Vision Fund, often at higher prices. 
  March 2019:  Son said that the Vision Fund had already invested 70% of its US$100 billion cache. He also noted that many of its portfolio companies, including Uber, were planning on going public. 
 Son claimed that the fund’s return on investment was “ very good ” but that the massive spending had raised concerns that the company may need to launch another mega fund. 
  May 2019:  Uber went public on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial share price of US$45 and a market cap of US$75.5 billion. But in the three days following the IPO, SoftBank had lost about  US$16 billion  in market value off of Uber’s tanking share price. 
 This raised concerns about SoftBank’s investments into WeWork, another money-burning portfolio firm that was looking to go public at the time. 
 While SoftBank’s stock price ended April at 5,777.5 yen (US$54.04), it closed out May at 5,125 yen (US$47.94). 
  July 2019:  SoftBank announced plans to establish Vision Fund 2, with an expected total capital of about  US$108 billion , after landing Apple, Foxconn, Microsoft, and the National Investment Corporation of the National Bank of Kazakhstan as possible investors. 
  August 2019:  WeWork released its  IPO prospectus , which was met with scrutiny from investors. The prospectus exposed the company’s high burn and conflicts of interest involving then CEO Adam Neumann. 
  October 2019:  WeWork  shelved  its IPO indefinitely. It also looked to slash its workforce and slow down its expansion to conserve cash. SoftBank was reportedly in discussions to own at least 70% of WeWork with a US$4 billion to US$5 billion injection into the co-working company. 
  November 2019:  SoftBank cut WeWork’s valuation by 83% to  US$4.9 billion . The co-working startup had a valuation of US$47 billion before the IPO fiasco. 
 Meanwhile, the Japanese investment giant posted an  operating loss  of US$6.5 billion in the quarter that ended September 2019. The result was mainly dragged down by its Vision Fund and Delta Fund segment, which reported an operating loss of US$8.9 billion. The two funds had recorded an operating income of US$3.6 billion in the same quarter a year ago. 
 During the month, it was also reported that SoftBank had bagged just  US$2 billion  for its second Vision Fund. To make matters worse, it was earlier reported that PIF and Mubadala were reconsidering the amount of their investment in the new fund as well. 
 SoftBank’s stock fell to 4,253 yen (US$39.78) at the end of the month. 
  January 2020:  News came in that Oyo had asked some of its 600 employees in China and about 1,200 of its staff in India to leave, worsening Vision Fund’s  investment woes . 
 A separate report noted that in total, SoftBank-backed firms had laid off 2,600 people in the first week of the month – on top of the 7,000 people that were let go in the past year. 
  April 2020:  With the decline in value of its tech bets, coupled with the “deteriorating market environment” due to Covid-19, SoftBank said it expected to report less-than-favorable results for the year ended March 31. 
  May 2020:  SoftBank booked an  operating loss  of around US$13 billion for full-year 2019, falling by US$31.7 billion compared to its positive results last year. This was mainly because of its Vision Fund losing US$17.7 billion in valuation. According to the company, it had lost almost US$10 billion from its investments in Uber and WeWork alone in the fiscal year. 
 Post-Covid rally 
  June 2020:  In SoftBank’s annual general meeting of shareholders, Son noted that the equity value of SoftBank’s assets had  returned to pre-Covid-19 numbers . The rebound was partly due to an increase in the company’s Alibaba shareholding. 
 Son also mentioned that the demand driven by Covid-19 boosted the value of its investments in a number of Chinese companies, including Ping An and ByteDance. 
  July 2020:  SoftBank bought US$2.7 billion of its own shares in June. Some of its high-profile investments, including Uber and Slack, have also seen their share prices soar. 
    
     
 This momentum drove SoftBank’s shares to close at 6,418 yen (US$60.04) on July 12, almost double the closing price of 3,732 yen (US$34.91) in March. 
 “There are incredible investment opportunities that are opening up for companies that are sitting on enough dry powder to take advantage,” Marcelo Claure, SoftBank International CEO and SoftBank Group chief operating officer, told the  Financial Times . “We’re a lot more cautious […] but it feels a lot better to be in the position where we are today.” 
 After a few days, it was reported that the firm was mulling a sale of part or all of its stake in UK chipmaker Arm Holdings either through a private deal or a public stock listing. The development comes after Apple announced it would expand the use of Arm-designed chips for its Mac products. 
 If SoftBank chooses to pursue a listing, Arm may go public as soon as next year and fetch a potential valuation of  US$44 billion .

652518,Go for Go: The programming language that could improve your job prospects," Ride-hailing platforms, food delivery apps, and search engines all have something in common: They serve vast amounts of users and perform multiple transactions simultaneously. 
 Because of that, the code that builds these platforms needs to be designed for scalability. Otherwise, these apps risk losing dissatisfied users. 
 “Today, if you need more than three to five seconds to open an app, people might shut down the app because they find it too slow,” says Yi Ming Ng, managing partner of deep tech innovation platform  Tribe Group . 
 One programming language that allows developers to increase the speed of their apps and platforms is Go. 
 Designed for the internet age 
 Go – also known as Golang – was designed by Google developers in 2007. It’s syntactically similar to the programming language C, but it comes with additional features that enable more efficient coding, such as  garbage collection  and  memory safety . 
 “Go was designed to handle the sort of workloads and operational characteristics that Google has,” says Qing Ze Hum, a product manager at Tribe. He adds that the language is key to allowing Google’s search engine function – which is estimated to execute  70,000 searches per second  – to run smoothly.

 Ng contrasts this to other programming languages like C, C++, and Python, which were built in the ‘70s and ‘80s. 
 “They were built before the huge internet wave that came about in the 2000s, while Go was designed for the current economy, which is increasingly reliant on large-scale cloud computing services for many users,” he says. 
 This makes Go the ideal backend programming language for applications and platforms that regularly handle high traffic. Some examples of systems that are built on it include ride-hailing super app Grab, food delivery app Foodpanda, fashion e-retailer Zalora, and online platform Shopee. According to Ng, these companies “need hundreds of developers” who can code with Go. 
 “All these super apps and all these startups that process so much data every second – they need to use this language,” he says. 
 The language for the mid-career developer 
 Go is especially useful for mid-career tech professionals, who are at the stage where they’re put in charge of the process of creating code and managing development pipelines. As more apps and platforms adopt the use of Go to build their backend, it will be all the more crucial to be familiar with the programming language. 
 “It’s not so much about just writing code anymore – you’ll be in charge of the process itself. You’ll be the one that does the final push, where you put it live or you handle production. You’ll write that in Go,” Hum explains. 
 Entry-level developers can also pick up the programming language, but he says it’s unlikely that they’ll use it at that stage of their careers. This is because Go was designed for  concurrency : It’s used to execute different codes within a program simultaneously as opposed to simply building a singular part of a program – this allows applications built with Go to handle large amounts of users. The topic isn’t conventionally taught at the beginner level, says Hum, because at that stage, programmers just need to focus on getting their code to work. 
 Hum further explains this by comparing the capabilities and applications of other coding languages. 
 “People use R because it’s a great language for generating quick statistical insights. But it can never survive in production environments because it’s too slow. That’s why in the end people use Python for data science. Each language has its own benefits and uses. Similarly, for Go, you need to understand not just how to code in it, but what to actually use it for.” 
 Bridging the talent supply-demand gap 
 Go has steadily climbed the ranks in recent years to become the  most in-demand programming language  for employers. But despite its prevalence in the tech world, Ng says there’s a lack of developers who are proficient in it. 
 “It’s hard to find Go developers,” he explains. “A lot of them were self-taught: They were existing software engineers, they learned it themselves, and they picked up the skills. But there isn’t a sufficient supply of them,” he explains. 
 This gap in the supply and demand for Go programmers, Ng says, will only grow wider if it isn’t addressed as soon as possible. 
 “More and more companies are needing fast and huge computational power systems, and if we don’t start today to train this pipeline of developers, this will be an even bigger problem.”

 This issue inspired the launch of  GoSchool , the first programming school in Singapore to teach the use of Go, in a joint venture by blockchain ecosystem platform  OpenNodes , Ngee Ann Polytechnic, and skills validation platform  Indorse , in collaboration with Sea. Partnering with the government-backed  SkillsFuture  program, the digital programming school aims to bridge the talent supply and demand gap by offering a number of courses on Go. It recently launched one for Singaporeans and Singapore permanent residents, which costs S$666.67 after the SkillsFuture subsidy and grants students a training allowance of S$1,500 each month over a period of eight months. 
 GoSchool also offers participants a guaranteed apprenticeship at Sea – the parent company of Shopee, gaming platform Garena, and digital finance service SeaMoney – which Ng says makes the institution one of “few programs” where Sea guarantees an apprenticeship. 
 “We want to support the leading tech companies across the region,” says Ng. “From a lot of the top leading corporates’ perspective, they have the money, but they just can’t find the right candidate. We want to solve that.”

652451,How a potential merger can shake up Vietnam’s $23b ecommerce market," Hoang Vu said he has recently closed his fashion-focused stores on  Tiki   and  Sendo , arguably the two most notable homegrown names in Vietnam’s fast-growing ecommerce space. The merchant cited high return rates and fees as well as a lack of support for sellers as his reasons for the move. But beyond these concerns, Vu also said that online marketplaces Shopee and Lazada as well as social media platforms Facebook and Instagram have proven to be much more effective in attracting Vietnamese consumers.

  Tech in Asia  spoke to five local merchants who sell on Vietnam’s ecommerce platforms. They seem to prefer Shopee because it’s easier to open a store and to post and advertise products. Its app and website are also user-friendly for both vendors and shoppers, resulting in higher sales. They also said that new sellers often start out  on Shopee to gain sizable online traffic before branching out to other online marketplaces. (  Tiki, in response, says its return rates are less than 1%, and that it has a strict onboarding process because of its focus on authentic goods.)  
 The stakes are high in the battle to win over buyers and sellers. After all, an online marketplace needs to appeal to both parties. Along with Indonesia,  Vietnam is one of the most promising ecommerce markets in Southeast Asia, thanks to its  over 97 million population   and growing middle class as well as high smartphone and internet penetration. Between 2015 and 2019, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ecommerce in Vietnam was at 81%, higher than Thailand and Malaysia, according to a  2019 report  from Google, Bain &amp; Company, and Temasek.

 Vietnam’s nascent ecommerce space only had 4.2% retail penetration in 2018, according to a 2019  whitepaper  on the ecommerce sector published by the country’s Ministry of Industry and Trade. 
 Thus, there’s a lot of untapped opportunity. 
 The government is aiming  to reach US$35 billion in ecommerce turnover  by 2025. It’s definitely an ambitious goal in the economic era after Covid-19. Competition in Vietnam is now primarily a four-horse race: local champions Tiki and Sendo, which have raised hundreds of millions in US dollars, versus regional heavyweights Shopee and Lazada. 
   ﻿  ﻿  ﻿   
  Note: B2B refers to business-to-business, and C2C refers to consumer-to-consumer.  
 But with news of a  potential merger  between Tiki and Sendo swirling around since the beginning of this year, this competition could take a new turn. 
 In recent years, Vietnam’s local platforms appear to have a poor track record against their international rivals so far. Grab has taken the country by storm since its entry  in 2014 , leaving little room for domestic ride-hailing players such as Be and FastGo. Vietnamese social networks also can’t take off due to the king-like status of Facebook. 
 In this kind of scenario, can domestic ecommerce players escape a similar fate? 
 It’s also worth noting that unlike Be and FastGo, which only surfaced after Grab secured its position in the market, both Tiki and Sendo got into the game much earlier than their foreign competitors. Combining these two companies, which has a  valuation of well over $US100 million each,  could result in the biggest merger in Vietnam’s tech space and allow both players to attract even more funding to go up against their international rivals. 
 Given the nascent ecommerce infrastructure in Vietnam and tightening investor wallets, joining forces would at least help Sendo and Tiki survive in the long haul. However, it’s not an easy task to topple Alibaba-backed Lazada and Shopee, which benefits from being a sister company to  cash cow Garena.  
 Tough nut to crack 
 Like many other countries, Vietnam implemented strict social distancing measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. But it lasted for only two weeks in April, thanks to the government’s  effective pandemic response . Online shopping was expected to rise amid the crisis, but the results didn’t meet expectations. While industry sources note that ecommerce app usage has held steady, estimated web traffic to Lazada, Tiki and Sendo decreased in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Shopee is the exception, however, with its Q1 numbers going up this year. 
    
 Dang Dang Truong, who monitors ecommerce development in Vietnam for regional firm iPrice Group, said the surge in online shopping was mostly for essential items while demand for fashion and electronics products, which have been growth drivers for Vietnam’s ecommerce sites in previous years, dropped. 
 Even before the pandemic hit, a number of notable Vietnam-focused shopping sites had shut down in 2019, including Adayroi, the ecommerce unit of  local conglomerate Vingroup,  as well as Lotte.vn and Robins.vn, the online marketplace of  South Korean giant Lotte   and  Thailand’s Central Group  respectively. Niche e-tailer Leflair filed for bankruptcy in May amid  allegations from angry suppliers.  
 Ecommerce in Vietnam is promising, but being in the early stages of development means that acquiring new consumers and getting them to buy are costly for companies. Much of the spending has been driven by consumers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City,  who account for about 70%  of ecommerce transactions nationwide. It’s also expensive to deliver products to end consumers who are spread out in 63 cities and provinces. 
 Buyers, especially first-time online shoppers in the country’s lower-tier cities, are not easy to sway. The 2019 government whitepaper on ecommerce indicated that 83% of respondents are still concerned about the quality of online products. The surveyed consumers also cited other hurdles, such as poor delivery services, complicated online purchasing and payment procedures, and higher and opaque prices compared to offline stores. 
 There’s also the “cash is king” mentality. Among ASEAN countries, around 90% of online purchases in Vietnam are still paid via cash on delivery – the highest in the region, according to a  2019 report  by Standard Chartered Bank. Indonesia and Thailand are distant second and third placers at 65.3% and nearly 48.5%, respectively. 
 A crowded space 
 Shopee, which entered Vietnam in 2016 was the last among the “Big Four” ecommerce marketplaces to set up shop in the country. Nevertheless, Sea Group’s ecommerce unit has had a grip on the market, according to third-party estimates of web and mobile user metrics seen by  Tech in Asia . 
 To entice consumers, players have to burn money for discounts, shipping subsidies, rewards for merchants, and sassy online campaigns that include popular Vietnamese celebrities. VNDirect, a local stock trading company that also provides market research,  estimates that a new entrant  has to spend at least 142 billion dong (US$6 million) a year to capture 1% of market share. 
 These platforms are also differentiating themselves from one another. While Shopee targets female shoppers in urban areas and brands itself as the place for bargains, Tiki has embarked on an Amazon-style path. TikiNow, the company’s in-house logistics arm, guarantees a two-hour delivery for certain products, an offer similar to Amazon Prime.

 Like Amazon, Tiki prides itself on a customer-centric approach, betting on higher-income consumers who are more willing to pay for authenticated products. In contrast, Sendo wants to onboard and tap into lower-income consumers who live outside Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. 
 Having entered Vietnam in 2012, Lazada has lost the top spot in some key metrics to Shopee in the Q3 2018, according to an  iPrice report  that ranks the country’s top 50 ecommerce players. Lazada underwent a  regional leadership reshuffle  in late June. The change comes amid cultural clashes within the company and challenges with understanding local nuances, reported  Reuters  and the  Wall Street Journal . 
 When asked by  Tech in Asia  about its performance in Vietnam, a Lazada spokesperson said the platform serves “over 70 million annual active consumers,” calling it “a metric that demonstrates its leading position.” 
 She added that “app downloads and web traffic are neither meaningful metrics” nor the company’s focus. Newly appointed CEO Li Chun is also expected to “strengthen Lazada’s competitive advantage through data technology application and business localization across the six countries, with Vietnam being a key market.” 
 United front 
 To tackle bigger rivals, Tiki and Sendo have raised substantial funding rounds. 
   ﻿   
   ﻿   
 When  Tech in Asia  asked about a possible merger, both companies declined to comment. However, Tiki and Sendo have submitted an application for consolidation to the Vietnam Competition and Consumer Authority, according to the agency’s  2019 annual report  and people familiar with the matter. 
 The merger can bring together “two assets with very complementary capabilities,” driving massive synergies with the potential to raise further funding, says Akshay Jayaprakasan from research firm Redseer Consulting. 
 Consolidation “makes a lot of sense” in Vietnam as the number of international investors interested in acquiring large, cash-burning assets has shrunk, a former regional investor who was involved in one of Sendo’s funding rounds tells   Tech in Asia  . “I think in terms of valuation, an ecommerce company in Vietnam is still available at a better valuation than markets like India or Indonesia,” the source adds. 
 In addition, Vietnam’s “horizontal ecommerce may be too crowded at this point” to attract funding, says Jeffrey Paine, managing partner at Singapore-based Golden Gate Ventures. “Investors will be looking at other areas such as B2B commerce, social commerce, and video commerce enablers and also areas that support ecommerce – from payments to logistics,” he points out. 
    
    
 The potential Tiki-Sendo merger was first reported by  DealStreetAsia  in February. The structure of the deal remains unclear, but from a regulatory standpoint, there’s a good chance that the companies would have to maintain their respective brands to avoid hitting a level of market concentration that could violate Vietnam’s Competition Law 2018, according to a legal consultant. 
 So what can homegrown players bet on to compete with regional titans like Shopee and Lazada? 
 In theory, the merged entity will have a wider reach across the country. Tiki has been mainly targeting digitally mature consumers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City while Sendo focuses on lower-tier cities, says Redseer’s Jayaprakasan. 
 The consulting firm’s analysis suggests that both companies could potentially scale faster because they have very different business models: Tiki focuses on business-to-consumer while Sendo is mostly consumer-to-consumer. They also have a diversified portfolio of offerings across categories. 
 “We believe the merger augurs well for profitability and growth in the long run. With the merger, the market has three sizable players with a strong set of capabilities competing against each other,” Jayaprakasan explains. 
 One of the challenges for Tiki is to expand its product offerings without compromising on its reputation as a marketplace for authenticated items, according to Dang of iPrice. At present, Tiki says it has about 10 million SKUs across 35 categories. 
 “For Tiki, Sendo might be the missing piece,” points out Dang. “If we look at China, Alibaba has Taobao and Tmall. Taobao focuses on quantity and cheaper products to target first-time and new buyers, who can later move to Tmall as the demand for online buying rises.”

 An e-wallet can also be a crucial factor, as it enables ecommerce players to expand into financial products, which is what Alibaba has done. Tiki, however, also doesn’t own a digital wallet while Sendo’s SenPay was  hailed by the State Bank of Vietnam  as among the five e-wallets nationwide that carried out 95% of the market’s total transaction value in Q2 2019. 
 While a Tiki-Sendo merger looks good on paper, integration at this scale would be extremely complex. 
 To enable faster delivery, Tiki established TikiNow Smart Logistics in September 2019. By running its own in-house logistics network, inventories and warehouses, Tiki is following not just the Amazon model but also Asian giant JD.com, one of its own investors and shareholders. In contrast, Shopee relies entirely on third-party logistics providers. In December 2019, it  partnered with Grab  to offer one-hour delivery for buyers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City – a direct challenges Tiki’s two-hour delivery service. 
 A Tiki spokesperson told  Tech in Asia  that fast delivery remains one of its core competitive advantages, adding that the company has achieved an average delivery time nationwide of only 1.5 days. “In order to do this, we have hugely invested in the fulfillment center systems in key cities across the country and built an in-house delivery fleet, along with closely collaborating with trusted third-party logistics providers,” the representative says. 
 All bases covered 
 While a Tiki-Sendo merger looks good on paper, integration at this scale would be extremely complex. Even if they stick to their own brands post-merger, both sides need to leverage their respective strengths and avoid stepping on each other’s toes, some industry insiders say. 
 On social media groups for ecommerce merchants, discussions about the potential deal have been widespread. But most sellers expressed doubts about whether this would really benefit them. 
 Addressing this concern, Tiki tells  Tech in Asia  that “merchants on Tiki marketplace are a key pillar that we have focused on in all business activities.” The spokesperson adds, “We make great efforts to ensure the online business of our merchants to be as seamless, effective and convenient as possible, but still aligned with the verified process.” 
 But ecommerce merchant Thanh Vu, who makes most of his sales from selling cosmetics and home appliances on Shopee, believes that homegrown sites like Tiki and Sendo haven’t paid enough attention to individual sellers like himself. When Shopee was new in Vietnam, it reached out to Thanh Vu and recruited him to join the platform. He eventually migrated from Facebook and now also runs training workshops for other individual sellers. 
 His advice for local players to avoid losing ground on its home turf? “To operate a successful online marketplace, you have to care about both the buyer and the seller.” ",Thu Huong Le,0,10,"[(0, 0.035809945), (1, 0.76716495), (3, 0.19700852)]","['app', 'iPrice', 'Facebook', 'VNDirect', 'Lotte', 'Ecommerce', 'United', 'Amazon', 'Sendo', 'Shopee', 'ASEAN', 'Reuters']","['Singapore', 'Hanoi', 'Garena', 'Asia', 'Alibaba', 'India', 'Sendo', 'Malaysia', 'Taobao', 'Lazada', 'Vietnam', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia', 'China']"

 The global internet giant is investing US$4.5 billion for a 7.7% stake in Jio, RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani said during the company’s 43rd annual general meeting. The latest capital injection puts Jio’s total funding within the last few months to over US$20.6 billion, selling a roughly 33% stake in the company. 
  See:  Reliance Jio continues to headline Asian fundraising in June   
 With the deal, Google and RIL will work on a customized version of the California-based company’s mobile operating system. 
 “Getting technology into the hands of more people is a big part of Google’s mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai in a video during the general meeting. 
 This is also a key part of Google’s decision to invest  US$10 billion  in India over the next five to seven years through its recently announced Google for India Digitization Fund. Pichai added that Google’s investment into Jio is the fund’s first, and the biggest bet it will make from this point on. 
 “Our target for capital raised is now complete and we now look forward to only adding strategic partners who share our vision in each of our current and future businesses,” Ambani shared. The chairman was referring to the company’s rights issue, investments into Jio Platforms, and an investment by oil major BP into RIL’s fuel retailing business. 
 Jio currently runs the largest telco in India. With nearly 400 million subscribers, it aims to digitize India’s 1.3 billion people.

 Say hi to millennials and zoomers . Realme knows the way to a young user’s heart — the company holds press conferences in school campuses and nightclubs and relies mostly on online marketing and sales channels. 
 
 A focus on fun . Young users spend a lot of time on entertainment apps, so Realme makes sure that it’s entertainment features are  entertaining . For example, it launched a performance-enhanced handset for gamers and provided distinct sound modes for different activities. 
 
 Oppo is huge . Having the third-largest smartphone maker in Southeast Asia behind your back helps. Realme uses Oppo’s manufacturing facilities for production, and it is also  maybe  using Oppo’s offline retail shops.

 Will we ever see a Southeast-Asian Netflix? 
   
On one end, you have video-streaming companies like Disney+ ramping up hiring in Southeast Asia. On the other?  Liquidation  and  acquisitions . 
 So is the video-streaming industry  a boom or bust business  in Southeast Asia? 
 
 
 It remains attractive.  Why else would Netflix and HBO still look to expand and grow in this region? Similarly, Gojek is also branching out into  video streaming with GoPlay  (🔒). 
 
 So what’s the problem?  Every company wants a piece of the streaming pie, so they’re fighting to develop or acquire exclusive content. But let’s not forget that exclusivity is expensive. As a result, these moves have left everyone with a small content library and a hefty subscription price tag.  
 
 Can viewers still chill?  Maybe not. Viewers now have to get multiple subscription plans at higher rates, and the content they watch might even get scrapped if the viewership is low.

652358,Safety first: Democratizing smart security management solutions," Singapore moved into the second phase of its circuit breaker measures on June 19, with malls and non-essential businesses reopening for business. Depending on the location, the public response was either  enthusiastic  or  lukewarm . 
 Either way, it’s clear that people are ready to be out and about again. And aside from their continued adherence to social distancing rules and wearing masks, there’s an expectation that life will proceed safely and peacefully – something that security systems enable and ensure. 
 Silent guardians in need of an update 
 “The thing with security systems is that if you actually notice them, then that means something is going wrong,” says Ian Stewart, CEO of security software-as-a-service company  Security Risk .

 CCTV cameras and patrolling security guards in malls, hospitals, condominium estates, and other everyday places  go a long way toward providing peace of mind  to the public. Such operational services also play an important role in maintaining the integrity of high-value locations such as military installations and mining and gas operations, among others. 
 However, the sector is sorely lacking in technological innovation, with 95% of security operations around the world still using paper-based and other manual solutions, according to Stewart. The technology focus in the industry has been mainly on hardware, which only really helps if there’s a person physically watching the cameras. “[Cameras are] good for monitoring and getting you notifications, but they don’t manage the key part of security; you don’t really have control of an area unless you have people there,” he says. 
 Also, if the person monitoring the video feeds has to check on something that the cameras picked up, that would leave no one left to continue the monitoring. The dynamic ability to see what’s going on and then allocate resources accordingly is currently missing. 
 Smart solutions do exist in the market, but cost and accessibility issues abound, given the heavy reliance on expensive proprietary hardware and licenses. Additionally, since many facilities that need security are located in remote areas, they must be able to operate in low-bandwidth environments where internet connectivity is spotty at best. 
 “Every site or location is a little bit different,” says Stewart. “A good system really needs to be flexible with regard to how it’s going to be used.” 
 Democratizing smart security solutions 
 These are the kinds of issues that Security Risk is trying to address with its Security Risk Manager (SRM) Platform. It is made up of four different applications that, when put together, provide a full suite of security functions ranging from scheduling guard patrols and enabling the instant filing of incident reports to sending quick response personnel, among others. SRM Portal, the key management interface, is web-based, with a mobile version in the works. The other three apps run on iOS and Android phones, covering the spectrum of what people use throughout the world. 
 “In the event of an incident, anyone who has the mobile app – guards, responders, clients – can send out an emergency alert,” Stewart explains. “Supervisors in the control room can assign responders, and once the incident is resolved, the personnel on the scene can write up and submit an incident report on the spot.” 
 All this data – incident reports, images, voice recordings – are stored on the cloud so clients will always be able to access it. “If you want to know what patrol was performed and what was found three years ago on a particular day and at a particular time, you can go and find that info any time,” he says.

 In order to build a system that offers all these functionalities but is also affordable and able to operate in difficult environments, Security Risk’s tech team put in time and effort to do research on security problems and define the exact parameters it wanted its system to adhere to. To this end, the team went to Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea to look at security operations there; the locations were chosen for their inherent  infrastructural   difficulties . 
 “Our CTO analyzed things from the technology point of view, deciding what the information and accountability flows should be, along with other things that were happening in the physical environment that we needed to recreate in the virtual environment,” says Stewart. 
 The team then went to local mobile phone shops, picking out the cheapest smartphones available so as to determine how scaled back, technologically speaking, the firm’s software needs to be in order to work anywhere in the world. The low price point for such phones also helps with cost and accessibility. 
 “We wanted to make sure that we would build a software solution that can tap on existing hardware, such as basic smartphones and laptops,” the CEO says. 
 The product took 12 months to build, followed by over a year of extensive testing, also done in Timor Leste and with local companies as test partners. Stewart says there have been no issues or interruptions to service yet. He also points out that since the app has a very simple user interface that features mostly icons and hardly any text, it’s quick and easy to deploy across different locations and among personnel of varying educational backgrounds. 
 Meeting the security needs of the future 
 The point of these stress tests was to make sure that the SRM platform can operate well regardless of the location, the related foundational infrastructure in place, or the size of the client. 
 “We’re working with five to six partners at the testing phase at the moment, some of which are relatively small, but others are mining and gas companies, or NGOs,” Stewart says. “So it’s quite a flexible piece of software. The sweet spot is for a medium-to-large security business, but it’s going to absolutely address even the needs of a small firm.” 
 The CEO also feels that in the current climate, with businesses thinking more about automating as many functions as possible to reduce the number of people on-site, the SRM platform’s ability to provide real-time information remotely will prove to be useful and important. 
 There may be some reluctance on the clients’ part to make the leap to smart solutions, given the prevalent entrenchment in the current manual and paper-based systems. But Stewart believes the return on investment and time from making that switch will create benefits that are bigger than the cost of making the transition. 
 “We are also putting a robust customer support system in place as the product goes to market,” the CEO says, emphasizing that they “will be there when a client wants to reach us.”

652330,Tributes pour in for Skype founder Toivo Annus who passed away at 48," Skype co-founder Toivo Annus has passed away on Sunday at the age of 48 due to an “unexpected illness.” 
 “I inform you with the utmost sadness that last weekend, on 12 July, our beloved husband, dad, entrepreneur, and investor Toivo Annus succumbed to an unexpected illness,” his wife was quoted as saying by local media reports. An intimate funeral service with family and close friends will be held.

 Annus was known for his work at Skype, where he had led the engineering team until ecommerce major eBay acquired the company in late 2005. 
 He then moved on to focus on his investment firm Ambient Sound Investments, which he established together with three other colleagues at Skype. 
 The Estonian entrepreneur was also an active investor in various tech projects. He’s one of the early backers and advisors of Southeast Asia’s tech scene, pouring in funding to Sea Group’s gaming business Garena in 2008. That was before funding had taken off in the region. 
 Other investments in his portfolio include RedMart, Red Dot Payment, Pomelo Fashion, Coda Payments, and VC fund Jungle Ventures, among others. 
 The tech community in the region remembers him as a “fearless investor” and a “brother.” 
 “Toivo was a fearless investor who was led by the courage of his convictions. He participated in every round we ever raised, making his mark by doing so even in 2015 when we were in the wilderness, and his support made the difference between Coda’s survival and failure,” Neil Davidson, executive chairman at Coda Payments, told  Tech in Asia . 
 “We will remember him for his unwavering support of our dream, for everything that he taught us along the way, and for the example that he set, always conducting himself with humility and backing it with immense substance. We will miss him,” Paul Leishman, president at Coda Payments, added. 
 Bernard Leong, who is now head of machine learning and AI at Amazon Web Services ASEAN,  tweeted : “I am saddened by this as he was an investor to my former startup and we corresponded on and off on perspectives on new companies even [as] I moved on from my startup.” 
 Eric Su, CEO of Philippine-based Exnetwork, recalled: “As one of the co-founders of Skype, he would tell me stories of how they did things roughly or messily in the early days. This would comfort me as there was a lot of mess made at the early days of Lifebit […] He would give me valuable advice like the time when I was confused where to take the company […] He said, ‘Do not fight the jungle, the jungle always wins.’ Well, today the jungle has won and taken away a wise lion.” 
 James Chan, CEO and co-founder of Ion Mobility, shared that his business relationship with Annus extended into a friendship between their families. 
 “His quiet demeanor underscored his work ethics and no-bullshit stance, regardless of whether it was in engaging with an entrepreneur or a fellow investor. Despite [our] being almost a generation apart (nine-year gap), I’ve always looked up to Toivo as the business-investor brother I never had,” Chan told  Tech in Asia . “It took years for us to get close, and just like that, he’s no longer with us. Southeast Asia will mourn the loss of one of our own, one taken too soon from us.” 
 Vinnie Lauria, managing partner at Golden Gate Ventures, described him as a “personal friend.” 
 “While many people knew him as a founding team member of Skype, I don’t think many folks realized the impact of his investments to corners of the world like SEA and Africa. He invested in everything, from old-school ecommerce to the latest in drone technology. He was incredibly smart, and a sharp entrepreneur that felt comfortable asking the really hard questions, and founders respected him for it. He was very analytical and put a lot of thought into his words. Most founders would have referred to him as their favorite investor/advisor,” he told  Tech in Asia . 
 He added, “He was an inspiration to me, especially as we were getting the firm off the ground back in 2012. The impact he created in the early SEA ecosystem cannot be measured and his loss weighs heavy on the founders he backed out here. He took huge risks backing Southeast Asia founders before most of the current VCs even existed.” 
 “Toivo was one of the earliest backers of Jungle Ventures and also for many of the first-generation entrepreneurs in Southeast Asia,” Amit Anand of Jungle Ventures said. “He was always supportive of the entrepreneur no matter the situation and always tried to be helpful to anyone who came across him. No wonder there are so many people in Southeast Asia sharing this loss.” 
 Meanwhile, Silver Lake Partners’ Mark Gillett, who previously served as chief operating officer at Skype,  remembered  Annus’ legacy at the tech giant. 
 “Toivo was generous with his time, and I will always be grateful for the time he shared helping me understand ‘Skypers.’ I expect that the over 50 other companies and founders he supported will have experienced that same Toivo since he moved on from Skype in 2005,” he  wrote  on LinkedIn.

652379,"Grab, Gojek used to intimidate activists in Indonesia"," June was a rough month for Indonesian human rights activists. At a time when most people were staying home to ride out the Covid-19 pandemic, and hence relying on web-based delivery services to procure groceries, meals, and daily necessities, unknown perpetrators appropriated these channels to intimidate activists in an attempt to cow them into silence. 
 For the people who received these threats, this was a new form of coercion. By hijacking the victims’ on-demand app accounts and sending a slew of drivers to their home or workplace, the underlying message was clear: we know where you are.

 One of the victims was Mitha Setiani Asih, the editor-in-chief of Lampung University’s student publication  Teknokra . Asih had planned to host an online round table on June 11 about the racial injustice suffered by Papuans in Indonesia. It was a sensitive topic, and she and her guests aimed to discuss and unpack the Indonesian government’s oppression of the indigenous people living in its easternmost province. 
 One day before the event, Asih was hanging out with two of  Teknokra ’s editorial staff in their secretariat room. It was just past 7 pm, and she was watching a YouTube video when her phone chimed. A WhatsApp notification from an unknown number appeared on her screen: “What’s the address for the food delivery?” 
  Heaps of unwanted food  
 “At first, I thought it was a spam message, so I ignored it,” Asih told  KrAsia . “Then, suddenly, there was a chat notification from the Gojek app, asking for my address for food delivery.” This caught Asih off guard. Nobody present had ordered anything using the app. 
 Thinking there was a glitch in the system, she opened the app to report the problem. To her surprise, there was a long sequence of orders she did not place. They were all on their way to her, so she couldn’t cancel them. WhatsApp messages and calls from Gojek drivers started flooding in, overloading and then freezing her phone. She realized that someone had hijacked her Gojek account – but it wasn’t for the perpetrator’s own benefit. 
 Panicked, Asih uninstalled the Gojek app from her phone. That didn’t stop the fake orders, which were sent to multiple locations. It wasn’t long before delivery drivers showed up one by one. Accompanied by her friends, Asih met them and explained the situation. 
 “Some drivers were mad and didn’t believe that my account had been hijacked. They thought I was pranking them,” she recounted. 
 In the past, there have been cases where Grab and Gojek drivers continually harassed customers who they deemed rude or abusive. Wanting to avoid any conflict, Asih and her friends were moved to a safe house provided by the regional Alliance of Independent Journalists. In all, more than 50 orders had been placed via Gojek under Asih’s name by whoever had stolen her personal details. 
 Meanwhile, 363 kilometeres away, Tantowi Anwari and his wife Salbiyah faced a similar problem at their home in South Jakarta. At 8:53 pm, Anwari received a WhatsApp message from an unknown number. “Don’t overdo the fake orders. This is just a warning from me. Be careful when you leave your house,” wrote the sender, according to a screenshot that Anwari shared with  KrAsia . 
 Initially, Anwari ignored the message, but then the sender attached a picture of Anwari’s ID card. A few minutes later, around six GrabFood drivers showed up at his house. 
 “It was really strange as my husband almost never ordered food deliveries, it was usually me,” said Salbiyah. “When I asked if he made those orders, he said no. He didn’t order anything, and we were together in our room, so I knew he was telling the truth.” 
 She uninstalled the Grab app from her husband’s phone and then went out to talk to the drivers. Salbiyah explained that they had not placed those orders and asked the drivers to tell their colleagues not to pick up any more orders placed through his account. She still paid for the delivered food by cash, reasoning that the drivers were also victims of these fraudulent orders. 
 That was only the beginning. GrabBike drivers started to arrive. Anwari received an e-mail receipt of GoPay transactions amounting to 300,000 rupiah (US$21), even though he didn’t initiate the transfers. 
 Next morning, Salbiyah’s Gojek account was compromised too. Again, drivers for car and bike rides showed up at the couple’s house, and people were delivering food ordered through her account. Salbiyah’s GoPay balance of 180,000 rupiah (US$13) was drained. In total, the couple lost around 680,000 rupiah (US$48), a significant sum for them. 
 Despite the physical distance between these cases, Anwari was set to be part of Asih’s round table discussion. Asih said other participants received threats via WhatsApp too. 
 Speakers at similar events, like one hosted by Amnesty International, have had to deal with spam calls from unknown foreign numbers as well as “Zoombombing.” And a researcher who has been critical of state affairs on social media said his WhatsApp account was hacked before a message calling for riots was broadcast; the incident led to incitement charges leveled against him. 
  Blaming the customer  
 Asih, Anwari, and Salbiyah reached out to Grab and Gojek’s customer service centers to find out what was happening to their accounts and hopefully resolve their issues, but they didn’t find the feedback they received to be particularly helpful. “They only told me to wait an hour until my account is disabled,” said Asih. 
 Salbiyah felt Gojek’s customer service representative was more focused on blaming her instead of offering assistance. “They kept on insisting that I shared my OTP [one-time password] or let other people use my account. They wouldn’t believe that my account is hijacked, claiming that the system is well-protected,” she said. 
 It took around two hours for the companies to disable the victims’ accounts. Grab told Salbiyah that it couldn’t disable Anwari’s account right away as the company needed to “follow procedures.” Furthermore, when Salbiyah requested a detailed order history, Gojek didn’t give her one. Instead, they only sent a generic e-mail stating that her account had been reset. 
 Gojek said it covered the charges related to Asih’s case, specifically delivery fees for the drivers involved, and that she did not suffer any financial losses. The company told local media that there was “no hacking” involved and that it has reached out to Asih to follow up on her complaints. Gojek also stated that it maintains a “willingness to cooperate with the police to enforce the legal process.” But Asih said Gojek has not done this and has not provided any information about how her account was exploited by parties with malicious intent. 
 Salbiyah was less fortunate. Gojek has not provided refunds for the losses she incurred and still refuses to release the transaction history of her own account to her. 
 “It was very hard to report our case,” said Anwari. “The companies’ customer data protection system is very weak.” 
 A Gojek spokesperson told  KrAsia  that what happened to Asih was a “prank” and “did not involve any hacking of our system or user data.” 
 “A perpetrator got hold of Mitha’s delivery details from outside of our ecosystem and used an alternative Gojek account to send her multiple food orders, requesting for cash on delivery,” the spokesperson said in a statement to  KrAsia . They also claimed that Asih and the drivers involved didn’t suffer any financial losses. 
 Gojek has deployed an AI security system called Gojek Shield, which is meant to send notifications to users when they may be victims of fraud. It also includes an emergency button in Gojek’s app for any user who suspects their account’s security has been compromised. Gojek masks phone numbers so that drivers cannot retain customers’ information and contact them later on. It also offers insurance coverage for victims of GoPay fraud. 
 “We also work closely with authorities and enforce necessary legal processes to help users and partners who have experienced cases of fraud and pranks,” said Gojek’s spokesperson. The company representative did not comment on Anwari and Salbiyah’s depleted balances. 
 Asih rejected the claim that the ordeal was a prank. “It was like my account was operated from two different devices. I saw a list of orders I didn’t make on the history tab, and messages from the hacker to the drivers confirming the delivery orders. I never wrote those messages,” she said. 
 When contacted by  KrAsia , Grab claimed that they have poured “significant investment” into their anti-fraud functionality, GrabDefence, which the company said reduces fraudulent activities on their platform to below 1% of all transactions. 
 “It includes real-time and early detection measures that use machine learning models crunching millions of [pieces of] booking data in real-time looking for fraudulent patterns,” said a Grab spokesperson. False orders can be detected based on behavioral patterns and how long it takes to complete orders. 
 This covers GrabFood transactions too. Grab maintains a dedicated line where drivers can report fraudulent orders. A flag will lead to a review of an account’s activity. Problematic accounts are suspended or deactivated. 
 “Grab will only act if we have full confidence and we also take progressive actions against suspected fraudulent actions. We also try to spread awareness with driver-partners and passengers, to discourage fraud,” said the spokesperson. 
  Systemic weaknesses  
 These three cases are unusual in that they show no signs of attempted hacking, such as alerts that flag log-in attempts on different devices or OTP requests. The victims also claimed that their phones were operating normally before the tidal wave of food and rides that they didn’t order came. 
 “If the hacking doesn’t occur on the client side, it is likely to be done through the system provider itself,” said cybersecurity researcher and consultant Teguh Aprianto. 
 However, another researcher, Alfons Tanujaya from computer security firm Vaksincom, said that fake orders can be placed without hijacking an account. The perpetrator only needs to create a fake account using the victim’s name and place the orders. However, this method doesn’t match these cases as all victims received notifications on their phones. But Tanujaya pointed out a major flaw in both Gojek’s and Grab’s systems – the inability to detect unusual orders. 
 “They should have been actively evaluating weaknesses in the system and making improvements to prevent the same loophole from being exploited again,” he told local media outlet  Tempo . 
 Both experts think that Grab and Gojek need to ramp up their security systems to prevent third parties from using their apps for intimidation purposes. Aprianto suggested an alert feature for login attempts from unrecognized devices. For instance, Facebook requires users to verify logins from a recognized gadget. 
 Grab and Gojek also need to tighten their user registration processes to prevent fake accounts from joining and using the platforms. Currently, for both companies, a new user only needs to provide an email address and a phone number to create an account. Aprianto said Grab and Gojek should “ask for valid ID [with a selfie] before completing the registration process.” 
 In previous years, fake accounts and abnormal orders have caused a lot of problems for both companies. In 2019, Instagram influencer Nazla Alifa shared on her Instagram Stories that someone placed multiple fake food delivery orders under her name. She also complained about Gojek’s slowness in handling the situation. 
 There were also cases where GoFood and GoShop merchants exploited fake accounts to enrich themselves. The merchants used three separate phones, pretending to be drivers and customers who placed orders from their store. In February 2020, a restaurant owner managed to con around 400 million rupiah (US$28,000) from Gojek’s bonus point system using this fraudulent order tactic. He reportedly managed 41 fake driver accounts, 30 fake restaurant accounts, and several customer accounts. 
  Moving forward with no resolution  
 For now, neither Gojek nor Grab has a new strategy for tighter security, even though their current setups are riddled with flaws and have left some of their users unguarded against targeted fraud and intimidation. 
 Asih, Anwari, and Salbiyah have been left traumatized. Asih and Anwari no longer use any ride-hailing or food delivery apps on their phones. After ditching Gojek, Salbiyah now uses Grab. It’s a matter of necessity because she needs transportation for her daily commutes. Even so, she is still spooked by the sight of online app drivers who hang around in her neighborhood.

652223,Boom or bust: Making sense of the video-streaming market in Southeast Asia," Over the past few months, there has been a flurry of activity within the video-streaming space in Southeast Asia. Some news was positive, such as GoPlay receiving its  first independent funding  round and Disney+  ramping up its hiring as it looks to expand into the region . 
 However, these announcements came around the same time as the shocking news of  Hooq’s liquidation  and  Iflix’s sale to Tencent . Bearing these new developments in mind, I’d like to highlight the themes at play and examine whether streaming companies in Southeast Asia can work out a sustainable business model to turn a profit.

 The Southeast Asian market remains highly attractive 
 Similar to other mega-segments such as ride-hailing, mobile wallets, and ecommerce, video streaming is a strong beneficiary of key macroeconomic tailwinds that include a growing middle class and a tech-savvy population, as well as rising internet and smartphone penetration. This means that the potential spoils for winners are enormous in this market: According to  Media Asia Partners , the online video industry in Asia Pacific (excluding China) will grow at roughly 15% per year to reach US$23 billion dollars by 2024. 
 Large streaming players like Netflix and HBO look to expand and grow in this region, as their home markets have become increasingly saturated. Choosing to enter a high-growth region not only accelerates the top line, but also improves overall profitability by reducing content costs per subscriber and increasing bargaining power against production houses. 
 Similarly, regional powerhouses such as Gojek are looking to branch out into video streaming as a way to grow their all-encompassing ecosystems, engage users for longer, and increase customer lifetime value on their platforms. 
 But the video-streaming model is fundamentally broken 
 To understand why the current model is broken, we first have to go back to the heyday of Western online video streaming. 
 Netflix embodied absolute convenience as a content aggregator. With its flat monthly fee, viewers could gain access to thousands of hours of content from any device, at any time, right at their fingertips. 
 However, as more and more companies started to jump on the bandwagon – some of which were content producers wanting to get a piece of the action – players needed a way to differentiate themselves. Unfortunately, that caused a shift in strategy toward developing or acquiring exclusive content, triggering an arms race for blockbuster content. Netflix started leaning heavily toward original programming, and Disney retaliated by pulling its content from the streaming site in 2019. 
 This series of actions cascaded into a vicious cycle that created more inefficiencies and arguably left all parties worse off than before.  Netflix’s library is now a fraction of what it used to be . In addition, higher investments in original content has led to rising subscription prices. 
 In light of this “shotgun” approach to content development, most originals are likely to be pulled if viewership is low, lending unsatisfactory endings to unsuccessful shows and often leaving viewers frustrated. For content studios, these exclusive deals also mean their content is locked within a single platform, and studios are unable to maximize consumer reach and potential monetization. 
 With less choices in each platform, consumers now require more than one subscription plan to multiple video-streaming platforms at higher rates – which, strangely enough, is starting to add up to the cost of traditional cable TV. In fact, piracy has been creeping back again after steady years of decline, according to  a recent report . 
 The relevance to the Southeast Asian market is twofold. First, some of these players, like Netflix and HBO, are operating in this market with little to no modification in their global strategy. Second, most Asian-based operators are heavily influenced by the West and look toward these bigger boys for a “successful” playbook. 
 Fundamentally, video streaming is a scale business — a critical mass of subscribers is needed to eventually hit profitability. However, in a fragmented market without a consolidated viewer pool, the future may not be so bright unless there is some form of market rationalization. 
 For independent platforms, there will likely be no clear path to profitability. For platforms owned by majors like Netflix and Apple, the typical strategy is to be a “loss leader,” focusing on growing their overall ecosystem rather than making profits directly. 
 Understanding of the local dynamics is key 
 So how will all of this eventually shake out? While no crystal ball can tell us for certain, I suspect that streaming companies with a deeper appreciation and understanding of the region will have a meaningfully greater chance of surviving. 
 At the expense of being Captain Obvious, I advise companies not to treat Southeast Asia as a typical monolithic region like China or the US. It is an incredibly diverse region filled with a plethora of cultures, languages, and people, and execution strategies would need to be carefully crafted to suit the customs and traditions of each country. 
 One key difference between Western and Southeast Asian markets comes to mind: Given the abundance of over-the-top media services, relatively lower disposable income, and traditionally higher piracy rates in the region, consumers are less willing and able to pay for content, unlike in the US market where consumers are likely to have multiple subscriptions and can possibly sustain a few winners. 
 Recently, some streaming players are opting for an advertisement-based video-on-demand (AVOD) model instead of a subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) model, given the considerably higher tolerance for advertising in this region. Since the AVOD model monetizes differently, companies will require significant investments to build out a sales team and capabilities in developing adtech infrastructure. 
 Streaming companies may also want to consider breaking away from traditional playbooks. While proponents of the “content + distribution” strategy argue that it creates a sustainable competitive advantage and reduces reliance on content studios, the strategy has yielded mixed results so far. 
 Cracks are starting to surface, what with higher market fragmentation, reduced consumer convenience, and fragile unit economics, and companies need to be more cautious of coupling the two together. Instead, they must double down on core value proposition as content aggregators and focus on distribution platform innovations (i.e., improved customer service, new product features, better user interface, and deeper localization). They will then have more time to figure out and monetize distribution (i.e., creating downstream sales capabilities in the AVOD model). 
 It is crucial to recognize that video-streaming players are not only competing with each other but also with a wide range of substitutes: social media, short-form content, user-generated content, free to air, cable TV, digital games, piracy, and more. 
 It is in everyone’s collective interest to ensure a sustainable way to monetize and distribute content in a cheap and convenient manner for consumers so they would be willing to pay for it. With limited resources and time, these companies will need to quickly figure out what their priorities are and where they want to focus their efforts on. Time is ticking, and cash is burning.

652259,"A Chinese smartphone brand’s rapid rise in Southeast Asia, India"," 
  Image credit: Realme 
 
 India and Southeast Asia have emerged as the heated battleground for smartphone makers, especially those from China. Amid such tight competition, it seems unlikely that a new player can get into the game, but budget brand Realme seems to have done exactly that. Starting out of Oppo, Realme was spun-off as an independent company just two months later, in May 2018. 
 The company’s rise in Oppo strongholds India and Southeast Asia has been meteoric, shipping  10 million phones  globally in the first 14 months of its founding. In the first quarter of 2020, Realme became the fastest-growing smartphone brand in Southeast Asia, with 173% year-on-year growth despite the Covid-19 pandemic, according to  Counterpoint Research . 
 Realme and Oppo as well as Vivo and OnePlus are smartphone brands under the umbrella of China-based multinational BBK Electronics. 
 
  BBK Electronics’ structure, explained 
 
 In July 2018, Oppo vice president Sky Li Bingzhong spun off Realme and became founder and CEO of the new company. 
 Like many others in Oppo and Vivo’s management, Li started out at parent firm BBK Electronics in the early 2000s and was among Oppo’s earliest employees. 
 Having spent five years developing Oppo’s overseas presence from scratch, Li tells  Tech in Asia  that he saw an opportunity in the smartphone market dominated by players like Samsung and Xiaomi. 
 He notes that while local ecommerce platforms in India and Southeast Asia offer plenty of affordable options, young people often have difficulty finding a smartphone that ticks all the boxes. Such consumers “are drawn to flashy, stylish phones, but most of them aren’t prepared to spend their money on high-end phones,” Li adds. 
 To reach the tech-savvy target users, Realme relies mostly on online marketing and sales channels. Moreover, the company’s press events are often held at unconventional venues, such as school campuses and nightclubs. 
 Because of its focus on young consumers, Realme has a smaller product portfolio across a narrower range of price points. 
 In 2018, the company launched its first budget phone in India. Called Realme 1, it captured around 14% of the country’s smartphone market in Q1 2020, surpassing Oppo, according to  Counterpoint . In Southeast Asia, Realme held 13% of the market in Indonesia and the Philippines during the same period, ranking fifth and third place, respectively. 
    
     
 India has one of the  most active  social media user bases in the world. In order to understand user habits in the country, Li took to the streets every day for a month to observe people. This led to the creation of F1, Oppo’s first product in the market. The F series is a “selfie-centric” line that turned Oppo into the country’s second-largest smartphone maker by sales value in August 2016. 
 “In India, the people are utterly passionate about taking selfies. From the prime minister to ordinary people, everyone does it,” shares Li. “If you look at Indian social media, there are a lot of the videos shot from a selfie angle.” 
 Li says this observation made him think about the possibility of creating a brand that uses selfies as a major selling point. 
 He adds that communicating with users and building word of mouth online is Realme’s “lifeline.” The team devoted a lot of time to reading online ratings and reviews on ecommerce platforms like Flipkart to learn about consumers and understand their preferences.

 The camera and image quality are among the big draws of Realme phones. 
 To woo young users, the company also highlighted entertainment features, including giving users more customization power. Some of its smartphone models come with different sound modes for movies, games, and music. Realme also launched a performance-enhanced handset for gamers. 
 In the cutthroat smartphone market, optimizing efficiency and cost is key. Li believes that part of Realme’s quick rise is its “short distribution channel” strategy, which involves reducing the number of intermediaries required to deliver its products to consumers. 
 Generally, smartphone companies like Oppo and Vivo rely heavily on offline sales channels and distributors, giving them a wider market reach. In comparison, players such as Realme and Xiaomi that primarily use an online strategy are targeting specific groups of users. 
 A leg up 
 Realme may be a separate entity, it still benefits from Oppo’s supply chain and manufacturing facilities, giving the former secondary brand an advantage over its competitors. 
 The rivalry between Realme and Xiaomi has been  heating up  lately. 
 The companies have a number of products competing in the same price range. For example, Realme C2, Realme 5, and Realme 5 Pro go head-to-head with Redmi A, Redmi, and Redmi Note Pro, respectively. 
 While it seems like Realme was following Xiaomi’s overseas playbook with the asset-light model and online marketing strategy, their approaches are different in reality, Will Wong, research manager at IDC, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 The main difference is Realme’s access to Oppo. Not only is Oppo the third-largest smartphone maker in Southeast Asia, but it also focuses largely on offline sales and promotion. Their offline models in Southeast Asia are almost identical, says Wong, with the brands sharing the same suppliers, distributors, and business development partners. 
 Oppo is also one of the few smartphone firms that has its own manufacturing facilities for production, which Realme also shares. In comparison, companies like Xiaomi and Huawei hire contractors to do the work. Since intermediaries charge a margin for their services, this can mean less profits for the phonemakers, says Matthew Xie, an analyst at Canalys.

 Reports from Chinese media suggest that Realme taps into Oppo’s offline retail channels as well. According to  36Kr , Oppo is planning to  ramp up  its offline efforts in the second half of 2020 and its offline stores in China are already selling Realme products. 
 Asset-heavy strategies like setting up brick-and-mortar stores is a huge investment for any smartphone firm, let alone young brands that have a lean product line. 
 When Realme entered the Southeast Asian market, Xiaomi was caught off guard because it was undergoing major restructuring at the time, Xie says. It didn’t act quickly enough to head off this threat, and as a result, Realme was able to take a chunk of the market pie from Xiaomi in places like Indonesia, for example. 
 A Xiaomi spokesperson, however, pointed out that the reorganization was implemented in China, so it’s unlikely to have slowed the company’s response to new competition in overseas markets. 
    
     
 Brands seem to be pivoting away from traditional offline-heavy or purely online models. Xiaomi has been expanding its offline presence, setting up flagship stores in Southeast Asia. However, these measures also eat into its already-thin margins. 
 According to a Q3 2017  report  by Counterpoint, the operating profit per unit of Xiaomi smartphones was US$2. That’s small compared to what Vivo, Oppo, and Huawei were generating – the companies’ profit per unit during the same period was US$13, US$14, and US$15, respectively. 
 Realme’s profit margin is likely to also be at the lower end, given its similarity to Xiaomi. Madhav Seth, chief executive officer of Realme India, said in a 2018 interview that the company operates with a profit margin of  less than 3% . 
 With such slim margins, Realme has limited capacity to bankroll initiatives such as expanding online and offline distribution. It also means that finding more revenue sources becomes important. 
 Compared to how much it earns from its handsets, Xiaomi’s accessory business is much more profitable. In Q1 2020, the gross profit margin was 8.1% for Xiaomi’s smartphone segment and 13.4% for its internet of things and lifestyle products segment. The company has been strengthening its IoT play by making serious  investments  in recent years. Like Xiaomi, Realme is also moving beyond smartphones with the release of smart TV sets in India. 
 The challenge for the Chinese firm now is to continue its healthy growth even after the pandemic. As such, Realme boss Li has set ambitious targets for the company. For this year, it aims to double its shipment of smartphones to 50 million units from 25 million units in 2019. It’s also looking to cross the 100 million units mark in two to three years.

 Aside from Lu, the company has also removed three other board directors – David Hui Li, Erhai Liu, and Sean Shao – and appointed two new independent directors. 
 Earlier this month, the company said that about  US$300 million  in revenue was fabricated last year, its internal investigation found. It then terminated former CEO Jenny Qian and ex-chief operating officer Jian Liu from the board as well as some 12 employees involved in the fraudulent transactions. 
 Lu’s resignation from the board was also proposed. The co-founder, however, managed to stay on as chairman, as the attempt failed to get enough votes.

 Founded in 2017, Luckin said it was operating over 4,000 stores across China as of the end of last year. But its shares and market value dipped after the company announced an internal probe into the fabricated transactions. Last month, its shares were delisted from Nasdaq after Luckin received two delisting notices from the exchange amid the investigation. 
 Earlier in June, Lu also stepped down as chairman of Car Inc., the car rental firm he founded, amid the Luckin scandal. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(1, 0.25569627), (2, 0.7439526)]",['Nasdaq'],['China']
651780,Reliance Jio continues to headline Asian fundraising in June,"    
     
   
 ||item|| 
  This article is part of a  series of monthly reports  where we keep track of tech funding activities in Asia.  
 In June, over US$11 billion in funding was poured in the region across upwards of 400 deals, topping last month’s count of more than 300. 
 Getting the lion’s share of the total amount is  Jio Platforms , which scored a total of US$3.7 billion in funding from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, L Catterton, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and TPG Capital. 
 Last month’s investments into Jio, the digital services arm of India’s Reliance Industries, took its total funding within two months to  US$15.2 billion , including fresh capital from Facebook, KKR, and General Atlantic. 
 Jio’s fundraising spree highlights the appeal of India’s internet market to foreign investors. Jio, which runs the largest telco in the country, has a lofty ambition of helping India’s 1.3 billion people go digital. 
 India is also an important market to US ecommerce giant Amazon, which is reportedly in talks to buy a stake in Jio rival Bharti Airtel. There were also reports saying that Google is looking to get into the mix with a possible investment into Vodafone for a 5% stake. 
 Besides Jio, late-stage investments into China- and India-based companies such as  Byju’s , Nio, and  CapitalBio Technology  topped last month’s funding scene. 
 Overall, 60% of the total funding in June went to China, followed by India (17%), Japan (8%), and Singapore (7%).

 We often talk about corporations getting disrupted by startups. Amid the pandemic, startups themselves are facing disruption. 
 Last week, Zilingo said it had let go another 12% of its workforce. Our Indonesia journalist Putra Muskita looked  behind the scenes to see how the fashion ecommerce “soonicorn”  has been trying to cope and found that Zilingo has been diversifying into fast-moving consumer goods and personal protective equipment. It’s a challenging maneuver, though.

 We also caught up with Oyo Indonesia to get a sense of how it’s pivoting and dealing with  pushback from workers and hotels . It remains in a challenging period: Hotel bookings may be recovering but they’re still far from ideal, our  Tech in Asia Indonesia  counterparts uncovered. 
 On the brighter side, Singapore journalist Melissa Goh looked at how  HR tech firms are taking advantage of the rise of remote working . Glints, for example, is seeing more demand for offshore job placements. Even in Japan, many companies now see remote working as the default setup. “Such a move was previously unimaginable,” says Toyofumi Miura, CEO of Tokyo-based employee analytics startup Laboratik. 
 It seems the world at large is still fumbling in the dark. We’re seeing unprecedented economic disruption and behavioral change on a massive scale.

  Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai / Photo credit:  Pix Spark  
 
 During the internet giant’s Google for India event, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the Google for India Digitization Fund will focus on four core areas that are important to the country’s digitization. 
 First, it aims to make information and digital tools affordable and accessible to Indians in their own languages. Google also wants to use the funds to help build new products and services tailored to the country’s unique needs. 
 Besides that, the company looks to aid local businesses with their digital transformation processes as well as leverage tech and AI for social good in areas such as health, education, and agriculture. 
 “As we make these investments, we look forward to working alongside Prime Minister Modi and the Indian government, as well as Indian businesses of all sizes to realize our shared vision for a digital India,” Pichai said. 
 According to the chief exec, India has already been making strides in going digital, especially small businesses. 
 “Just four years ago, only one-third of all small businesses in India had an online presence. Today, 26 million SMBs are now discoverable on [Google] Search and Maps, driving connections with more than 150 million users every month,” he added. 
 The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed the adoption of digital tools such as digital payments, which has been key in bringing small businesses to become part of the formal economy, said Pichai. Google already has a presence in the space with Google Pay, its digital wallet platform that enables users to pay with their smartphones. 
 Recently, India’s digital potential has attracted big-name investors. In April, Facebook announced a massive US$5.7 billion investment into Jio Platforms, the digital services subsidiary of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). Jio has since brought on other foreign investors such as KKR, General Atlantic, Intel, and Qualcomm, among others. 
 Jio acts as RIL’s umbrella platform for its digital initiatives, including music streaming, online payments, online grocery, and telco services. It wants to enable India’s 1.3 billion people and small businesses to go digital.

Tax season to an accountant is like shipping a new app is to a startup. It’s a hell of a ride.
 Accounting app BukuWarung wants to make this a little easier by helping micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) manage all of their transactions, including credit, expenses, and sales. 
 The startup bagged an undisclosed amount of funding in  a pre-series A round  led by Quona Capital, pushing its total funding into eight-digit territory. 
  Accounting for small merchants  
Launched 10 months ago, BukuWarung’s founders said that: 
 
 
 Over 600,000 merchants  have signed up for the platform 
 
 Around 200,000  of these vendors are actively using it every month 
 
 It’s part of  Y Combinator’s S20 batch 
 
 Moving forward, the startup aims to serve 1 million small business owners in the next two months. It’s also looking to launch payments and microlending solutions as well as provide working capital to its partner merchants to help them bounce back from the Covid-19 crisis.

 Would you join an auction for used cars? 
   
Imagine an eBay for used vehicles. 
 That’s the concept behind TiinTiin, an Indonesian auction-based marketplace for used vehicles. 
 It has recently  raised more than US$2.5 million  in a seed round led by its CEO Rolf Monteiro, along with Amand Ventures and PT Luminary Media Nusantara. 
  Calling once… calling twice… sold!  
Launched in April, TiinTiin helps to improve the buying and the selling of used vehicles. 
 
 
 For the buyers:  It pre-assesses the vehicles with a 300-point assessment system and offers personalized financing options. 
 
 For the sellers:  It manages the entire process so sellers don’t have to deal with buyers who pull out of a sale or barter for cheaper prices. 
 
 Since its inception, the company claims it has achieved over US$7 million in annualized gross merchandise volume and more than 1,200 annualized transactions. 
 Looking ahead, TiinTiin wants to enter other Southeast Asian markets by 2021 as it aims to capture at least a 10% market share in the region. 
 That’s quite a feat, considering that there are bigger players like 
 
 
 Malaysia-based Carsome , which has over US$77 million in total funding and is backed by the likes of Gobi Partners, MUFG Innovation Partners, and Convergence Ventures. 
 
 Singapore’s Carro , which has US$108 million in total funding and backed by SoftBank, B Capital Group, and Singtel Innov8 
 
 Indonesia’s BeliMobilGue , which raised US$30 million and appointed an ex- executive of payments firm Ovo as its new CEO.

651898,TenCube’s 2009 pitch deck saw it raise $1.5m from Paytm’s parent firm,"     
 ||item|| 
 Q&amp;A 
  1️⃣ When was the deck created?  
  
  It was created in 2009.
  
  2️⃣ How much did you raise?  
  
  We raised US$1.5 million  from One97 , now more commonly known as the company that runs Paytm.
  
  3️⃣ Has the company’s direction changed? If yes, how and why?  
  
  Directionally, it was almost identical to how we saw it. But one thing that was completely off the charts was that Android kicked in, and App Store revenue in the end was way larger than we originally thought. 2007 was the launch of the first iPhone, and Android was tiny – no one was buying apps on the phone in general. This completely changed in a matter of a few years.
  
  4️⃣ Lessons learned?  
  
  Founders know their business better than anyone. There were many investor naysayers and also other suggestions and ideas – they were wrong, but we seriously doubted ourselves, as we were also first-time entrepreneurs.
  
 🌱  Editor’s note: TenCube was  acquired by McAfee  in July 2010. Its founder, Darius Cheung, went on to start  99.co . His other co-founders, Rishi Israni and Varun Chatterji, started  Rotimatic  and  Seventh Sense AI , respectively.

652018,Tackling a taboo: Cannabis tech on the rise in Asia," Drugs such as cannabis are considered taboo in Asia, especially in Singapore, where airplane disembarkation cards are printed with “Warning: Death penalty for drug traffickers under Singapore law.” 
 But despite the stigma, attitudes toward marijuana have recently started to change in the region. Following the liberalization of the drug’s use  across North America and Europe  over the past decade, there have been signs of increasing social acceptance, easing regulations, and even steps toward legalization in countries such as Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and Malaysia.

 Subsequently, the “green gold rush” began, with both startups and nations eager to share in the windfall. A report by cannabis research firm Prohibition Partners projected Asia’s legal cannabis market to reach  US$5.8 billion by 2024 . In the same vein, Future Food Asia estimates the total sector, which includes recreational marijuana and hemp, to be worth US$12.5 billion by that year. 
    
 Another mind-boggling statistic: Asia is home to the highest number of cannabis users in the world, standing at an estimated 86 million in 2019, according to Future Food Asia. These numbers exceed North America and Europe, despite the two continents moving earlier to decriminalize the use of cannabis. Asia’s total count is set to grow even further, with increased access to medical marijuana and the continued easing of regulations in the region. 
    
 Even in Singapore, which punishes drug traffickers with an iron hand, interest in cannabis derivatives is blossoming. Called cannabinoids, these chemical compounds are found in the cannabis plant and can be used therapeutically. The substance has been the subject of research by the government’s National Research Foundation, which launched a S$25 million (US$19 million) initiative in 2018 to look into  producing the compound , without “the need to grow the plant.” 
 Large cannabis corporations in North America are also branching out into the Asia-Pacific region to get their share of the potentially huge market. For instance, Canada’s Canopy Growth, the world’s largest cannabis company, took root in Australia in 2018 to expand its footprint in the region. 
   
 Another Canadian cannabis producer, Bluesky Biologicals, also expanded to the land down under in 2018, while establishing its hemp growing facilities in China, where it grows some 20,000 acres of the plant. 
 In February 2016, Australian authorities gave the green light to medical marijuana, opening the floodgates to investment opportunities and cannabis-related businesses. As a result, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) has seen a flurry of pot-related stocks make gains in the last couple of years. 
 It’s a “no-brainer” for big cannabis corporations to make inroads into Asia Pacific, says Kitty Chopaka, the founder and CEO of cannabis-focused consulting firm Elevated Estate. “Asia has a great climate and lower labor costs,” she says. “It’s also a very big untapped market, unlike in the US and Europe, where the cannabis market has matured.” 
 The grass isn’t greener on the startup side 
 While analysts are singing praises about the potential of Asia Pacific’s cannabis market, startups that  Tech in Asia  spoke with paint a less rosy picture. Many of these firms have pointed out regulatory uncertainty and a lack of support from governments as pain points, which is understandable, given the relative newness of the sector and its historical backdrop in Asia. 
 “Starting a cannabis company in 2018 was not easy, and placing our headquarters in Singapore did have its challenges,” says CannAcubed founder Glenn Davies. His startup, which specializes in growing industrial cannabis, also aims to “educate, drive policy, and support the Asian cannabis industry.”

 While the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) tells  Tech in Asia  that it wasn’t involved in helping CannAcubed establish itself, it recognizes that “many companies set up in Singapore, as it is an easy place to do business.” 
 To conduct business in the city-state, “CannAcubed must ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including drug laws, in Singapore,” says Goh Wan Yee, senior vice president at EDB. 
 Currently, CannAcubed is registered in Singapore as a biotech firm, with its headquarters there serving as a “a holding entity.” The company’s operations in the city-state are legal, as it doesn’t partake in the use, production, or distribution of cannabis-related substances within the country’s borders. What it does is cultivate industrial cannabis, called hemp, in China. 
 The early bird will definitely get the worm 
 For Davies, the most difficult challenge his startup has faced was raising capital. Although “funds were flowing in the US and Canada, little focus was on the [Asian] region,” he says. “But the early bird will definitely get the worm as more and more cannabis-related investment opportunities present themselves.” 
 Chopaka echoes this sentiment, saying “the lack of funding is usually the biggest problem that every startup has.” In Thailand, even local marijuana-focused startups “have major difficulties entering the local market,” she adds.

 The two founders have a point: Investment in cannabis startups in the region are few and far between, with only one startup in India (HempStreet)  closing a public fundraise  this year. However, the seed round was backed by a US firm, rather than investors in the region. 
 One early bird in Asia’s startup scene is venture capital firm Expara. Headquartered in Singapore and with an office in Bangkok, it has raised US$30 million to invest in cannabis-related startups in the region. 
 “We think the market is going to grow quickly starting now,” Douglas Abram, the chief executive of Expara,  told the  Bangkok Post  . “Thailand could be the cannabis tech hub, not just of Southeast Asia but of the world.” 
 While Expara was in talks with a Thai company that builds LED lights for indoor grow houses and another that makes homegrown bioforming devices that control the lights and temperature for cannabis plants, the firm couldn’t be reached for updates on its US$30 million fund or the upcoming investments. 
 Chopaka, who has collaborated with Expara, explains that the fund, like most others worldwide, has been put on ice due to Covid-19, and that Expara could be focusing on conserving funds for its other investments. 
 Startups need more help 
 Thailand, which has been viewed as the country that has helped  push cannabis law reforms , has drawn flak for not cultivating a conducive environment for cannabis startups to set up. According to Chopaka, startups hoping to operate in Thailand face the issues of “the law, stigma, nepotism, and the current system’s corruption.” 
 Case in point, the Thai government has so far issued over  800 permits  to mostly hospital and research facilities to develop medical extracts from cannabis, but none of these permits have gone to startups. 
 “Licenses are very restricted,” says Chopaka, adding that only government departments and entities that work with them are allowed to have one. “Even in the private sector, a few doctors that have been granted licenses can’t distribute cannabis in their private practices yet. They need to be in a government-based clinic to do so,” she explains. 
 That’s why it’s important, she says, for startups to focus on tech that is “non-plant touching” – meaning they serve other purposes like product packaging or have growth monitoring systems – so that they can quickly pivot their offerings to serve other purposes. Planting systems designed for cannabis plants, for example, could also be used to grow other cash crops like sugarcane.

 Prohibition Partners defends Thailand’s move to be tightfisted in handing out licenses, calling it a move to “protect national interests” by utilizing its own natural resources, universities, and labor in cannabis production. 
 “There will be expertise and knowledge that Thailand can glean from foreign partnerships, but it’s important that they promote a domestic industry so they’re not reliant on international imports and capital,” says Eoin Keenan, Prohibition Partners’ communications director. 
 Apart from this, the firm says up-and-coming countries such as Thailand, South Korea, and Japan need to help startups navigate through regulation, as it’s one of the main issues they face. 
 “Governments need to provide clear legislation and a concise framework that supports cannabis businesses and walk them through the process,” says Keenan, adding that they must also dedicate time and resources to establishing the nascent industry and a new regulatory system. 
 Although Thailand says developing its medical cannabis industry would be  one of its top priorities , there have been complaints of an undersupply of the plant itself. It’s this problem that startups like Thailand-based Craft Pot hope to solve with its tech.

 The startup manufactures reusable fabric pots that target the home-grower market. The container has a “root window,” which allows the grower to monitor the root and soil of the plant, and comes with “low-stress” training e-material to help new growers learn about cultivation and troubleshoot soil and root problems. 
 “We can’t promote our products as for growing cannabis yet, as cultivating the plant at home is still illegal in Thailand,” says Craft Pot founder Sutthikead Sitivoradechkul. “However, we’re developing our product so that we will be ready to bloom when the time comes.” 
 That moment might come sooner than expected. Late last year, the Thai health ministry said it was  ramping up medical marijuana legalization  efforts that would soon allow all locals to cultivate up to six cannabis plants at home and sell their harvest to the government to turn into medical marijuana. 
 Another homegrown startup that is hoping to ride on the supply wave is 88 Cannatek. Chopaka, who works with the firm, tells  Tech in Asia  that 88 Cannatek offers a consultancy service to help these would-be farmers learn from industry experts in “mature” markets like Canada and the US to ensure that their products meet export standards. 
 The startup is also aiming to spread awareness on the hemp plant’s financial viability. Although hemp fibre sells for 5 baht (US$0.16) per kilogram, which is less than sugarcane’s 8 baht (US$0.26) per kilogram, it’s more valuable in the long run. 
 “Sugarcane takes over a year to become harvestable, but for hemp, you can harvest it every three months,” says Chopaka. “Besides the fibre, the rest of the hemp plant – its flowers, its seeds – those are even more valuable.”

 However, 88 Cannatek’s founder Pornprasith Sibunruang says Thailand’s “overly bureaucratic procedures” are delaying the development of its own cannabis industry. 
 “For example, there are too many government offices involved,” says Sibunruang. “They should all be integrated into one office so that Thailand can take full advantage of this high-value cash crop.” With the right moves, the country can become a global leader in the industry, he says. 
 Despite its issues, Thailand’s cannabis industry will grow to US$661 million by 2024, predicts Prohibition Partners. But Elevated Estate’s Chopaka is skeptical about this figure. 
 “It can be a realistic number if the actual industry opens up soon. But at the same time, I don’t see most of that amount being from small-time businesses or startups. Rather, [it will be from companies] controlled by bigger producing players that are linked to the government,” she says. 
 What’s good about cannabis? 
 When Bangkok  opened its first medical cannabis clinic  in January this year, hundreds of “mostly elderly Thais” queued up to receive free vials of cannabis oil, wrote  Thailand Medical News . The product contains the active ingredient cannabidiol (CBD), which the country’s health ministry said is used to treat migraines, insomnia, neck pain, and muscle stiffness.

 But that’s not the only form CBD products take in the country; they come in tablets, oral sprays, chocolate wafers, and even traditional potions. It’s a move that mirrors what’s been done by American producers, who have flexed their creative muscles to use the versatile ingredient, adding it to cheeseburgers, toothpicks, and breath sprays. 
 Although the US Food and Drug Administration has only approved it  for the treatment  of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the regulatory body hasn’t exactly endorsed its use for other ailments the products using CBD claim to help with. 
 The jury’s still out on the true efficacy of CBD in treating conditions,  such as anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain , but further research is underway to discern exactly how. 
 It’s also important to note the distinction between CBD, which isn’t intoxicating, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), another cannabinoid that’s known as the “controversial” part of cannabis. THC, due to its psychoactive properties that make people high, is the element that complicates legislation. 
 Hemp, though, contains a significantly lower amount of THC, with no more than 0.3%. By comparison, marijuana typically contains 5 to 20 percent THC. Due to the difference between these levels, hemp and marijuana are regulated differently under the law. 
 Another advantage that hemp has over its relative is its other uses. Hemp, or industrial cannabis, is used to make a variety of commercial and industrial products, including rope, textiles, clothing, shoes, food, paper, and even bioplastics – BMW, for one,  is using it  in its “i3” electric car. 
 “Hemp can also pretty much be grown in any climate and almost anywhere on the planet,” says Davies. “It’s also been proven to absorb more carbon dioxide per hectare than any forest or commercial crop and is therefore the ideal carbon sink.” 
 Where does the money lie? 
 With most cannabis startups in Asia and even in Thailand adopting a wait-and-see approach, Chopaka suggests that profitability lies in cultivation – soil, sensors, vertical farming systems, packaging, or even blockchain tracking tech – rather than in growing cannabis itself. This serves as a backup plan in case legislation or regulations take too long to ease. 
 Vertical farming systems, in particular, have commanded a lot of attention in the agritech world. Startups like US-based AeroFarms and Germany-headquartered Infarm both raised US$100 million last year. Not only would the efficiency of vertical farming be beneficial for cultivating cannabis, it could also be adapted to grow several crops at once, with its multilevel vertical stacks. 
 Most of the region’s earning potential is in China and India, says Future Food Asia. China is currently the largest hemp producer in the world, with its hemp industry valued at around US$1.2 billion. It also holds the majority of cannabis international patents. 
 India, on the other hand, is home to the highest number of cannabis consumers in Asia, at 38 million. This number is attributed to legal THC, CBD, and hemp production, while the use of bhang, an edible mixture made from the buds, leaves, and flowers of the marijuana plant, has been added to food and drinks in the country for thousands of years. 
    
     
 Having said this, many other countries could also unlock the potential to make money off of the burgeoning interest in the cannabis bud. The Malaysian government, for instance, was  reportedly in talks  with Australian cannabis giant THC Global to develop policy frameworks and a path to legalizing the medical usage of marijuana. 
 The Philippines has also budged on its anti-narcotics laws, even in the midst of President Rodrigo Duterte’s crackdown on drugs. The country is pivoting to  pass a bill  in the House of Representatives that could pave the way for the medical use of cannabis. However, the country’s Dangerous Drugs Board said this wouldn’t  necessarily translate  to higher chances of legalizing medical marijuana. 
 Even Japan has taken an interest in conducting research for the usage of medical CBD brand Epidiolex, which was crafted as a treatment for two forms of childhood epilepsy. Made by UK-based GW Pharmaceutical, the trials, which are to be tightly controlled in a hospital environment, are exempted from Japan’s Cannabis Control Act, which bans cannabis compounds in general. 
 Reading the tea leaves 
 Although seemingly untapped potential lies within Asia, with just 89 million of its 4.5 billion strong population currently using marijuana, much of the region’s promise remains locked up behind legislation. But Elevated Estate’s Chopaka says that the region is looking to Thailand as an example – be it for the good or the bad. 
 “Many observers in the Philippines and in Malaysia, for example, tell me they have been watching what Thailand does,” she says. But these people don’t just observe for inspiration; they’re examining how the country runs things. “They want to see how bad it can get when shit actually happens.” 
 For now, because so much is unknown about the cannabis black market, no other country in the region will legalize medical marijuana, Chopaka adds. 
 
  Photo credit: 123rf 
 
 The black market price for cannabis in Southeast Asia stands at around 350,000 baht (US$11,000) per pound, which is much more expensive compared to that of legal cannabis in the US, which costs just US$800 a pound, says Chopaka. “[Suppliers in Asia will] see no point in establishing a national cannabis supply chain when they can’t beat prices on the black market. They’ll just import from the US,” she continues. 
 The founder sees Thailand’s cannabis industry as an emerging one, pointing out that a lot of investments are still at a “very early stage” due to regulations flipping recently. At the same time, cannabis-related businesses like Craft Pot don’t have buyers for their products and services yet due to the restrictive criteria for permits in the country. 
 “Investors in this space need to have a deep understanding of the cannabis industry, as well as the understanding of the current and possible future laws that may change,” she cautions. 
 Given that Thai startups have such difficulty entering the industry, Chopaka doesn’t see foreign startups having an easy time, either. That is, unless they have a lot of cash to burn. 
 Meanwhile, Prohibition Partner’s Keenan is optimistic, calling cannabis a “burgeoning market.” He believes that once Asian countries advance to decriminalize the use of marijuana, demand will increase exponentially. 
 Like Chopaka, however, Keenan says that growth is dependent on legislative progression, which can be hard to predict. But ultimately, both believe that the grass is green for the cannabis industry in the future. 
 “Try to picture yourself going down to your neighborhood pharmacy in Thailand and asking for ‘something that makes you happy, but also sleepy,’ and have a professional go through a database of cannabis products to prescribe you exactly what you need. That’s a future I foresee 10 years down the line in Thailand,” concludes Chopaka.

 Dear readers, 
 A powerbank rental service is probably one of those divisive ideas: It’s either regarded as brilliant or foolish. 
 For a while, people were heaping scorn on it, with a son of a Chinese billionaire even promising to eat poop 💩 if the idea ever took off in China. He’s since deleted the social media post. Another indicator is how Meituan-Dianping, which bowed out of the space some years ago, has  jumped back in . 
 Let’s say you want to start a powerbank rental business in Southeast Asia. Will it work? We did a deep dive to find out if it’s viable in the region. 
 ⇒     Read: $Billion or fool’s gold?     
 Our report, covers: 
 
 Unit economics with scenario analyses 
 Total addressable market (TAM) 
 Market opportunity and challenges 
 
   
 My own interpretation of our report is yes, you can certainly make money from this concept. 
 As a founder, you should take note of these points: 
 
 The trend is likely in your favor, particularly if 5G gets widely adopted, because that means future phones will consume more power. But you have to pray that battery tech doesn’t improve as much. 
 Unit economics is sound and it’s possible to stay lean and profitable. After all, market leaders in China reached profitability within three to four years. 
 To reach the top, you need FOMO to kick in. If investors in Southeast Asia are rushing in to invest in powerbank-sharing startups, it will help educate the market. But it will also give rise to a lot of competitors. 
 To get started, you’ll likely need to focus in a dense city and flood it with your powerbank charging stations. One common user frustration is not having enough stations that allow them to borrow and return power banks conveniently. 
 To survive, you need to stay lean and aim to be acquired by a larger player or strategic partner. Jumei, one of China’s leading online retailer of beauty products, acquired Jiedian Technology in August 2017. 
 If you are good at fundraising, then that could be the path for you. But even if you can kill the competition with capital, you still need healthy unit economics. Otherwise, you’ll look stupid when compared to your China counterparts. 
 A gentle reminder that the first is not necessarily the best. Monster Energy, which has raised the lion’s share of funding, was only founded in May 2017. Monster Energy, Jiedian, and Xiaodian have about the same market share, collectively taking up over 80% of the pie. 
 
    
 As an investor, pay attention to the following: 
 
 Exit opportunities are available through one of the Chinese companies, strategic partners, or super apps. 
 You’re better off finding founders who have a vision for the region but are willing to meticulously execute in dense cities with people addicted to their phones. 
 Check out our list of powerbank-sharing startups in this piece – the earliest was founded in 2017. 
 You probably want to find and bankroll the “Xiaodian of Southeast Asia” – a startup that’s not too early into the game and has great capital efficiency. If we weren’t in the middle of a pandemic, perhaps now would be the right time to strike.

651891,Hong Kong’s Animoca Brands raises $4.1m ahead of another IPO," Hong Kong-based  Animoca Brands , an entertainment company specializing in blockchain and gaming, has secured US$4.1 million in strategic investments via convertible notes from investors including M7 Asia and Mind Fund.

 Part of the new funds will be spent to support its new attempt to go public on Euronext or another public exchange by spinning off the assets of its subsidiaries Pixowl, TSB Gaming, nWay, and Quidd, Animoca Brands said in a statement. 
 The company did an initial public offering in Australia in 2014, but it  got delisted  from the Australian Securities Exchange in March this year because of “certain governance items, involvement in cryptocurrency-related activities and substantial use of SAFEs issued by subsidiaries.” 
 “We believe it is in the best interests of the company and of its shareholders for Animoca Brands to be listed on a public exchange, and we are pursuing available options,” Animoca Brands co-founder and chairman Yat Siu told  Tech in Asia , adding that more information will be shared once available. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Now, the company said it has achieved record-high revenue of US$7.3 million in the first four months of this year, with the month of April alone seeing US$3 million in revenue. 
 Its blockchain products demonstrated a strong performance amid the Covid-19 pandemic, thanks to the sales of tokenized game assets, Yat Siu said. 
 Some of the gaming brands in its portfolio include The Sandbox, Crazy Defense Heroes, Formula 1, Marvel, Power Rangers, MotoGP, and Doraemon, among others. 
 In addition, the company’s health and fitness subsidiary OliveX has recently lodged its prospectus for a public listing on the National Stock Exchange of Australia. 
 Launched in 2017, OliveX’s offerings include gamified health and fitness programs and an AI smart fitness mirror called Kara Mirror. Its apps have seen around 2 million downloads. The startup has also achieved US$271,ooo in revenue for the half year ending on June 30, according to its  prospectus . 
 Last year, it raised  US$1 million  in funding from strategic investors including Alabaster and Antanas Guoga. 
  What are its future plans?  Animoca Brands has a couple of major launches coming up later this year, including  The Sandbox  and  F1 Delta Time . Yat Siu said both games represent innovation in the areas of true digital ownership and play-to-earn, a model adopted by blockchain games to create digital collectibles with real-world value. 
 There are also upcoming new products from its subsidiaries, including casual games by Gamee and some hardcore games from nWay. 
  What is its funding history?  In 2011, the company raised an undisclosed amount of  series A round  led by Intel Capital and IDG-Accel. It was followed by a strategic investment from Chinese game development firm Forgame Holdings in 2013. 
 After going public, it raised more than US$30 million in several post-IPO equity rounds. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.99967384)]","['Quidd', 'nWay', 'AI']","['Asia', 'Gamee', 'Australia']"

 The startup that makes your internet less crappy 
   
Ah, slow internet. Nothing irks me more than having my internet connection get so bad, my pixelated image on Google Meet makes people think I’m using a de-aging filter. 
 Singapore-based Transcelestial is a startup that aims to make our internet connection faster — as well as our online video resolution better — by building a space laser network. 
 It recently  raised US$9.6 million  in a series A funding round co-led by Wavemaker Partners and EDBI. 
  Laser-fast internet with laser  
Founded in 2016, Transcelestial uses a wireless laser communication technology to provide high-speed connectivity. 
 Although the company has a presence in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and South Korea, it is only selectively running closed beta trials with telcos such as SK Telecom, one of South Korea’s largest mobile carriers. 
 Finding a telco to work with would be quite a feat for the startup, as telcos are known to be traditionally slow-moving when it comes to adopting new technology. 
 According to the founder, the introduction of Transcelestial’s technology has coincided with the rise of 5G, which pushes telcos to try out innovations in the space.

651908,TikTok reportedly mulls corporate changes amid growing security concerns," Chinese internet major ByteDance is considering changing up the corporate structure of TikTok as the app remains under scrutiny in the US and India over security concerns.

 The company’s executives are now weighing some options, including forming a new management board for TikTok and establishing a separate headquarters for the app outside of China, the  Wall Street Journal  reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
 A spokesperson for TikTok told  Tech in Asia  that the company is indeed mulling shaking up its corporate structure, but kept specific details undisclosed. 
 “We will move forward in the best interest of our users, employees, artists, creators, partners, and policymakers,” the spokesperson added. 
 TikTok, which currently doesn’t have its own headquarters, is also said to be considering several locations for its global offices. According to the report, its five largest offices are in New York, London, Dublin, Singapore, and Los Angeles, where its CEO Kevin Mayer is based in. 
 TikTok welcomed Mayer in May after he had led the streaming business of US entertainment behemoth Disney. At TikTok, he’s tasked with spearheading the short-video app’s global push. 
 The app has seen a surge in downloads as millions of mobile users stay at home due to the pandemic. According to Sensor Tower, the app was downloaded a total of 2 billion times as of April; roughly 315 million of these downloads came during the first quarter of this year. 
 This growth, however, has put TikTok in security regulators’ crosshairs. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently said that the government is looking to block the app in the country amid mounting concerns that China can use it to spy on and spread propaganda among its users. 
 TikTok is also one of the 59 apps that were recently banned in India. The Indian government claimed that the apps have been “stealing and then surreptitiously transmitting” user data to locations outside of the country. 
 In defense, TikTok reiterated that it doesn’t store any user information in China. The company also assured that it will refuse any request by the Chinese government to censor content or to access its user data, should such situations arise. 
 Most recently, ByteDance said TikTok will be  exiting the Hong Kong market  after the region adopted a new national security law that grants expanded powers to the government of mainland China.

651837,SoftBank-backed ecommerce major Coupang said to buy Hooq’s assets," Coupang, a major ecommerce player based   in South Korea, is reportedly buying the software of Hooq, the Singtel-backed video-streaming service that  filed for liquidition  in March. 
 Coupang had already worked out a deal to buy Hooq’s assets, according to a report by  Bloomberg  that cited people familiar with the matter.

 Jointly founded by Singtel, Sony Pictures, and Warner Bros., Hooq provided over-the-top video services in Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, and India. Earlier this year, it was reported that Hooq was filing for liquidation after failing to demonstrate sufficient growth and provide sustainable returns. 
 Coupang, on the other hand, is dubbed as South Korea’s Amazon. It’s backed by big-name investors such as SoftBank, Sequoia Capital, and BlackRock. 
 In 2018, Coupang launched its food delivery service Rocket Fresh, with over  160 delivery bases  across the country. It also introduced its own digital payment system, OneTouch Payment, which allows its customers to check out with a single touch on their mobile devices. 
 As of the end of 2019, Coupang achieved more than  US$10 billion  in gross merchandise value. It currently delivers  3.3 million  items each day, up from an average of 2.2 million last year. 
 With a valuation of US$9 billion, Coupang is said to be seeking an initial public offering as soon as next year. But in the meantime, it seems keen to join the rising competition among video-streaming players in Asia. 
 The latest news about Coupang comes shortly after Chinese tech giant  Tencent purchased Malaysia-based streaming service Iflix  as it seeks to expand its own on-demand video service WeTV across Southeast Asia. US giant Netflix is still the dominant player in the region in terms of average weekly watch minutes.

651803,Zilingo cuts 12% of jobs – here’s what happened behind the scenes," Zilingo, the Singapore-headquartered business-to-business fashion ecommerce company with close to US$1 billion in valuation, has cut more jobs in Singapore, Thailand, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia as it deals with the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, several sources close to the situation tell  Tech in Asia . 
 Founders Ankiti Bose and Dhruv Kapoor said in a  blog post  that 12% of the company’s total workforce has been affected.

 This follows the  first round of layoffs  in April, which affected about 5% of its then-900-strong workforce, though sources indicate that the retrenchments went even deeper. 
 The company is also instituting pay cuts and remote working measures as well as shifting some Singapore-based roles abroad. This may mean letting go of or subletting its current spaces. Its entire office at Singapore’s Duo Tower, for instance, was advertised on the property site CommercialGuru, a person involved in the sale tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Zilingo, however, said on its blog post that its “current Singapore office” will be fully functional by August. The listing has since been taken down, but it was up for a few days at least. 
 Meanwhile, Zilingo’s chief financial officer  James Perry  – a well-regarded investment banker who worked at Citibank for 22 years before joining the startup – has returned his shares to the company for a token sum, public filings reveal. He had been with Zilingo for just over a year. 
 However, a spokesperson states that Perry is still with the company. The filing “reflects an internal restructure of shares to be in compliance with applicable regulations,” she said. 
 Effects of Covid-19 
 In the company blog post, Bose and Kapoor mention that for most fashion-focused small and medium-sized enterprises across Asia – Zilingo’s core market – recovery is expected to be slow and will likely take another three to six months. They also say that over 25% of fashion MSMEs in South and Southeast Asia have shut down. 
 In addition, one employee tells  Tech in Asia  that Covid-19 has disrupted the company’s fintech plans, as many SMEs are expected to default. 
 Zilingo’s role has been to facilitate loans to SMEs in partnership with a financial institution. Through brokerage fees, this business was supposed to be a profit-generating machine, an ex-employee says. 
 But the entire online lending space has been hit by the pandemic, with layoffs at major lenders such as  Akulaku ,  Oriente , and  Funding Societies .

 The exact scale of Covid-19’s impact on Zilingo is unclear, but a concerned chief executive at one of Zilingo’s vendors tells  Tech in Asia  that he has decided to cut the company’s credit line. 
 Zilingo’s founders, meanwhile, are claiming that “various initiatives” in Q2 2020 have allowed the company to “significantly” improve profitability and focus on specific areas of the business. 
 It has also expanded into new categories, such as  personal protective equipment (PPE)  and – in a departure from its fashion focus –  fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) . On Zilingo Trade, its B2B platform, users can already purchase face masks and face shields, along with cooking oil and instant noodles. 
 While employees recognize the need to find alternative income sources to help the company survive the pandemic, they also question this strategy. 
 “PPE is definitely something that everyone is chasing, but I don’t think there are margins to make there,” says a current employee. “It’s not going to move the needle.” 
 A former employee questions what Zilingo’s value proposition is for PPE, as it would not be the first company to consider this particular vertical. The source admits that offering PPE could be a nice strategy – if done “properly,” that is. 
 “You need to be very professional, because you cannot deliver bad products [when] people’s lives are on the line,” the ex-staff says. “You also need time, you need to know suppliers, have contracts, secure logistics and supply chain. It’s not a business you enter in two days.” 
 
  A screenshot of Zilingo Trade’s PPE section 
 
 As for FMCG, an employee in Thailand says that Zilingo will come up against a formidable competitor: the Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group. The homegrown conglomerate operates 7-Eleven convenience stores across the country, among other businesses. The source says that Zilingo’s target has been mom and pop shops, but there are “barely” any of those left in Bangkok. 
 “I don’t think they did the demographic analysis right,” the person explains. “In Bangkok alone, everything is monopolized by CP and 7-Eleven.” 
 The same goes for restaurants, which are starting to reopen in the country. Zilingo would have to go up against CP-owned Makro, Thailand’s biggest food supply distributor. 
 In the meantime, Zilingo’s founders are expecting the global economic recovery to take a year or more. As such, the company is cutting down costs to ensure “long-term profitability.” 
 The leadership team is also taking a 30% pay cut “at the very least,” while others have opted for voluntary pay cuts. 
 “We would like to ensure a majority of our teams remain on full pay,” wrote Bose and Kapoor. 
 The challenges of B2B ecommerce 
 While Covid-19 has surely made an impact on Zilingo’s business, current and former employees tell  Tech in Asia  of problems within the company that have existed even before the pandemic. 
 In the blog post, Bose and Kapoor talked about having a “razor-sharp focus” on two core propositions: enabling B2B commerce and enabling merchants with critical digital services across software, logistics, marketing, and payments. 
 Employees generally agree that the B2B segment is the company’s main revenue driver. A former employee recalls that Aadi Vaidya, Zilingo’s chief operating officer, sent an email to staff sometime in 2019, stating that the company’s gross merchandise value (GMV) amounted to over US$1 billion. 
 Assuming the typical marketplace margin of 10% to 15%, the former employee estimates a turnover of US$100 million, most of it coming primarily from B2B. 
 By February 2020, Zilingo was hitting US$2 billion in annualized GMV, a source close to the company told  Tech in Asia  previously. 
 However, a source who is familiar with the company’s marketing strategy says that unlike the business-to-consumer segment, which generally focuses on promo code-heavy discounts (even for other companies), marketing for B2B revolves around getting sellers to enlist on the Zilingo platform through offline engagement. But the return on investment for their B2B marketing spend is negative, the person says. 
 “In the markets that we operate, we cannot build that trust and brand awareness to encourage a buyer in Indonesia to spend more than US$100 to go online and buy from wholesalers” on the Zilingo platform, the source says. As a B2B brand, Zilingo is not as established as competitors like the Indonesian startup Ralali or the bigger ecommerce marketplaces, the person further notes.

  Tech in Asia  reached out to over 15 clothing merchants on Tokopedia and Lazada in Indonesia and five in Thailand. While most have heard of Zilingo, especially among those in Indonesia, only one merchant has used it. That merchant last communicated with Zilingo in 2018 and didn’t continue on the platform because the transaction fees were substantially higher compared to Tokopedia’s. Zilingo had said in February that it had  70,000 sellers  on its platform. 
 Meanwhile, the CEO of a major competitor says that his firm has not encountered Zilingo in its outreach to “decent-sized” ecommerce sellers in Indonesia. 
 Zilingo had also solidified its foray into the software-as-a-service (SaaS) space with the  acquisition of Sri Lankan startup nCinga  for US$15.5 million at the end of last year. But while Bose and Kapoor talked about software solutions as part of their core propositions moving forward in the blog post, employees say that “most” members of the SaaS team have exited the company. 
 Those that have left include the SaaS team’s head of business and product Sid Narayanan and its product marketing manager Willy Vanneste. Narayanan declined to comment for this story, while Vanneste did not return  Tech in Asia ’s request for comment. 
 Zilingo is currently looking for a sales manager and head of SaaS, who will be both based in its Jakarta office. That said, employees point out that the company hasn’t reached a large customer base for the SaaS product yet. 
  One bright spot for Zilingo appears to be its marketing-as-a-service (MaaS) unit, which lets brands and other businesses hire Zilingo’s in-house team for catalog and video shoots. An employee says the service is seeing a “healthy pipeline” in markets like Indonesia and Thailand.  
  “In Thailand, it’s doing really well because there are a lot of SMEs and small fashion brands,” the person says.  
  However, it’s unclear how much Zilingo’s MaaS contributing to the bottom line or how scalable the service would be compared to other business units. The employee says the four-person Thai MaaS team is “overworked,” handling something like 10,000 stock-keeping units a week.  
 The toll of rapid pivots 
 While drastic changes in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic is understandable, employees say that the move to PPE and FMCG is just the latest in a string of pivots in Zilingo’s history, giving them the impression that the startup has unclear priorities. 
 Having started out primarily as a B2C fashion platform similar to Zalora, Zilingo doubled down on B2B after raising  US$226 million  in series D funding early last year. It proceeded to announce new initiatives in SaaS, MaaS, and fintech. 
 However, the way the pivots were done has taken a toll not just on company performance but also the culture. Decision-making often felt “impulsive,” employees say. 
 “I think that may have worked two years ago, but that kind of business decision-making at this point is not sustainable for team morale or productivity,” says an ex-staff.

 The lack of transparency and communication from the top included disclosure of metrics such as revenue, GMV, or even cash burn and runway, which were “not actively distributed,” reveals one former employee. The staff would know only if they ask the right people or if they were in the right meeting or team. 
 Zilingo would also organize off-site meetings at the last minute for a select number of people (primarily senior staff), without disseminating the minutes or results of those meetings to the rest of the company. 
 “Even finding out about new offices that were opening in Vietnam and Cambodia – by the time the [whole] company would hear it, it had been one or two months [already],” a source says. “A running joke was that you would find out more about the company through the news, rather than as an employee.” 
  See more:   Zilingo’s layoffs expose internal fault lines  
 But a former employee also spoke of a positive time at Zilingo, when the leadership was “approachable” and willing to disclose information when asked. 
 “It’s an individual effort. To be recognized, you need to put in effort, not just in terms of results but also in reaching out” to the leadership, the source says. “Everyone needs to be proactive.” 
 The pivots also had ramifications in the hiring process. An employee says new hires would show up on their first day and then be informed that their scope had expanded or totally changed. 
 “Because of all these constant changes, the attrition rate is very high in the marketing and sales teams,” the person says. “There are people hired to do B2C, and now they’re doing SaaS. It’s very hard to pivot skill sets into a different vertical or role.” 
 An ex-staff adds: “I guess that’s part of the startup nature. But at this time and with their resources, I don’t think that’s a decision that would help them.” 
 Zilingo investors Sequoia Capital India, Temasek Holdings, Wavemaker Partners, and Burda Principal Investments declined to give comment for this story. 
 In the meantime, Bose and Kapoor said that Zilingo’s leadership and human resources team are “driving” outplacement efforts for those affected.

651527,NTU professor’s startup Aromatec scores funding," Many people may not realize this but there’s a complex technology behind the production of their favorite beverage to make sure it’s of top quality. 
 Singapore-based startup  Aromatec  has just raised an undisclosed sum to help improve that tech. 
 The round was led by Sunbo Partners, the Singapore subsidiary of South Korean investment firm Sunbo Angel Partners. A corporate strategic investor that develops and operates wastewater treatment systems also participated in the round. 
 
  From left: Aromatec CEO and chief technology officer Lei Shi, Aromatec co-founder Rong Wang, Sunbo Angel Partners founder and CEO Youngchan Choi, and Sunbo Angel Partners deputy general manager Ming Jin Goh / Photo credit: Sunbo Angel Partners 
 
  What problem is it solving?  Founded in 2018, Aromatec manufactures hollow-fiber membranes for the concentration of liquid products in industries such as beverage, wastewater treatment, flavor, and fragrance. 
 Manufacturers typically use thermal evaporation – which involves generating a vacuum and heating the beverage – to make drinks concentrated. However, this method requires huge capital and operating expenses. Applying heat also alters the taste and aroma of the end product. 
 Forward osmosis is an alternative to thermal evaporation. It’s a natural process that doesn’t require external heat or pressure and too much energy. It also doesn’t alter the taste and aroma of the end product. 
 “We pivoted FO [forward osmosis] technology from water reclamation to concentration application because we believe that there is a more essential need for this technology and solution to enhance existing concentration processes,” Aromatec said. 
 Current solutions in the market include flat-sheet membranes. However, these may have issues with how water flows through the membranes and are quite difficult to use due to intensive pre-treatment and maintenance, the company observed. 
 After 10 years of doing research and snapping up fresh capital, Aromatec’s Rong Wang and Lei Shi are ready to commercialize their hollow-fiber membranes specially designed for forward osmosis – a first in the world, they claim. 
 By adopting Aromatec’s technology, customers may save on energy as well as transportation and storage costs due to the lower volume of concentrates, the company told  Tech in Asia . It can also customize equipment and systems based on the customer’s needs. 
 Aromatec, however, is aware that adoption may take time due to the high capital expense for adopting a new manufacturing and production system. It’ll also require several tests before a manufacturer could fully adopt a new technology. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  The company estimates the forward osmosis market to be worth US$6 billion in 2017. Meanwhile, the hollow-fiber membrane market could have been worth US$5.4 billion in 2019. Aromatec said it currently has several corporations testing its technology. 
 One is a European flavor and fragrance company that has ordered a pilot system and additional membrane modules. It also intends to deploy a full-scale industrial manufacturing system in the near future. Another corporation has also ordered several membrane modules for testing. 
 There were also several universities and research organizations that have expressed their interest in ordering smaller systems for research on forward osmosis. 
  Who are the team members?  Wang was the Chair of Nanyang Technological University’s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (July 2014 to June 2020), and is the director of the Singapore Membrane Technology Centre. She holds more than 20 patents for novel membrane fabrication. 
 Meanwhile, Aromatec’s CEO and chief technology officer Shi has 10 years of experience in hollow-fiber membrane development. 
 The company said it’s looking to hire a marketing manager and a junior engineer to help with more projects. ",Doris Yu,0,3,"[(0, 0.020157859), (1, 0.46520084), (3, 0.5145754)]","['Aromatec', 'FO']","['Asia', 'Singapore']"

 Hello readers, 
 Oyo has furloughed staff once more – 400 employees from its Indonesia office. 
 While this isn’t the first time, what’s interesting is that the startup has also made a mini pivot in  its business model  (🔒) which has seen pushback from its partners. 👀

 Hotel chain startup does a mini pivot 
    
 Over $2.5B raised but it isn’t enough. 
 Being a founder of any startup during this pandemic is tough – not unless you’re the CEO of Zoom. But if you’re in the travel or hospitality industry, that’s a whole new ballgame. For Oyo and its partners, for instance, the going ain’t easy.. 
  Let’s look at the numbers  
The pandemic has hit the hotel chain hard. 
 
 In April, Oyo’s occupancy rate in Indonesia fell under 20%, a far cry from its typical rate of 50% to 70%. 
 Now, the occupancy rate has improved to around 40% — still a dip compared to what it used to get. 
 
 But it’s not just Oyo. Hotels across Indonesia have all taken a hit. Out of a total of over 3,500 hotels in the archipelago, close to 1,300 have shut down — affecting 150,000 workers. 
  So is Oyo in a better place  since it has yet to shut down or conduct a layoff in Indonesia? 
 We’re not sure. But we do know this: There have been a few frustrations from Oyo’s employees and the hotel partners it works with. We spoke with them for today’s premium article.

 This startup makes software testing as easy as ABC 
 
  Credit: UXMagazine 
 
 Have you ever opened an app and deleted it in less than 10 seconds because the UX was crap? 
 Singapore-based startup UIlicious is trying to solve that by building an  automated UI testing solution  that is so easy to use, businesses will not  not  use it. 
  UI testing made easy  
Launched in 2016, the founders of UIlicious saw that software teams worldwide were either testing their user interfaces manually or leaving it to the users to report issues to them. 
 So the startup designed a software that’s easy to learn. It doesn’t even require users to have coding know-how – they just have to write their tests in pseudo-English. 
 UIlicious claims its software can cut down weeks of testing to less than an hour. 
 After two years since going to market, the startup is currently net profitable and is now expanding its team and its infrastructure “to grow the business sustainably.”

 Kuaidian, which was founded in 2017, features a highly interactive online community with novel readers and authors. Unlike traditional online novel platforms, users of the Kuaidian app can read pieces line by line, then click the phone screen for a new line to emerge – like checking a new message from a friend in an online chat – and leave comments, if they want. 
 In addition, users can also create their own novels or co-write with others, as well as play a role in a story and post the videos. The company has also rolled out visual dramas based on novels from the platform, one episode of which lasts for about one to five minutes. 
 Kuaidian, which has gained 5 million daily active users, will use the new funds to build its content ecosystem, improve its platform functions, and attract talent, according to GGV.

 Hello readers, 
 News broke last week that Vietnam police had summoned the founder of luxury e-tailer Leflair after suppliers complained of the startup’s failure to pay for US$280k worth of goods. We did a deep dive to find out  what happened  (🔒). 
  Your quick bytes for today:  
 🚶‍♂️  TikTok is exiting Hong Kong  after the country adopted a new national security law. Tech giants Google, Facebook, and Twitter have already  stopped processing requests  for user data from the Hong Kong government. 
 🍎 Similarly, Apple is also currently  “assessing”  the new Hong Kong security law. 
 🎥 Netflix, meanwhile, is probably partying because it’s finally  unblocked in Indonesia  after four long years of negotiations with the country’s Telkom Group. 
 🚫 The U.S. is looking at banning  Chinese social media apps , including TikTok. 
 💸 Digital tax is due this week, but U.S. technology giants in India are saying nope to  making payment . 
 💴 It’s no longer just India: Indonesia is also  imposing a 10% VAT  on sales by Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, and Google. 
 The startup that went from eight digits in revenue to bankruptcy 
   
If you were a founder, what could be the worst way to close down your startup? Probably having the police knocking on your door. 
 Add to that some bad press: how the authorities didn’t find you in your home, complaints from customers about not receiving refunds, and employees voicing out about not getting paid. 
 That’s basically the tale of Vietnam-based ecommerce startup Leflair, which went from 100% year-on-year growth to  bankruptcy after five years of operations  (🔒). 
  What happened?  
Things hadn’t always been this bad for Leflair. Just last year, it was raking in revenues in the early eight digits and even  raised US$7 million  in a series B round. 
 The company was also on track to its US$40 million series C funding. But then WeWorkGate happened in November, and investors started getting cold feet. 
 “We really like Leflair, but if it’s not profitable, it’s going to be very difficult to convince our limited partners. We have to pull out,” some of its existing investors had said. 
 And then, Covid-19 bulldozed its way into everyone’s lives, putting the company in a more vulnerable position. 
 But that’s just the start; the external causes are merely the tip of the iceberg. The founder of Leflair spoke to  Tech in Asia  and revealed other internal missteps he now regrets making.

 The app that lends you friends who can pay your bills for you 
   
Imagine not having a bank account while living in a rural area that doesn’t have a single bank around –  how do you pay your bills? 
 Some of us would think of asking helpful friends with bank accounts to pay for us in the meantime as we pass them cash. 
 Indonesian startup Payfazz is doing exactly that: Helping the unbanked people in rural areas make payments through agents. 
 It recently raised  US$53 million in series B  funding to do so. 
  A friend in need is a friend indeed  
Payfazz’s agents serve as the middleman between financial institutions and the unbanked. 
 An unbanked user gives cash to an agent, who would then buy them prepaid phone credits and pay their electricity bills for them. 
 And this business model seems to be doing well: Just last year, Payfazz processed US$1.2 billion in annual transactions, up from the US$250 million it recorded in 2018. It earns a 1% commission for each transaction completed on the app.

  GoGoX CEO Steven Lam / Photo credit: GoGoX 
 
 GoGoX started off in 2013 as an on-demand van services provider for individuals and businesses. Then it expanded to offer other logistics services, serving over 2 million customers in Hong Kong. 
 Its GoGoBusiness unit is dedicated to providing logistics services to micro, small, and medium enterprises, as well as ecommerce merchants. Its features support multiple user accounts, bulk ordering, and easy access to GoGoX’s customer service team. 
 GoGoDelivery, meanwhile, caters to individual users who want to send gifts, make urgent purchases, or order fresh groceries. Users can have their orders delivered immediately, within four hours, or on the same day. 
 “The two services will benefit Hong Kong users with agile experiences and provide effective as well as value-added logistics services for businesses to overcome [the current] challenging environment,” GoGoX co-founder and CEO Steven Lam said. 
 Lam also noted that the rebranding will enable GoGoX to further develop in Asia. The company currently has a presence in Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, China, India, and Vietnam, boasting over 8 million registered drivers under its network. 
  See:  GoGoVan’s CEO on $1b merger, Vietnam plans, and concerns for the future   
 GoGoX became Hong Kong’s first unicorn in 2017 after inking a merger deal with 58 Suyun, the freight business unit of Chinese online marketplace 58 Home. It then raised  US$250 million  in its series D round the following year, which it used to move into new markets and expand its offerings.

651498,BeliMobilGue founder raises $2.5m to build a multi-vertical auto marketplace,"  TiinTiin , an Indonesian auction-based marketplace for used vehicles, today announced that it has raised more than US$2.5 million in a seed funding round led by its CEO Rolf Monteiro, Amand Ventures, and PT Luminary Media Nusantara. 
 
  TiinTiin CEO Rolf Monteiro / Photo credit: TiinTiin 
 
 TiinTiin was launched in April as a customer-to-business used car platform that also offers instant financing. It will use the new funds to add more financing options, motorcycle listings, and services to its platform later this year. 
  What problem is it solving?  According to TiinTiin, buyers have limited access to vehicle inventory as well as visibility on the condition of a vehicle. Pricing details are not also transparent. To address these issues, the startup said it pre-assesses its inventory and offers tailored financing options. 
 Sellers, on the other hand, often deal with buyers pulling out of a sale, price negotiations, and the possibility of getting paid with counterfeit money, with the entire sales process taking up to two months before it is completed. 
 TiinTiin’s proprietary tech helps with a 300-point vehicle assessment system, which only takes 30 minutes, the startup said. It also pre-pays for the vehicle, basically managing the entire process for sellers. 
  What makes it different?  TiinTiin’s entering an already crowded used car marketplace in Southeast Asia. There are bigger players, such as Malaysia-based Carsome, which has over US$77 million in total funding and is backed by the likes of Gobi Partners, MUFG Innovation Partners, and Convergence Ventures. 
 Singapore’s Carro, meanwhile, has ambitious plans to be the region’s top auto marketplace. It has some big-name investors such as SoftBank, B Capital Group, and Singtel Innov8 to achieve that. 
 In Indonesia, there’s BeliMobilGue, the startup Monteiro founded in 2017. It raised  US$30 million  from Frontier Car Group and appointed a new CEO last year; the company has since rebranded as OLX Autos. Monteiro and BeliMobilGue parted ways early this year, according to a statement. 
 TiinTiin said most of the existing players in the space are C2B operators, meaning they source vehicles from consumers and sell them to car dealers. The startup, however, only sees this model as its entry point, as it looks to venture into B2B and B2C models later this year. It also wants to take a multi-vertical approach, with a plan to launch a new category for motorcycles in the third quarter. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Since its inception, the company claims it has achieved over US$7 million in annualized gross merchandise volume and more than 1,200 annualized transactions. 
 Looking ahead, TiinTiin wants to enter other Southeast Asian markets by 2021 as it aims to capture at least a 10% market share in the region. 
 For now, the startup is quite optimistic about the used car industry despite Covid-19. Used car sales were up by 106% in May and over 13% year on year as people move away from public transport and new car buyers reconsider their options due to the pandemic, TiinTiin observed. 
  Who are the team members?  The company currently has a core team of 20 to 25 people. 
 Monteiro, a Dutch-Indonesian entrepreneur, leads the team. Aside from previously leading BeliMobilGue as CEO, he also worked at iCar Indonesia, Groupon, and LivingSocial. 
 The rest of TiinTiin’s founding team consists of senior vice president Alexander Alvin, head of marketing Renee van Haaren, and head of contact center Faisal Aswar, all of whom have previously worked at BeliMobilGue.

651469,Singapore’s Transcelestial banks nearly $10m in series A round," Singapore-based  Transcelestial , a startup that’s building a space laser network to deliver high-speed internet connectivity, said it has raised US$9.6 million in a series A funding round co-led by Wavemaker Partners and EDBI. 
 New investors Airbus Ventures, Partech, Tekton Ventures, and Cap Vista – the strategic investment arm of the Defence Science and Technology Agency of Singapore – also participated in the round. Existing backers Entrepreneur First, Seeds Capital, and two angel investors pitched in as well.

  What problem is it solving?  The internet is delivered to connected devices in three fundamental steps. First, undersea cables are used to channel data such as videos and music hosted from one country to another. Once these undersea cables come up to a country or continent, telcos and governments build national fiber grids to carry the data to larger cities and smaller towns. 
 Finally, internet service providers take the data and use a mix of fiber and wireless technologies to transfer it to end users. This is where Transcelestial’s technologies come in. 
 Founded in 2016, Transcelestial beams data over to satellites, which then redirect the data to where they’re needed globally. Its proprietary wireless laser communication technology, which it calls “wireless fiber optics,” combines the speed of fiber optics with the flexibility of radio waves to reduce bottlenecks. 
 Centauri, Transcelestial’s mass-produced network device, uses this type of tech to create a wireless distribution network between buildings, cell towers, street-level poles, and other physical infrastructure. It’s aimed at providing rapidly deployable, affordable, and high-speed last-mile connectivity to speed up the adoption of 4G and 5G globally. 
 According to the company, bottlenecks in the internet delivery architecture may result in massive rollout costs, leading to more than half of the world left unconnected or with poor access. 
  What are its future plans?  The importance of last-mile connectivity to homes and offices has become critical with the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, Transcelestial observed. The startup said that almost every country has seen a 35% to 45% surge in internet usage during this period, putting pressure on existing networks. 
 “Last mile [connectivity] impacts consumers and businesses directly, and around 70% to 80% of our focus will be to work with partners in this industry to help resolve this,” Transcelestial co-founder and CEO Rohit Jha told  Tech in Asia . 
 However, the company believes that the biggest wins can only come from an orbit-based distribution approach to resolve bottlenecks within the first two steps in the internet delivery architecture. 
 To achieve that, the startup said it will develop a constellation of small satellites in low Earth orbit to deliver affordable and high-speed network connectivity. “The key element will be the usage of Transcelestial’s wireless laser communication technology to deliver end-to-end fiber-equivalent speeds as a data backbone,” it added. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  When Transcelestial was just building out its technology, the startup knew it had to find out how to get the telecommunications industry, which has been traditionally slow-moving, to adopt its new wireless laser communication system. 
 According to Jha, the company had to identify telcos that have been early adopters of newer tech in general and work with them. The introduction of Transcelestial’s technology has also coincided with the rise of 5G, which is pushing telcos to try out innovations in the space. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  According to Jha, the purpose of the company’s 2018 seed round was to bankroll the development of its core laser communication technology and create a commercial-ready product. 
 “Towards the end of last year, we were able to achieve all of that […],” said Jha. Since then, the company has been selectively running closed beta trials with telcos in Asia such as SK Telecom, one of South Korea’s largest mobile carriers. 
 According to the chief exec, this has prompted Transcelestial to raise a series A round with one question in mind: “Can we use this tech to improve last-mile connectivity globally?” 
 Currently, the company has a presence in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and South Korea. According to Jha, Transcelestial’s plan is to go deeper into the remaining Asian markets. 
 “With Airbus Ventures situated in Japan and our existing high-level discussions with telcos there, that is another country of interest in the region amongst others,” he said. 
 The company also looks to target global markets with similar internet connectivity issues, such as India, Australia, parts of Europe, North and South America, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. 
  What is the company’s funding history?

651596,"As Oyo Indonesia furloughed 400 staff, some workers and hotels pushed back"," The Covid-19 pandemic has brought down the occupancy rates of budget hotel chain Oyo, forcing it to make sudden moves to stay afloat. 
 In Indonesia, the India-headquartered company reveals that it had put 50% of its 800 employees on “leave with limited benefits” – or a furlough – in May. 
 It has also changed its revenue model with hotel partners and implemented new hygiene measures to boost demand, though some hotel partners have bristled at these moves.

 “In April, (the occupancy rate of our partners was) under 20%. Starting in May, we started to see [an incremental increase],” says Eko Bramantyo, Oyo’s country head for Indonesia. According to him, the occupancy rate in Oyo’s hotel chain right now is around 40% – still far from the typical  50% to 70%  range in the country. 
  See more:   Behind Oyo’s layoffs in Malaysia, which affected hundreds of people  
 Hotels across Indonesia, not just Oyo’s, have been hit hard by the health crisis. Out of a total of over  3,500 hotels  in the archipelago, close to  1,300  have shut down – affecting 150,000 workers. 
 Bramantyo says that the extreme and sudden change has pushed Oyo to adjust its approach. Focusing on expansion and market penetration previously, they’re now battling for survival. 
 “Sudden” furloughs 
 For Oyo, the decision to conduct furloughs was better than doing a mass layoff. “When conditions go back to normal, we still need [these employees],” explains Bramantyo. The move was also in line with the government’s direction for companies to avoid layoffs as much as possible, the company adds. 
 According to Bramantyo, the furloughed employees won’t get their monthly salaries, but they will still get a monthly allowance, mandatory religious holiday allowances, and health insurance. 
 Employees that  Tech in Asia Indonesia  spoke with confirmed this. “I’m still getting 1.5 million rupiahs (US$100) per month. I’m also getting health insurance and keeping office facilities like a laptop,” says one employee. 
 Another staff member, however, criticized the way Oyo’s management announced the decision to them. According to him, Oyo sent an email on April 23 offering two options: resign or accept leave with limited benefits. 
 He says that there was a one-on-one session between employees and their respective heads about the company’s condition, but there wasn’t an open discussion about the leave with limited benefits option. He had hoped that employees would have the chance to negotiate payment terms. 
 “For employees who rejected the resignation option, Oyo will one-sidedly put them on leave with limited benefits and communicate the decision over email,” he says, while furnishing the email he received. 
 No more minimum guarantees 
 Besides the furloughs, Oyo also changed its partnership model with property owners. Previously, the company promised a minimum guarantee (MG) every month to all partners who want to join its property chain. However, Oyo has since changed it to a revenue sharing scheme. 
 According to Bramantyo, the MG scheme can increase the number of Oyo partners significantly, but this puts heavy pressure on the company’s finances. Under the strain of the pandemic, he admits that Oyo now needs to adopt a more sustainable business model. 
 These measures, however, have displeased a number of hotel partners, who have turned to an Instagram account called @oyobikinrugi_ (“Oyo makes us lose” in English) to vent their frustrations. Many customers also aired their complaints to the same account, mostly about the unfinished refund processes. 
 A hotel owner, who changed his  kost  – a monthly room rental business – into a hotel because of Oyo, tells  Tech in Asia Indonesia  that the decision felt sudden and that the lack of notice has been a pattern. In the past, Oyo has changed properties’ room prices and promotion schemes suddenly and sometimes without giving hotel owners notice, he says. 
 “In the agreement, we are partners. But in fact, there are many one-sided decisions that they take. Our choice is only to accept that or stop being partners,” he adds. 
 
  Eko Bramantyo, country head of Oyo Indonesia / Photo credit: Oyo 
 
 Besides that, Oyo has also announced a new health protocol for all of its hotel partners in a bid to assure consumers about the company’s hygiene standards and drive up demand. 
 The hotel owner that  Tech in Asia Indonesia  spoke with believes that the sanitary protocol initiated by Oyo is a good initiative. However, he also said that it could potentially become a burden for partners who are already struggling with low occupancy rates because they would have to pay for the sanitation equipment themselves. 
 “Oyo just helped with marketing via the app. We still have to buy items like thermo guns and hand sanitizers,” he explains, adding that he needed to spend up to 3 million rupiahs (around US$200) to buy the necessary equipment. 
 Regarding those complaints, Oyo’s Bramantyo says that he is still discussing the new partnership model with partners. The country head is aware that there are some partners who don’t agree with the new approach and hopes that both parties can come to an agreement. 
 When it comes to customer refunds, Carlo Ongko, country stock head of Oyo Indonesia, explains that the company is committed to completing refunds as soon as possible, but that it must check the validity of every application. Oyo says it tries to fulfill all applications according to its service-level agreement, which gives the firm up to 45 days to process refunds. 
 In the last three months, Ongko says that he has completed 9,000 out of the 11,000 requests he’s received. 
 A long-term challenge 
 Bramantyo did not reveal Oyo’s targets in terms of occupancy or market share this year, as market conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic are still uncertain. Unpredictable regulatory changes from the government are also making the forecasting process impossible to do correctly, he says. 
 For example, Oyo prepared for an occupancy spike for Idul Fitri in May, according to last year’s trend. However, government decisions to tighten movement restrictions meant the occupancy target couldn’t be reached. 
 With Covid-19 still being a big problem in many countries, Bramantyo doesn’t want to speculate when the pandemic will be over. For now, he believes that Oyo is preparing for a challenge that will last a while. 
 “After doing a ‘consolidation’ inside the company, we’re ready to face difficult times like this until next year,” Bramantyo says.

651221,Former DBS exec’s fintech startup bags $8.3m in seed funding," Australia-based fintech company  PictureWealth Holdings  has raised US$8.3 million in private equity and debt for its late seed funding round. 
 This follows the startup’s US$920,000 seed raise in 2017.

 PictureWealth’s digital services cover financial advisory, licensing, insurance, investments, loans, and superannuation, or the money set aside by employers for their employees’ retirement. 
 The company said part of the new funds had been deployed to acquire financial services companies, with the latest one being Neo Financial Solutions (NFS). NFS provides licensing services to over 80 financial advisors across Australia. 
 The rest of the funds will go toward building the next version of PictureWealth’s platform to better support the digital execution of funds and insurance. 
  What problem is it solving?  “Wealth for me isn’t about selling ETF’s [exchange-traded funds] and pretty pie charts. It’s about dealing with clients’ hopes and fears and for that, we need humane humans,” Neal Cross, the firm’s chairman, told  Tech in Asia . 
 The company helps clients get their financial profile and manage their wealth with the help of an on-demand financial expert who offers financial education and advice. 
 “Many financial advisers have spent their entire lives building a business that is now worth less than expected, or in some cases nothing at all,” said David Pettit, co-founder and group CEO of PictureWealth. 
 The company said that its acquisition of NFS will enable its advisors to operate under license as well as offer compliance management, training, and audits. It will also give them access to PictureWealth’s client management software. 
 The startup hires advisors every week. Anyone who’s an authorized representative of NFS may also become a PictureWealth advisor. 
  What’s the opportunity?  According to the company, the superannuation industry in Australia is valued at US$2 trillion. With US$1.4 billion in funds under advice, the company said it’s on its way to achieve its goal of capturing a 10% market share. 
 Since PictureWealth considers itself as a hybrid platform, it may compete with three types of financial services players: regular advisory businesses, robo-advisors, and licensees. Cross, however, is confident that there are no hybrid platforms that operate like them in Australia and globally. 
 “The future of this industry isn’t 100% digital. We feel it’s a mixture of the old world and the new in a hybrid model,” he said. 
 The company then seeks to grow in multiple ways, but primarily by acquiring businesses and digitally transforming them to reduce cost of operations, increase productivity, and improve client experience. 
 It’s also looking to secure series A funds by the end of this year. In addition, expansion towards Southeast Asia and Hong Kong via partnerships is underway, Cross shared. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Within 21 months of commercial operation, the startup said it has attracted 40,000 clients and achieved US$14 million in annualized revenue, with most of it recurring revenue. It also claims it’s growing at an “exceptional and profitable rate.” 
  Who are the team members?  PictureWealth was built by Pettit, Cross, and Marko Sekez, the startup’s chief technology officer. 
 Pettit has over 10 years of experience in the private wealth sector while Cross previously worked at Microsoft, Mastercard, and DBS Bank. He’s also an  advisory board member  in Southeast Asian fintech player Razer Fintech. Sekez, who has over a decade of experience in tech and business, is also co-founder of and board member at marketing solutions provider Appenture.

651459,A startup’s eye-popping claims," Dear readers, 
 What happens when a new startup says it has reached US$1 billion in gross merchandise value in just 12 months and that it got  all  wholesalers – around 20,000 of them – in a large country to join its platform? 
 Usually, the media would lap it all up and report such claims word for word. But as the tech community demands more, startups and the industry in general should no longer be given a free pass. 
 That’s the approach our Indonesia reporter Aditya Hadi Pratama took with our story on GudangAda, which has claimed fantastic numbers and attracted legitimate investors.

 We spoke to a number of current and ex-employees to find out what’s going on. Aditya even did in-person visits with some wholesalers and retailers in person despite the pandemic to get their thoughts on the startup.  Check out the full story for more . 
 We also delved into the much-touted livestreaming ecommerce trend, which has taken off in China. But how essential is it really to the core online shopping experience? It’s set to become important but in a limited way,  writes Melissa Goh . 
 Next, we looked at a startup idea that’s been derided for a long time: powerbank rentals. Contrary to criticism, it appears to be doing well in China.  In this collaborative effort , the  Tech in Asia  team analyzed the concept’s potential in Southeast Asia and calculated its total addressable market as well as unit economics. 
 Finally, we ended the week by poring through the latest financial data from Singapore-based payments startup 2C2P.  Its numbers for 2019 look fantastic , but like most companies, it’s likely facing turbulence this year. If you liked this format, you can expect us to experiment more with shorter but original reporting. 
 That’s all from me this week. And as usual, if you find our work useful,  do subscribe to us .

651528,Accounting app BukuWarung bags pre-series A funding in Quona-led round,"  BukuWarung , an accounting and credit management app for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), has secured an undisclosed amount of funding in a pre-series A round led by Quona Capital, pushing its total funding to the eight-digit territory.

 Existing backers East Ventures, AC Ventures, Golden Gate Ventures, Tanglin Venture Partners, and Indonesian tobacco mogul Michael Sampoerna also participated in the round. Founders of Snapdeal, who are also investors in digital ledger app Khatabook, also took part. 
 BukuWarung offers a mobile app that helps small merchants keep track of all transactions, including credit, expenses, and sales. The startup claims that merchants receive repayments 3x faster and see increased cash flow due to the app’s automatic payment reminders. 
 “Microbusinesses have always been underserved in Indonesia and have very little access to quality financial services,” BukuWarung co-founder Abhinay Peddisetty observed. 
 The company said that in Indonesia, MSMEs contribute over 60% of the country’s US$1 trillion GDP, yet most of them still rely on pen-and-paper accounting methods for their day-to-day operations. 
  What are its future plans?  BukuWarung said it will use the new funds to make new hires for its tech team, go deeper into its product roadmap, grow its merchant base, and meet early monetization goals in the third quarter of the year. 
 More specifically, the startup looks to launch payments and microlending solutions to further bolster its offerings as well as provide working capital to its partner merchants who need to bounce back from the Covid-19 crisis, BukuWarung co-founder Chinmay Chauhan told  Tech in Asia . 
 In addition, to better achieve its goal of building digital infrastructure for 60 million MSMEs in Indonesia, Peddisetty said BukuWarung will leverage Quona Capital’s deep experience around financial inclusion in emerging markets. Besides BukuWarung, the fintech investor has also backed other microbusinesses-focused outfits such as IndiaMart, Neon in Brazil, and Yoco in Africa. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Since the company’s last funding round in April, it said it was able to grow its merchant base tenfold. Chauhan said that BukuWarung has served over 600,000 merchants, with around 200,000 monthly active users to date. It aims to serve 1 million small business owners in the next two months. 
 BukuWarung said it was also able to grow its team across growth, product, tech, data, and partnership roles. 
 In addition, the startup was selected to take part in Y Combinator’s class of YC S20, which is being conducted remotely due to the pandemic. 
  What is the company’s funding history?

651533,Lessons from the fall of luxury e-tailer Leflair," Angry suppliers have confronted Leflair, alleging that the newly defunct Vietnam-based ecommerce startup owed them around 6.5 billion dong (US$280,000) in unpaid goods. As a result of these claims, the firm’s chief executive, Loïc Gautier, was  summoned by the Ho Chi Minh City police department . 
 Local media reports say the startup founder  wasn’t found in his home  in the city’s swanky District 2 when the police came knocking. But Gautier tells  Tech in Asia  that he isn’t running away and that he has contacted “people close to the matter” to resolve this problem. 
 “I’m not downplaying my responsibility, and it’s my job to face those accusations,” he says. Due to “ visa issues ” related to the Covid-19 pandemic, Gautier is now in Paris, away from his wife and child, who are both in the US.

 Things haven’t always been this contentious. Just last year, Leflair’s prospects were looking more optimistic. The company hit the market hard and fast, offering consumers luxury shopping for less. After debuting in Vietnam in 2015, the startup brought on 2,500 brand partners and expanded its operations to Singapore and the Philippines. 
 Like many startups, Leflair’s survival hinged on acquiring funding on time. Gautier says the startup was on track to securing its US$40 million series C. But despite discussions progressing to “advanced stages,” investors got cold feet. 
 “We didn’t see winds changing directions that quickly until we started speaking with investors during  WeWorkGate  in November,” shares Gautier, referring to the ongoing turmoil at the US co-working startup. 
 He recalls that by December, some of the existing investors started to say, “We really like Leflair, but if it’s not profitable, it’s going to be very difficult to convince our limited partners. We have to pull out.”

 Things just kept going south in 2020 as Covid-19 spread across the globe. Leflair’s existing backers became jittery and fell like dominoes: in January, it was investors in China, then in February, it was those in South Korea. By March, the disease had become a full-blown pandemic and all funding discussions were halted. 
 “We had 15 [existing investors] on the capital table, but all of them had commitments to save their own struggling businesses. And we can’t blame them for this as it was an unpredictable period of time,” shares Gautier. 
 The startup needed “at least US$2 million” from each investor to keep going. But since its backers are smaller seed investors or corporate venture capitalists, “they didn’t have the cash to fulfill the ticket size needed to keep Leflair afloat,” he notes. 
 In late January, Leflair retrenched 25% to 30% of its headcount in Vietnam and the Philippines. The company promised to pay their remaining salary, plus a month’s severance. The layoffs were part of its plans to lay low while it searched for a solution. The US$7 million it had raised from its series B had also ran out. 
 In February, Leflair’s founders had sent out feelers for a corporate buyout. The situation looked promising, as Leflair had garnered significant interest from “bigger ecommerce players in the region” and some private equity firms to support its relaunch. 
 “We were aiming to tweak the business model to be less high growth and high burn,” says Gautier. But all this was thwarted again – this time, by bad press. 
 Local reports said the company  owed suppliers US$2 million  and had less than US$50,000 in the bank. Disgruntled customers  complained about not receiving refunds  while employees voiced out about not getting paid. 
 “This scared away a lot of people who were interested in giving a hand during this time,” says Gautier. “We should’ve managed this negative coverage better, especially the distrust with employees.” 
 Faced with a capital crunch and no lifeline, Leflair had no other choice but to file for bankruptcy in May. “It was disheartening, as our operations were growing by 100% on-year annually since we started out in 2015,” laments Gautier. “We were even making revenues in the early eight digits yearly up till that point.” 
 Raison d’être 
 Leflair operated on a flash-sales model, luring customers to purchase items from high-end brands such as Nike, Adidas, Daniel Wellington, and Michael Kors at up to a 70% discount. 
 The startup marketed itself as an online “outlet store” for brands, allowing them to offload end-of-season or slow-moving inventory into Leflair’s warehouses, helping them “make room” for newer items. In return, suppliers would sell Leflair their products at heavily discounted prices.

 “We sell large volumes of items in a short time and of a narrower assortment as opposed to marketplaces like Lazada, which sell a few items from thousands of different products. Our capacity to negotiate with brands allowed customers to buy more at the best value,” explains Gautier. 
 Leflair’s operating model is tried-and-true. It borrowed the tactic from other startups in China, Europe and the US and adapted it to Southeast Asia. One example is China’s Glamour Sales  or Mei.com, which sells items “in limited batches, with discounts as high as 90%,” according to its website.  Singapore-based Reebonz also stocks leftover goods from luxury brands. 
 These startups saw early success. Glamour Sales clinched investments from  Chinese tech titan Alibaba  in 2015, while Reebonz was a poster child among startups in the Lion City as it did  big fundraises  and  listed on the Nasdaq . 
 Leflair also runs on a consignment model. It’s an arrangement in which a vendor leaves goods in the possession of a third party – Leflair in this case – to sell. The vendor receives a percentage of the revenue from the sale. 
 The goods sold can range from brand-new clothes to secondhand items. For instance, Reebonz specializes in designer handbags while Mei.com even has  luxury yacht packages . 
 “We don’t buy the merchandise upfront,” says Gautier. “We only purchase what we have sold and return what didn’t sell.” 
 For example, when Leflair receives a thousand pairs of shoes from a vendor, it stores the products in its warehouses. Then a team photographs the shoes and markets them before they go live on Leflair’s page. 
 This model ensures that Leflair doesn’t take on excess stock. If 700 pairs are sold after a week-long flash sale, then the retailer returns the remaining 300 pairs to the vendor.

 “Brands could even put that inventory in our warehouse before we launched the sales. That’s how we managed to speed up delivery times,” says Gautier. Its model saw success, reaping the firm a gross margin of 20% while winning over suppliers with its ease of use. 
 “Unlike marketplaces, we didn’t have 10 different levels of fees. We gave them a purchase price and we handled the process, from storage to delivery,” he adds. 
 The consignment model generally favors third-party sellers. Because vendors still own the inventory, they could face losses and  other risks  if their goods don’t sell. 
 In contrast, Reebonz  ran into trouble  because it bought goods from vendors that it couldn’t sell, causing it to be laden with debt. 
 Competition in Vietnam’s ecommerce space has become increasingly intense in recent times. Tiki and Sendo, two of the so-called “Big Four” platforms, reportedly  plan to merge  – a move that’s likely to turn up the heat in the industry. 
 Before this, the country’s ecommerce landscape had seen several instances of companies merging or winding up operations. In 2016, several players including Beyeu, Deca, Lingo, Hotdeal, and Muachung closed down. In late 2019, local conglomerate Vingroup combined its marketplace websites with other units as it shifted to the “new retail” model. South Korea’s Lotte followed suit soon after, shuttering its Vietnam-focused online marketplace to pursue the same strategy. 
 Competition was not what killed us. 
 But Gautier stresses that it wasn’t facing off against market rivals that bankrupted Leflair. 
 “We wouldn’t have been able to grow 100% every year for four consecutive years with such strong competition,” he points out. While Leflair focuses on discounted branded goods, “the Big Four are fighting for the same customers, selling the same products. In their case, the one that wins is the one that can burn more cash [by] giving away incentives.” 
 Another factor that sets Leflair apart from other ecommerce players is the size of its average order value (AOV), which is also known as basket size. Coming in at around US$50, its AOV is the highest among its peers and nearly six times than that of the average Vietnamese ecommerce company, which is  estimated  at around 200,000 dong (US$8.60).

 The US$50 figure is actually large, considering that the average ecommerce revenue per user in Vietnam is still relatively low. Online shoppers in the country  spent an average  of just US$46 a year (or US$3.83 per month) on consumer goods in 2019. 
 Gautier explains that Leflair’s high average is linked to the 30% of its customers who spend an average of US$100 every month on the platform. “Competition was not what killed us. And this competitiveness from the Big Four wouldn’t prevent more niche ecommerce players like us from starting their business in Vietnam,” he adds. 
 So why was Leflair in such a precarious financial situation? Its revenues were in the low eight digits and it definitely didn’t lack funding, as it had consistently closed fundraises year after year. 
 Gautier tells  Tech in Asia  that he had put all his eggs in one basket. He thought Leflair had to spend and rev up its expansion engines so it could land the US$40 million round it was targeting.

 “Besides hiring 50 people in the Philippines, we upgraded our operations and fulfillment capabilities in Vietnam and Singapore to prepare to make US$50 million to US$100 million in revenues,” he says. “It was a necessary investment that we made, and its purpose was to grow even more aggressively so we could raise a bigger round later.” 
 Like  similar startups , it didn’t matter that Leflair was bleeding money to expand, as long as it was working towards dominating its market. 
 As such, Leflair wasn’t the only startup to enter 2020 in a low cash position. According to a recent survey, 29% of startups globally started the year with just months of runway left, with Covid-19 putting even more of them  in a vulnerable position . 
 Missteps and regrets 
 Apart from media scrutiny, Leflair has received its fair share of flak from former staff for allegedly spending beyond its means. 
 “We all saw it coming. The office rental was too much, [and] so were staff salaries. All these should’ve been lowered. Leflair was paying much higher than market averages,” says an ex-employee who spoke to  Tech in Asia  on condition of anonymity.

 Responding to these claims, Gautier says he wouldn’t have done things differently at all. 
 “This was all necessary, as we needed to keep competitive with other startups in the region, such as Grab, Sendo, Deliveroo, and Lazada, in securing top talent,” he says. “We reward well as it’s a tough job. We can’t make employees pull 12-hour work days if we don’t pay them well.” 
 Several other ex-employees supported this view, noting that working at Leflair gave them a certain panache. Not only did they feel they were well-compensated, a few remarked even that it was “the best working atmosphere.” 
 Leflair’s dilemma  is not uncommon to startups , which find themselves in a bidding war for talent with well-financed unicorns. That said, some could argue that fledgling businesses like Leflair should seek talent who prefer making an impact at an early-stage company rather than collecting a hefty paycheck at a big firm.

 Another ex-staff member places the blame on expensive operations for Leflair’s quick cash burn, saying a startup “shouldn’t be spending so much money on services like DHL to do deliveries.” The person goes on to point out that a decision to commission an Australian company instead of a local one to build Leflair’s mobile app was costly. 
 However, Gautier says the Australian appmaker “was the clear choice” for Leflair. “We presented ourselves as a premium product, so we had to provide the best.” 
 Using Facebook and Google is like using hard drugs 
 But the CEO does admit he could have done one thing differently. He would have reduced Leflair’s “heavy” reliance on Facebook and Google for its marketing needs and focused on balancing the speed of growth and cost. 
 “Building a brand takes years, not weeks. The faster you want to grow, the more expensive it is,” Gautier observes “Here’s my piece of advice to startups: Find out how to avoid working with Facebook and Google – they aren’t that magical of a tool.” 
 Startups like Leflair that raise venture capital money face pressure to grow.As a result they may spend a lot on unsustainable marketing efforts. 
 Instead, Gautier suggests another approach. “It’s much better to have to go through a tough board meeting, where your investors may doubt of your ability to grow the business fast enough for their liking or to get press coverage that questions the value of what you’re working on, rather than having to let dozens – hundreds in our case – of people go and then go back to the beginning.” 
 He also likened using Facebook and Google to taking “hard drugs.” As Gautier puts it, “It delivers a huge hit – a quick 60% increase – but it comes at a very high cost. And you become very dependent on it.”

 The company was working on ways to reduce marketing costs through technology. Gautier didn’t go into detail about what the team was working on, but two ex-employees said the main problem that Leflair was looking to solve was how to drive more traffic directly to its site. 
 Right now, ecommerce sites rely heavily on organic traffic to drive sales. With Facebook  hiking up advertising costs  by 90% compared to 2018 rates, startups are  seeking alternative ways  to grow their sales. 
 Startups should strike a balance between spending for digital ads and spending to build its brand and identity because “only the latter can save you” when things change,” Gautier advises. 
 “When you have a dependence on paid ads to acquire new customers and get the existing ones to come back, you risk losing it all in a couple of months. [Paid ads] are effective, but are terribly unsustainable if you can’t raise millions of dollars yearly.” 
 Next moves 
 Gautier tells  Tech in Asia  that Leflair still owes its staff the severance it promised, although it’s already paid them their salaries in full. The firm also says it’s still working on paying off its US$2 million debt to former suppliers. 
 
  Caption: Leflair’s goodbye message on its website 
 
 Gautier also regrets that many shoppers will have “no choice” but to be disappointed if they’re hoping to exchange their items. “We can’t do exchanges as the business doesn’t exist anymore. So we’ll work on refunding them instead,” he says. 
 Gautier didn’t expect to go from expansion to bankruptcy in a span of five months, but he says the Leflair team has learned “a valuable lesson” from it. He and Brun also won’t be starting another company anytime soon. Instead, they’ll focus on helping other ecommerce firms by doing consulting work. 
 “We’re entrepreneurs – we will keep building companies together. We just learned a big lesson in financial independence, [so] we need to focus on being able to finance our companies ourselves first,” Gautier concludes.

649193,This startup makes software testing easy even for non-programmers," People delete apps for  several reasons , but many of them have something do with how easy or difficult the user experience is. Shi Ling Tai, co-founder of Singapore-based startup  UIlicious , says that demand for user-friendly apps and websites has spiked as people increasingly rely on digital services. 
 However, there aren’t enough good software engineers to meet this demand. As a result, testing software to ensure they work perfectly has become a daunting task for developers and businesses.

 “As the number of features on software grows, it is impossible to test everything and catch software bugs by hand on the plethora of browsers and devices people today are using,” Tai explains. She also observes that most software teams worldwide either test their user interface (UI) manually or leave it to users to report issues to them. 
 These problems led Tai and her co-founder Eugene Cheah to build an automated UI testing solution that’s very easy to use yet also robust. 
 UI testing made easy 
 Prior to establishing UIlicious in 2016, Tai had worked at several local B2B software-as-a-service startups as a web developer. She was a full-stack web app developer at Singapore-based marketing solutions provider Knorex right before co-founding the startup. 
 Cheah, on the other hand, previously worked at a software development house, building several enterprise web and mobile apps for financial institutes. Prior to UIlicious, he was a director for the app and software development firm Picoded. 
 The two co-founders consider UI testing a billion-dollar opportunity. 
 “Ninety percent of software teams are still testing their applications manually with in-house or outsourced testers simply because they don’t have the know-how to automate UI testing,” Tai says. “Up to half of the cost of software development is spent on testing or fixing defects that have already impacted users.” 
 UIlicious is not the first automated UI testing solution in the market. Tai and Cheah had tried using various free and paid solutions in the past but encountered several issues. Tai shares that for some of those existing platforms, even minor layout changes can cause a number of unrelated properties to fail the test. 
 Based on this experience, the startup designed a low-maintenance software that’s easy to learn. It doesn’t even require users to have coding know-how, thus allowing anyone to write tests in pseudo-English. 
 
  UIlicious’ tech understands the structure of websites based on the use of semantic HTML and ARIA accessibility attributes, as well as the context of the previous commands. / Image credit: UIlicious 
 
 UIlicious claims its software can save teams time as they set up their testing grid, write first test scripts, and set up continuous test monitoring, cutting down weeks to less than an hour. 
 This has helped the company stand out in the market, which already has early players Tricentis Tosca, BrowserStack, and SauceLabs. While all of them offer more or less the same service as UIlicious does, they work best in software development and IT environments. 
  Profitability and sustainability  
 UIlicious offers its solutions on a subscription basis, presenting different plans depending on the kinds and numbers of tests to be performed. 
 For example, if a client is only looking to test their software on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, subscription starts at US$120 per month for two parallel tests. To test the full range on Chrome, Firefox, Apple’s Safari, and Microsoft’s Edge and Internet Explorer, the cost starts at US$760 per month for four parallel tests. 
 UIlicious also offers a free tier, which allows anyone to write a test for any website and run a demo desktop version for up to three minutes. 
 The startup declines to disclose the current number of its clients as well as its targets, but says its core focus right now continues to be customer and revenue growth. 
 After two years since going to market, Tai shares the startup is currently net profitable and is now expanding its team and its infrastructure “to grow the business sustainably.” 
 With its profitability, UIlicious says it has no immediate plans to raise additional capital. Its last fundraise was in 2017 when it secured US$500,000 from angel investors. It was also part of Entreprenur First’s inaugural Singapore cohort in 2017.

651490,"TikTok to exit Hong Kong, report says"," ByteDance’s short-video app TikTok will pull out of Hong Kong within a few days, after several tech companies such as Google and Facebook have suspended processing government requests for user data from the region. 
 ByteDance’s decision comes as Hong Kong adopts a new national security law that grants expanded powers to the mainland Chinese government. According to industry observers, the recent law would let mainland China request for user data from global companies with operations in the special administrative region. 
 “In light of recent events, we’ve decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,” a spokesperson told  Reuters.   
 
  Photo credit: Alexey Malkin/123RF 
 
 A source familiar with the matter told  Reuters  that Hong Kong is a small and loss-making market for TikTok, which serves about 150,000 users in the city. Globally, the app has amassed a total of  2 billion  downloads as of April this year. 
 ByteDance had said before that TikTok, now  led by Disney’s former head of streaming Kevin Mayer , never shares data with the Chinese government. 
 TikTok is also one of the 59 apps that have been banned in India recently. According to the local government, the apps have been “stealing and then surreptitiously transmitting” data to locations outside of the country. ByteDance is expecting to see US$6 billion in losses as a result of the ban, according to reports. 
 The US is also looking to block the app in the country amid concerns that TikTok can be used by China to spread propaganda and as a surveillance tool. 
 In its defense, TikTok reiterated that it doesn’t store user data in China and that it rejects any requests made by the Chinese government to censor content or to access TikTok’s user data. 
 The app is also designed so it won’t be accessible by mainland China, where ByteDance operates Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. A spokesperson for ByteDance told  Reuters  that although there are no plans to formally bring Douyin to Hong Kong for now, it already has a sizeable audience in the region.

 “The combined GDP of India and Southeast Asia is expected to cross US$14 trillion, and the number of mobile internet users will likely cross 1.5 billion by 2030. This region will become home to a number of massive technology companies during the next decade,” Shailendra J Singh, managing director at Sequoia Capital, said in a  blog post . 
 The development comes as businesses globally deal with the negative economic effects of Covid-19. Earlier this year, the VC firm dubbed the pandemic “ the black swan of 2020, ” urging its portfolio companies to brace for turbulence. 
 However, Sequoia believes the pandemic has “catalyzed a massive change” and “a new bull cycle for tech startups could soon be on its way.” 
 “Costs have been trimmed, product roadmaps have been prioritized, new revenue levers have been unlocked, and wonderful new talent has been hired. The leadership teams inside our startups are more aligned, focused, and determined than ever before,” Singh wrote. 
 He also emphasized the need for profitable startups that can compete globally on quality, pursue original ideas, and demonstrate authentic leadership. 
 Sequoia has invested across the region for over 14 years. In 2018, it closed its sixth fund at US$685 million, making over 200 investments at the time. 
 Its portfolio companies include ride-hailing giant Gojek, ecommerce platform Tokopedia, online travel company Traveloka, sports media firm One Championship, hospitality firm Oyo, and edtech startup Byju’s, among others. 
 The company also runs a scale-up program called Surge to provide further support for early-stage startups in India and Southeast Asia. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(0, 0.99954516)]","['Gojek', 'Tokopedia', 'Oyo']","['VC', 'India']"

651325,Former Grab execs’ AI startup nets $7m in series A money,"  NextBillion , a Singapore-based startup focused on providing AI mapping solutions to enterprises, has closed US$7 million in a series A funding round co-led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Falcon Edge Capital. 
 NextBillion is also backed by angel investors such as Cassandra founder Prashant Malik and Mad Street Den founders Anand Chandrasekeran and Ashwini Asokan, as well as Nishant Rao, ex-chief operating officer at Freshworks.

 According to a statement, the startup will use the fresh capital to expand its team and invest in research and development for new focus areas such as facial recognition, natural language processing, and cybersecurity. 
  What problem is it solving?  By combining people, tech, and software, NextBillion said it aims to build multiple use cases for enterprises to help them expand in emerging and developed markets. It’s also focused on providing businesses with hyperlocal solutions. 
 “Emerging markets across the world are far more complex – with different languages, cultures, hyperlocal nuances, and densely populated cities – than the developed markets,” said Gaurav Bubna, co-founder of NextBillion. 
 Its first product NextBillion Maps is a software-as-a-service platform that provides application programming interfaces for routing, navigation, direction, and distance matrix. The startup looks to offer new AI tools that support map data curation and maintenance soon. 
 It’s currently developing its second product NextBillion Tasks, which uses AI for multilingual texts, image classification, sentiment analysis, and video annotations. 
 With the AI space already dominated by more familiar names such as China’s SenseTime, NextBillion said it can partner with incumbent players that wish to go global by providing services like facial recognition data collection and annotation. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  The company, which was established just this year, said it already has a couple of paying customers and over 20 pilots globally. It has also onboarded global companies in social, ride-hailing, food delivery, and logistics sectors, seeing growth in markets such as Singapore, the US, Europe, Indonesia, China, and India. 
  Who are the team members?  NextBillion was built by co-founders Gaurav Bubna, Ajay Bulusu, and Shaolin Zheng, who were previously part of ride-hailing giant Grab’s tech leadership team. They helped develop features like routing, pricing, and estimated time of arrival for Grab Maps. 
 The rest of the NextBillion team, meanwhile, consist of software engineers from Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance.

651439,Can this fintech startup stay profitable?,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Hello readers, 
 Have you heard TikTok’s new viral song? It’s called “ F**k 2020 ” and captures the essence of this year pretty well for businesses and startups. One company that’s fighting back is 2C2P, which became profitable in 2019. That said, is it on track to stay in the black this year? We look into the numbers in more detail below. 
  Your quick bytes for today:  
 🚗 Grab Indonesia and its partner were fined over US$3 million for  showing favoritism . 
 💰 Intel has joined Jio Platforms’ long line of suitors,  investing US$253 million  in the digital services firm. 
 📚 ByteDance is going up against Tencent in the battle for online literature, as the TikTok owner took  around a 10% stake  in Dingtian Culture, which runs multiple online reading platforms. 
 🍔 The tension between India and China isn’t just affecting the Chinese apps that India has banned. Indian food delivery startup Zomato, for instance, is having problems  accessing US$100 million  of its funding from Ant Financial. 
 🤝 Indian payment gateway BillDesk is looking for buyers who want to purchase its entire business  for US$2.5 billion . 
 This fintech company had the best year ever 
    
 2019 was an awesome year for payments platform 2C2P. 
 Last year, the company became profitable, generating  US$81.3 million in revenue  (🔒), up 57.5% from the year prior. 
  What’s the secret?  
Remember the good old times when you were able to just buy an airplane ticket on AirAsia’s website? You were likely using 2C2P’s payment gateway to pay for it. 
 The platform helps companies process payments through a multitude of options like credit cards, digital wallets, and cash payments. 
 It has landed big-name clients such as: 
 
 Tech giants Facebook and Apple 
 Ecommerce majors Lazada and Zalora 
 Leading travel companies Agoda and Traveloka 
 Airlines like Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways 
 
 According to an article we published last December, online travel companies and regional airlines are  some of the biggest contributors (🔒) to its revenue, making up 90% to 95% of its ecommerce earnings at the time, said 2C2P founder and CEO Aung Kyaw Moe. 
 As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to wipe out business for the travel sector, it’s unclear how 2C2P’s revenue will be affected. With the company being profitable in 2019 and having raised a  massive funding round  before Covid-19 hit, it seems 2C2P should weather this storm pretty smoothly, even if it remains unprofitable this year. 
 You can find more insightful charts and numbers in  today’s visual article  (🔒), including the company’s cash position, profits and losses, total costs and expenses, and more.

 Who says you need to go to a karaoke bar to sing? 
   
The best thing about being confined to your home: You don’t have to feel embarrassed belting out songs. 
 Singapore-based Popsical knows Asians are obsessed with karaoke, so it created a compact karaoke device that allows people to sing anywhere. 
 Recently, the startup raised  US$5 million in a series A  round led by Quest Ventures. 
  A ‘Spotify for karaoke’?  
Founded in 2016, Popsical wants to reinvent the karaoke system, which it thinks is outdated in terms of both hardware and user experience.. 
 So it created a “karaoke PlayStation” called Popsical Remix — a palm-sized system that offers a self-updating library of over 200,000 songs in 14 languages. 
 To date, the company has sold close to 20,000 of its systems in Singapore and Malaysia, each costing S$499 (US$358) a piece. 
 To access the songs on the device, users will need to purchase either a 24-hour subscription package at S$4.99 (US$3.58) or a monthly package at S$10.90 (US$7.83). 
 Moving forward, Popsical aims to start expanding in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. 
 The karaoke market is expected to grow by almost 3% every year to become US$5.7 billion by 2024.

651332,"Pakistani bus app Airlift raises $10m, launches grocery delivery service","  Airlift Technologies , a smart mobility startup based in Pakistan, has raised US$10 million in a series A1 round led by US-based Quiet Capital. 
 New investors TrueSight Ventures, RT Ventures, Shorooq Partners, and ACE Capital also joined the round alongside existing backers First Round Capital, Fatima Gobi Ventures, and Indus Valley Capital.

 The startup also announced the launch of Airlift Grocer, an offshoot of its core transit operations platform that lets users order groceries and other household essentials through its app. 
 Airlift started off last year as a marketplace for bus owners to operate their vehicles on fixed routes in a stop-to-stop solution. It also provides daily pick-up and drop-off services for its users. 
 However, the startup was forced to put these services on hold earlier this year, with the government of Pakistan implementing strict movement restrictions to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. This has led the startup to try its hand at grocery delivery, which has seen an uptick in activity due to the pandemic, while it waits for the crisis to die down. 
 “Until then, we look forward to serving our communities in new and innovative ways,” the company said. 
 To jumpstart Airlift Grocer, the company said it plans to team up with its investors to build a decentralized logistics platform in the country. The new service is also in line with the government’s income substitution program, creating fresh employment opportunities for riders on its platform. 
 “Airlift understands that the world has changed. Our value to our customers must evolve, our impact on the communities we serve must adapt accordingly,” the company said in a statement. 
   What are its future plans?  Airlift CEO and co-founder Usman Gul told  Tech in Asia  that the company expects to resume operations of its transit business within the next six to nine months, depending on Pakistan’s recovery from Covid-19. 
 With that, Airlift said it aims to invest part of the new funds into its technology to improve and scale the operations of its transit business in the next 12 to 18 months. It also looks to scale its team with the fresh round. 
 “Our plan is to continue to obsess over the customer experience, driving improvements in our operating strategy and technology infrastructure,” Gul said. “We also expect to continue to run experiments to see if our core technology stack can be deployed in other verticals or areas that may be growing quickly during the Covid-19 months.” 
  How much traction has it gotten?  When it last raised funding, the company planned to scale its core mass transit operations. It was also just starting to extend its footprint into other major urban centers in developing markets. 
 “Since then, we have increased ridership by more than 4x and have improved unit profitability by more than 100%,” said Gul. The head exec also shared that Airlift has seen “major improvements” on its growth trajectory and unit profitability, but declined to share further information. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  It’s biggest challenge to date came with the onset of the pandemic in March. During this time, Gul shared that the priority for him and his team was to ensure that new investment partners continued to back the company despite the turbulence in capital markets. 
 “We resolved this by accelerating the path to our next round, prioritizing speed over other factors,” he added. 
 According to the company’s statement, the round marks one of the largest capital investments in the region and sets a new high for the Pakistani startup scene. 
  What is the company’s funding history?  
 
 
 Series A  (2019): US$12 million from lead investor First Round Capital and other undisclosed investors 
 
 Seed  (2019): US$2.2 million from Fatima Ventures and Gobi Partners through their Techxila Fund I and Indus Valley Capital.

651208,Mobile-first HR tech platform Qualee banks $1m in seed funding," Singapore-based HR tech firm  Qualee Technology  said it has secured US$1 million in seed funding from US-based enterprise investor Tandem Technology Partners.

 Founded in 2018, Qualee’s proprietary cloud-based solution, which also uses AI and machine learning, allows companies to more easily engage, onboard, and offboard employees. 
 It plans to use the new funding to expand its team and add new features such as advanced image detection, identity verification, sentiment analysis, and predictive data analytics, Qualee chief operating officer Charley Zuidinga told  Tech in Asia.  
  What problem is it solving?  Currently, companies waste a lot of time and money by sticking to traditional HR tools, Qualee observed. 
 Citing various studies, the firm said that new hire retention can be 50% lower without a structured onboarding process. Many people just entering the workforce also want better orientation procedures, with 49% of millennials expecting smoother onboarding. 
 One study showed that disengaged employees can  cost  companies between US$450 billion and US$550 billion a year. 
  What’s the opportunity?  The global HR management market was valued at  US$16 billion  in 2019, and it’s projected to rise at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7% through 2027. 
 According to a study, the market is expected to maintain “rapid” growth in the following years in Asia Pacific, with HR tools advancing and government support for the digitalization of business processes increasing.

 Qualee shares this space with several other companies such as Singapore-based  StaffAny  and  Swingvy , which both raised funding last year. It also competes with services from Australia’s HROnboard and Enboarder, as well as Japan’s  Laboratik  and  SmartHR . 
 One bigger player is Singapore’s HReasily, a cloud-based  HR automation solution rolled out in 2015. In September last year, a source told  Tech in Asia  that the startup was valued at over  US$100 million  after raising US$5 million in its pre-series A round. 
  How is it different?  Unlike its peers, however, Qualee’s services are mobile-first, allowing its clients to access the platform easily from anywhere. 
 “Qualee was designed from inception to be cloud-powered and native mobile app-engaged. This foundation allows us to scale our offering in multiple value propositions both quickly and cost-effectively,” Zuidinga added. Qualee is available for download on both Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. 
 The startup also claims to be one of the few players in the HR tech market that offers onboarding, engagement, learning, and offboarding solutions in one platform. Some of its features include surveys, micro-learning modules, quizzes, and content libraries for company forms and documents. 
 Qualee offers its product on a subscription basis with different tiers. Its free plan allows for five concurrent mobile app users, while its US$699 plan can support up to 250 users. 
 It’s smaller US$99 Grow and US$299 Premium plans allow for 50 and 100 concurrent users, respectively. The number of customizable employee journeys, quizzes, surveys, and administrators also vary per tier. 
  How much traction is it targeting?  While the company declined to disclose any hard targets for 2020 and beyond, Zuidinga shared that Qualee is looking to extend its reach throughout Asia Pacific. The app currently supports 16 languages, including English, Spanish, Chinese, Thai, Hindi, and Bahasa, among others. 
 According to its website, its clients include blockchain support firm Help Desk, content and media group Indesign Media Asia Pacific, and medical travel information company Global Health and Travel. 
  Who are the team members?  For now, the company is currently looking to strategically grow its team of 13 people. 
 CEO Vipula Samarakoon, who has years of tech and entrepreneurial experience, leads the team. Prior to Qualee, Samarakoon served as managing partner at consultancy firm Cerasia Consultion, a company he helped establish. 
 Samarakoon founded Qualee alongside Zuidinga, who has experience in business development, communications, and the startup ecosystem.

651353,"As remote work rises, HR tech firms spot an opening"," If you live in Singapore, this might be your fourth consecutive month of working from home (WFH) since the Covid-19 pandemic began. 
 Economies across the world may have taken a beating from this unprecedented crisis, but hiring activity in the Asia-Pacific region is now  showing signs of recovery . Workplace norms have also evolved to suit the new normal, leading employers to rethink their human resources strategies.

 “Many employers have realized that having very productive remote work is very possible,” Oswald Yeo, CEO of talent recruitment platform  Glints , tells  Tech in Asia . Many startups, including his, are rushing in to help manage the transition. 
 In the past quarter, Glints has seen an increase in hiring between what it considers “demand markets” for labor like Singapore and Hong Kong, and “supply markets” like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Revenue from the company’s cross-border hiring business in April grew 4x year-on-year. 
 While demand has gone up, so has supply. Searches from candidates in Taiwan looking for work in Singapore have tripled organically since the start of the year, Yeo says. 
 A new normal? 
 Remote hiring can do away with costly relocation packages, which may include travel, accommodation, and family allowances. It also allows employers to tap into each market’s relative strengths: Singapore for its managerial talent, Vietnam and Taiwan for skilled engineers, Indonesia for digital marketing talent, and the Philippines for digital design staff. 
 In Hong Kong, a substantial number of employers that tap Glints’ services are from gaming, ecommerce, and logistics. Of these businesses, 40% are seeking to hire remote engineering teams across Indonesia, Vietnam, and Taiwan.

 The appetite for such services is expected to climb.  CloudStaff , an outsourcing company based in the Philippines, says it’s seen a “sustained and significant” increase in businesses looking to outsource since March. 
 “Professional services such as accounting, finance and collections roles have been proving very popular,” CloudStaff spokesperson Toby Longhurst tells  Tech in Asia . The firm has also been seeing demand from ecommerce, digital marketing, and IT support sectors from markets across the US, Australia, and Hong Kong. 
 Educational technology startups  Geniebook  and  Snapask , which have seen a lift amid a  boom in online learning  as schools across the region suspended classes, are hastening their hiring of overseas talent. 
 At present, Singapore-headquartered Geniebook has a workforce that spans 16 countries. CEO Zhizhong Neo believes that the hiring of talent “should not be limited by international boundaries” and plans to recruit another 150 staff in the next 12 months globally. 
 “Great teachers, engineers and scientists come from around the world, and these are the people we need to help students achieve learning successes,” he says.

 Hong Kong-based Snapask shares this view. How it chooses staff “has very little to do with where the candidate physically is, as long as the skill sets and experience matches our scope and responsibilities,” says founder and CEO Timothy Yu. 
 Even norms among local teams are changing. “In Japan, tech startups as well as large traditional companies such as Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Shiseido have begun to shift to and continue to use remote work as the primary mode of work operation. Such a move was previously unimaginable,” says Toyofumi Miura, CEO of Tokyo-based employee analytics startup  Laboratik . 
 Trade-offs in remote working 
 Despite its advantages, remote working isn’t feasible for all roles. For instance, those in marketing, operations, business development, and research and development may still require people with an understanding of local nuances, compared to those in product and design. 
 It’s also been more productive for some, and less for others. Alia Bei, regional HR manager for Hong Kong-based logistics startup GoGoVan, has seen productivity spikes, but the same can’t be said for all companies. 
 In a workplace sentiment  survey  of over 18,000 respondents in Singapore conducted between April to June, HR analytics firm  EngageRocket  found that while 16% of its respondents found WFH productive, a majority – 40% – thought the opposite.

 Generally, tech firms have seen greater productivity boosts compared to traditional industries, observes EngageRocket co-founder and CEO Chee Tung Leong. Its clients include ecommerce platform Tokopedia and telecommunications firm Starhub. 
 Arrif Ziaudeen, CEO of restaurant reservation startup Chope, said at a   Tech in Asia  live session in June  that his company measures “the velocity of the engineering team” through  user stories , and this increased dramatically while they were working from home. In non-technical roles, however, productivity can be more difficult to measure. 
 Where companies need help 
 The rising trend of remote teams, coupled with the struggles of helping these workers stay productive, has created opportunities for HR-related startups. 
 The two biggest challenges companies face in managing a remote workforce are managing communication and tracking work and productivity, says Katy Stevens, vice president for Asia Pacific at Australia-based employee analytics platform  Culture Amp .

 The Sequoia China-backed startup, which helps clients monitor employee sentiments, counts the Singapore Exchange, Circles Life, and PropertyGuru among its clients in Asia. In the past months, the company has seen more interest from governments, financial services, and utility sectors, which are going through a “rapid transformation.” 
 Even firms used to remote working arrangements may struggle with doing so at scale. Financial marketplace  GoBear  had flexible working policies even before the pandemic, but maintaining engagement and camaraderie among a fully remote team “is by no means an easy task,” says Chanel Lim, GoBear’s chief HR officer. 
 As remote working becomes the norm, some startups are offering  innovative HR solutions , including the remote supervision of jobs involving manual labor, such as cleaning services. Some co-living operators have also refurbished units to accommodate extra desks and office amenities to  incorporate remote working . 
 Here’s a look at more opportunities that HR startups are tackling amid changing norms: 
  1. Remote onboarding tools  
 Companies looking to hire during this period are ”very concerned about having to onboard their new employees remotely, when they might never have done so before,” EngageRocket’s Leong says. “Being able to track sentiment on new hires in the first 30, 60, 90 days, and so on – that’s something that has been of interest.” The company does this monitoring through surveys. 
 Inbound inquiries for EngageRocket’s productivity and engagement tools between April and May alone exceeded what it received for the whole of 2019, which was  a good year  for the startup, Leong notes. 
 Because pulse surveys are brief, they can surface what’s top-of-mind for your employees and help you respond quickly. 
 GoBear is one company that had to remotely onboard 40 new employees, following its  acquisition of AsiaKredit  in May. To keep employees engaged, it maintains an internal wellness page on its site and conducts WFH surveys. 
 Culture Amp has similarly launched a remote onboard survey amid the pandemic to better understand new employees, including their expectations and perceptions about their new roles as well as how well they’re adapting to the company. “Because pulse surveys are brief, they can surface what’s top-of-mind for your employees and help you respond quickly,” she adds. 
  2. Employee engagement  
 Employee engagement and communication tools have also seen a spike. 
 Among Japanese companies, decreased communication has been cited as a key concern faced by those having to manage remote work, Laboratik’s Miura notes. 
 Known as We, Laboratik’s flagship product uses natural language processing technology to examine a company’s interactions on work chat software Slack and identify communication issues between teams and people. By the end of the year, We will also integrate Teams, Microsoft’s collaboration platform. 
 Laboratik, which counts nursing care-related staffing agencies to entertainment and gaming companies among its clients, is seeing three to four times more inquiries than usual on its analytics services in the past few months. 
  3. Advisory services  
 Another major area of interest is the skills that leaders or managers need to have to operate remote teams. After pinpointing and assessing gaps, EngageRocket suggests steps that companies can take to help managers become better at handling remote workers. 
 EngageRocket has collected data from over 120 companies in Singapore to date. Clients can use this information to benchmark themselves against others in the industry, checking the effectiveness of their WFH, mental health, and employee engagement, among other factors. 
 “We’re sitting on pretty much the largest representative sample of sentiment-related data at the workplace in Singapore, from the start of the  circuit breaker  until now, which is quite exciting,” Leong says. 
  4. Post-hiring services  
 Remote hiring has also boosted demand for post-hiring services from firms that want to build teams abroad but may not necessarily have an office or the administrative capabilities to do so.

 “When you hire someone in foreign markets, many employers don’t usually want to take care of things like insurance, office seats, tax calculations, or BPJS – Indonesia’s equivalent of the Central Provident Fund in Singapore. So after we hire a candidate for them, we offer this full-stack solution, and HR services as well,” Glints’ Yeo explains. 
 Glints has placed over a hundred engineers on behalf of AIA Singapore in Indonesia and handles payroll, taxes, insurance, and the provision of offices through partnerships with co-working spaces there. But the firm didn’t have a breakdown of how much demand for these services have increased in the past months. 
 Will the trend persist? 
 Not all recruiters are as optimistic as Glints. Eng Chang Chua, a director at recruitment firm Space Executive who hires senior roles in legal and compliance, thinks the phenomenon temporary, given the current restrictions on travel. 
 “For some of these hires, especially senior key functional heads, [the arrangement would be] to move after the borders open up,” Chua says, referring to a recent placement involving senior staff for a leading fintech company in Singapore. 
 The feasibility of cross-border hiring also hinges on seniority and the requirements of the role. Face-to-face interaction isn’t as important for legal work involving contract advisory and reviews, which can be completed through digital means, he observes. 
 Hiring CEOs who are not yet in the country they are supposed to head, on the other hand, would be tough, according to Chua. 
 Overall, most companies are still expected to adopt a local-first approach to train and hire talent, says Daljit Sall, senior director for Randstad Singapore’s technology practice. While the cross-border trend can complement local hiring efforts, it’s unlikely to be a priority. 
 Nevertheless, it’s a practice that’s likely to stay, despite mixed results. According to global LinkedIn data, 44% of senior leaders said they’re evaluating more permanent remote work policies. 
 “Even in our own internal data, only 2% want to be back in the office five days a week. This is a big change that organisations are going to have to grapple with,” points out Culture Amp’s Stevens.

 Employers are doing their best to adapt. Searches for “remote working” on subscription-based tool LinkedIn Learning have tripled between January to June this year, says Feon Ang, the professional network’s vice president for talent and learning solutions for Asia Pacific. 
 “This may be indicative of the future of work, where remote work or work flexibility is no longer a perk but increasingly becoming an expectation,” Ang says.

651340,Indonesia’s Social Bella bags $58m in series E money," Indonesian beauty startup  Social Bella  announced that it has secured US$58 million in a series E funding round from existing investors Temasek, Pavilion Capital, and Jungle Ventures. 
 The company will use the new funds to scale up its tech infrastructure and further boost its growth in the beauty and personal care market in Indonesia, which is expected to grow to US$8.5 billion by 2022.

 Founded in 2015, Social Bella has evolved from an ecommerce platform to an online and offline ecosystem. It launched a flagship omnichannel store last year. To date, it has six physical stores across Indonesia. 
 Apart from its online and offline platform Sociolla, Social Bella also offers an end-to-end distributor service for beauty and personal care manufacturers. It also operates consumer review online platform SOCO as well as beauty and lifestyle online media  Beauty Journal , which also provides an online-to-offline marketing service. 
 The company also recently launched a new business line, Lilla by Sociolla, a beauty and personal care ecommerce service specifically designed for “young and sophisticated mothers.” 
  See:  7x GMV growth in 1 year: How Indonesian cosmetics e-tailer Sociolla did it   
  How much traction has it gotten?  With all its business units, Social Bella says it’s now serving a total of around 30 million annual users. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  With the pandemic, the company had to respond quickly to several changes in consumer behavior, such as a surge in online shopping and an increase in consumption of online information, Social Bella co-founder and CEO John Rasjid told  Tech in Asia . 
 During the quarantine period, the startup added a live chat feature so users can directly interact with beauty consultants. As a result, Social Bella claims it has seen an increase in organic traffic and a nearly 50% increase in basket size on Sociolla. 
  What are its future plans?  Moving forward, the company will continue to focus on commerce, content, and community, Rasjid said. 
 For now, it will spend its fresh capital on strengthening the back-end system for Sociolla and Lilla. It will also ramp up innovation at its Sociolla stores and enhance the user experience for SOCO.

651352,AMTD Digital to acquire payments platform Fomo Pay," Singapore-based  AMTD Digital , the integrated digital solutions arm of Hong Kong financial institution AMTD Group, said it’s set to acquire a controlling stake in QR code and payments solution provider  Fomo Pay  via a share swap and cash combination.

 Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
 The acquisition, which is subject to approval by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), will allow AMTD Digital to reinforce its strategic expansion plans in Southeast Asia, according to a statement. AMTD is also leading a  consortium  – which includes Xiaomi, SP Group, and Funding Societies – in its digibank bid in Singapore. 
 Founded in 2015, Singapore-based Fomo Pay provides a one-stop solution for merchants in the city-state and Malaysia by facilitating a variety of payment methods, including WeChat Pay, Baidu Wallet, Grab Pay, and Visa QR. 
 Its services are regulated by MAS and cover multiple industries such as airlines, publishing, tourism, food and beverage, education, and retail. Some of Fomo Pay’s notable clients include Singapore Press Holdings, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Airlines, Resorts World Sentosa, and Changi Airport. 
 After the acquisition, Fomo Pay will become a key member company within AMTD Digital, adding into the latter’s growing portfolio of digital financial services. 
 “Fomo Pay has grown significantly over the last few years as mobile payment adoption continues to thrive. This acquisition will allow us to embark on our next phase of growth and continue to provide more value-added service for business and brands,” said Fomo Pay co-founder and CEO Louis Liu Xi. 
 The chief exec also said that Fomo Pay will now be able to tap into AMTD’s extensive network in the Greater Bay Area, mainland China, and Southeast Asia. 
 The latest deal marks AMTD Digital’s third strategic acquisition in Singapore’s fintech industry recently. 
 In June of this year, it acquired CapBridge, Singapore’s first regulated securities exchange for digital assets and private companies. Before that, it bought a controlling stake in insurtech company  PolicyPal  for an eight-figure sum.

651354,The instant rise and fall of Luckin Coffee," Luckin Coffee’s fortunes have changed in a flash. Founded in 2017, the Starbucks rival became a unicorn within a year, and in April 2019, it’s valuation ballooned to nearly  US$3 billion .

 In less than three years after its founding, Luckin filed for an initial public offering in the US. But the coffee chain’s shares and market value have since dipped, as its management team was found to have committed financial fraud. 
 Here’s a timeline of what happened. 
 An instant coffee chain success 
  July 2018:  About nine months after it opened its first store in Beijing, Luckin secured US$200 million in a series A round and reached a valuation of US$1 billion. Singapore’s state fund GIC put in money at this stage. 
 The coffee wars heat up a few months later. Luckin announced a partnership with Chinese tech giant  Tencent  to tap into WeChat’s massive user base and co-develop offline retail payments tech. Starbucks, meanwhile, had tied up with Tencent rival Alibaba’s Ele.me for deliveries. 
  December 2018:  Luckin snapped up another  US$200 million  in its series B round from some existing investors. It was valued at US$2.2 billion. 
  April 2019:  The coffee chain secured US$150 million from investors including global asset manager BlackRock. 
 With a valuation of US$2.9 billion and an ambitious plan to open 2,500 new cafes, Luckin  filed  for an IPO in the US, intending to trade on Nasdaq. 
  May 2019:  Luckin’s shares soared on its first trading day on May 17. The coffee chain priced its IPO at US$17 per share for an intended  US$4 billion  market value, but the opening trade surged to US$25 per share. Shares closed at US$20.38 apiece. 
  January 2020:  The Chinese company raised  US$865 million  in a post-IPO offering to fuel its expansion plans. At this point, Luckin claimed that it was the biggest coffee chain in China with more than 4,500 outlets, surpassing Starbucks’ 3,600 stores. 
 Too good to be true 
  February 2020:  This is where things took a turn. Due diligence-based investment firm Muddy Waters Research said they would “short” Luckin’s stock after it received an  anonymous 89-page report  containing allegations of inflated numbers on items sold per store, among other things. Luckin denied the allegations. 
  April 2020:  Luckin’s shares  plunged  by as much as 80% as the company announced an internal probe into its alleged fabricated revenue. This wiped out almost US$5 billion from the company’s market value. 
  May 2020:  Luckin  fired  co-founder and CEO Jenny Qian and chief operating officer Jian Liu as evidence “sheds more light on the fabricated transactions,” the company said. Jinyi Guo, a board director and senior vice president at Luckin, was appointed as acting CEO. 
 On May 15, Nasdaq  notified  Luckin of its plans to delist the company’s shares from the exchange, citing public interest concerns over the coffee chain’s alleged fabricated transactions. The Chinese company requested for a hearing on May 22. 
  June 2020:  Luckin received  another delisting notice  from Nasdaq, which cited the company’s failure to file its 2019 annual report as an additional basis for removing its shares from the exchange. 
 Booted out 
 On June 30, trading of Luckin’s shares was  suspended  following the Chinese company’s withdrawal of its request for a hearing. According to a statement, Luckin said it no longer expects Nasdaq to reverse the decision to delist its shares from the exchange. 
  July 2020:  On July 1, Luckin announced the results of its internal investigation, confirming that about  US$300 million  in revenue and around US$190 million in cost and expenses were fabricated in 2019. As a result, the company terminated Qian and Liu from the board of directors, along with some 12 employees who were involved in the fraudulent transactions. 
 On July 13, Luckin said it has  ousted  co-founder and board chairman Charles Lu following a board meeting. Former acting CEO Guo was appointed to replace him and lead Luckin as the new CEO.

651071,So what if livestreaming ecommerce is hot?,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Dear readers, 
 When I was a kid, I loved going to the supermarket to get free food – ice cream, fish fingers, chips, etc. – from sample stands. The staff would prepare the food and serve it to you fresh, in the hope that you’ll buy their products. 
 At the local neighborhood, you’ll sometimes hear salespeople loudly conducting demos to show what a great buy their non-sticking frying pans are. Good salespeople are not just good at hawking products, but they also entertain potential customers as they pitch. You’ll see them cracking jokes, doing tricks, and sometimes even getting the audience involved with their shows. 
 But as more people buy online, these human-intensive sales approaches are slowly disappearing. Not that they weren’t effective, but the return on investment is probably low as there’s always a limit to the number of people you can host in an offline setting. 
 With livestreaming, this kind of showmanship and salesmanship gets another chance to shine. In China, livestreaming was a US$61.2 billion industry in 2019, and this trend is fast catching on in Southeast Asia, partly because of Covid-19. 
 Our reporter, Melissa Goh, published a  fascinating deep dive into the trend , and it really got me thinking. If livestreaming ecommerce is going to be huge, what demands or innovations will it trigger under this new normal? Here’s a list of things that popped up in my head, for your consideration and imagination: 
 🔴  Livestreaming equipment . Any hardware startup building specifically for livestreaming can ride the wave. Sure, there are already cameras, microphone, audio equipment available in the market, but piecing them together with the livestream platform can be very daunting. Livestreamers will probably prefer to have an all-in-one setup that they can just plug and play. 
 👨‍💻  Livestreaming software . A real-time editor would be handy to help livestreamers look good when it’s showtime. Could there also be a WordPress for livestreaming? 
 📅  Livestreaming events . If more users are starting to accept livestreaming, it could catalyze growth in related alternatives such as virtual live events, concerts, and workshops. 
 👍  Livestreaming ad network . Could it give rise to a network that improves ad performance by analyzing product, speech, and audience during live shows? 
 🤳🏾  Livestreaming talent agency . A lot of businesses will be looking for livestreaming talent to catch this trend, but there’s a shortage in the industry. Business models could be based on cost-per-acquisition or fixed hourly rate. Influencer agencies may have to pivot fast in order to capitalize on this. 
 🛍️  Livestreaming-focused ecommerce . Could it lead to a vertically focused ecommerce platform built just for livestreamers? And showcase products that can sell better on livestreams? For example, items with higher price tags such as laptops, beauty products, and even durians may do better because people do want to “experience” them before buying. 
 On the other hand, day-to-day products like shampoo, milk, eggs, or bread wouldn’t do as well because a static ecommerce page will do just fine. People generally don’t deliberate as much when purchasing fast-moving consumer goods because habits tend to lead them to their familiar brands. 
   
 The chart above illustrates what I mean. The higher the cost, the bigger the resistance to purchasing the item on the spot. The sweet spot for livestreaming is in the middle: The price isn’t exorbitant and people are still willing to buy at once, as long as they are convinced by the livestreamer’s demos. The high margins in the middle also suggest it’s good for businesses and justifies a livestreamer’s cost of sale.

651316,Payfazz closes $53m in series B round,"  Payfazz , a startup that provides financial and payment services through agents, just raised US$53 million in series B funding. 
 The round was led by B Capital Group and Insignia Ventures Partners, along with existing investors Tiger Global Management, Y Combinator, ACE &amp; Company, and Quiet Capital. New backers such as BRI Ventures – the venture arm of the biggest bank in Indonesia – also participated. 
 The company will use the fresh capital to strengthen its ecosystem of financial services in Indonesia’s rural economy and explore new opportunities across Southeast Asia. 
 
  Payfazz team / Photo credit: Payfazz 
 
 Payfazz’s app helps users buy prepaid phone credit, pay electricity bills, and top up mobile wallets through an agent. The platform currently has a network of more than 250,000 active agents. Payfazz also claims that about 10 million Indonesians make transactions via its agents every month. 
 Since its inception in 2016, the Jakarta-based company has expanded its offerings to include more financial services like peer-to-peer lending, a point-of-sale system, and a freelancer marketplace. 
   ﻿  ﻿  ﻿  ﻿   
   ﻿   
     
 Payfazz is the first Indonesian startup to join Y Combinator,  attending  the accelerator program in 2017. 
  What problem is it solving?  Most people in Indonesia don’t have access to financial institutions. According to a 2019 report by Google and Temasek, 92 million out of 181 million adults in the country don’t have a bank account. Moreover, 50% of those with a bank account don’t have access to additional services like lending, investment, and insurance. 
 Payfazz wants to bridge the gap between banks and people through its agent network. It started by providing popular features like buying phone credit and paying bills to quickly attract agents and users, then it ventured into other services such as lending. 
 According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report in 2018, around 74% of middle- to low-income individuals and micro, small, and medium enterprises in Indonesia have no access to loans. 
  What’s its traction?  In 2019, Payfazz processed US$1.2 billion in annual transactions, up from the US$250 million it recorded in 2018. It earns a 1% commission for each transaction completed on the app. 
  Who are the team members?  Hendra Kwik, Jefriyanto, and Ricky Winata are childhood friends from the Jambi province. After graduating from college, all of them worked in startups: Kwik in Kudo, Jefriyanto in Indonesia Flight, and Winata in Traveloka. In 2016, they decided to build Payfazz. 
 The startup now has 400 employees, with half of the team working in product and tech. 
  What is its funding history?

651282,"Grab, partner face $3m fine in Indonesia for unfair driver treatment","  Grab Indonesia  and its partner have been fined a total of over US$3 million by the country’s competition watchdog, which deemed the ride-hailing major guilty of demonstrating preferential treatment to some of its driver-partners. 
 
  Photo credit: Grab 
 
 The company gave a favorable allotment of priority orders to drivers of Teknologi Pengangkutan Indonesia (TPI), its affiliate car-rental firm, according to the Business Competition Supervisory Commission (KPPU). 
 The agency ruled that this practice has resulted in “monopolistic practices and unfair business competition” for Grab Indonesia’s individual driver-partners and non-TPI drivers. 
 In a case hearing for the trial, KPPU considered that the agreement between Grab and TPI was aimed at controlling the country’s tech-based ride-hailing market, which resulted in a decline in orders for non-TPI drivers. 
 As a result, the agency imposed fines of 30 billion rupiah (US$2 million) for Grab Indonesia and 19 billion rupiah (US$1.3 million) for TPI. 
 However, Grab believes it didn’t violate regulations. 
 “Grab’s partnership with PT TPI is established with the simple goal of benefiting all our driver-partners through ease of access to vehicles,” a Grab Indonesia spokesperson told  Tech in Asia . “Second, we have always believed in providing equal economic opportunities for all our driver-partners. Our booking system is fair and purely based on performance and merit, as Grab aims to maintain a positive and respectful user environment for everyone.” 
 The ride-hailer emphasized that no preferential treatment is given to driver-partners who are registered with TPI. “Grab driver-partners registered with TPI consistently provide quality service to passengers. They would be equally entitled to the same benefit programmes as all other driver-partners who are registered with other fleet companies,” the company said. 
 KPPU’s decision comes as Grab as a whole anticipates “ a long recovery period ” and a prolonged economic recession due to Covid-19. 
 In late 2019, the company also landed in hot water in Malaysia for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the country. The Malaysia Competition Commission fined the Singapore-based company  US$20.9 million  for preventing its drivers from “promoting and providing advertising services for its competitors.” 
 Grab repeatedly said it has fully complied with local laws and requested for a review on the decision, but the agency dismissed the proposal earlier this year. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(3, 0.9996702)]",['KPPU'],"['Asia', 'Singapore', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia']"

 Hello readers, 
 TGIF! But before we end the work week, let’s look into an Indonesian ecommerce startup’s bold claims first, shall we? Let’s get right into it. 
  Your quick bytes for today:  
 🚶‍♂️ Is this a season of change? Because Chinese ecommerce major Pinduoduo  has a new CEO , naming its chief technology officer Lei Chen to the post. 
 💸 Feeling the pinch: An insider at TikTok said the India ban could cost ByteDance more than  $6 billion in lost revenue . 
 👋 Bye bye, Lasso – Facebook  shuts down  its version of the short-video app to make way for Reels, a TikTok-like feature within Instagram. 
 🚓 Not good news: Police in Ho Chi Minh City  have issued a notice  to Loic Gautier, CEO of Vietnam-based ecommerce startup Leflair, asking for his assistance in their investigations. 
 🎥 The company on everyone’s radar since last month, India’s Reliance Jio, has launched JioMeet, a video conference tool that looks  a lot like Zoom . 
 🤖 North + Google – The search engine giant has acquired a  smart glasses startup , joining fellow tech giants  Apple ,  Samsung ,  Facebook , and  Microsoft  in the race to develop computers that we can stick on our faces. 
 Startup hits US$1 billion in annual GMV in less than two years? 
   
Indonesia’s GudangAda connects retailers that need to stock up on fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) like packaged food, toiletries, or over-the-counter drugs to wholesalers who sell them. 
 And recently, the ecommerce marketplace made some claims that have  definitely turned heads  (🔒). 
  Check out these numbers : 
Launched at the end of 2018, GudangAda said it has: 
 
 Processed US$1 billion in transactions in the past 12 months 
 Acquired 80,000 big retailers 
 Onboarded almost all of the 20,000 FMCG wholesalers in Indonesia  
 
 OK, but wait a minute: Our writer talked to eight big retailers and five wholesalers in the FMCG sector of Greater Jakarta and found that none of them have used the app. Ten of them haven’t heard of it. 
 GudangAda has offered data access for verification to any interested parties post NDA while investors remained bullish about the startup. 
 “Look at the number of wholesalers and retailers already on the platform. Look at the amount of GMV they process. Look at how little time they took to get here. Nobody even comes close,” one of them said.

Botsync builds mobile robots that can transport items up to 1,000 kilograms. 
 It recently raised an  undisclosed amount  of seed funding to extend its services to the logistics and manufacturing sectors. 
  Robotic Hercules?  
Launched in 2017, ased Botsync designs robots to automate repetitive tasks, such as moving heavy goods from point to point so that humans can focus on more value-adding activities. 
 The Singapore-based startup claims that its solutions can help clients slash about 45% of their operational costs. 
 One of the current challenges it faces is the cost and integration of its tech, as businesses still find it difficult to set aside large upfront capital investments for automation. 
 With the fresh funds, Botsync aims to deploy around 10 to 15 robots by the end of the year and to expand in the region, especially in Southeast Asia and India. 
 According to a 2020 Market Study report, the global market for autonomous mobile robots is expected to grow to US$600 million by the end of 2025, up from just US$180 million in 2017.

651237,"2C2P is profitable, hits $81.3m in revenue in 2019","    
  
 ||item|| 
 Payments platform 2C2P has posted improved financial results, achieving profitability in 2019. 
 The Singapore- and Bangkok-based company generated US$81.3 million in revenue, up 57.5% from the year prior. 
 Most of the revenue came from concluded service agreements, which contributed US$44.1 million, while the rest was from sales of e-merchandise. 
 2C2P operates payment gateway, corporate card issuance, digital wallet, and remittance services and is also a wholesaler of digital goods – it purchases digital codes from telco and gaming companies by bulk and sells them in retail. It’s likely that the revenue from the “sales of e-merchandise” refers to this wholesaler business. 
  Tech in Asia  has reached out to 2C2P, but it did not respond to our questions. 
 Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the company said that it was on track to hit  US$100 million  in revenue this year. 
 Landing big-name clients such as tech giants Facebook and Apple as well as ecommerce majors Lazada and Zalora no doubt aided the company in achieving its current milestone. 
 It also made headway in the industry by working with online travel companies and regional airlines, which were some of its earliest clients. These include the likes of Agoda, Traveloka, Philippine Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, and Thai Airways, among others. 
 According to the firm, travel companies remain to be the biggest contributor to its gross merchandise volume. However, it’s unclear how 2C2P’s GMV will be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, which wiped out business for the travel sector. 
 Nevertheless, the company recorded a total comprehensive income of US$2.1 million for the full year. In comparison, it posted comprehensive losses of US$1.1 million in 2018 and US$2.2 million in 2017. 
    
  
 Despite this, 2C2P’s total costs and expenses hit US$79.7 million for full-year 2019, up from the US$52.8 million in the prior year. 
    
  
 The company’s total liabilities also went up during the year, mainly due to increased trade and other payables. 
    
  
 That said, it still has a comfortable cash cushion. In November last year, 2C2P bagged  US$52 million  in new funding from an international group of investors, including IFC, Cento Ventures, and Arbor Ventures. 
 This pushed the startup’s total funding to US$70 million, including the US$18 million it secured across its previous funding rounds from investors such as GMO Venture Partners, Amun Capital, and Digital Spring Ventures. 
    
  
 As a result, the company saw a spike in total assets, more than doubling its 2018 numbers and nearly quadrupling its 2017 results. 
    
     
 2C2P founder and group CEO Aung Kyaw Moe previously mentioned that with this profitability, the company was in a position to “carefully select” its shareholders and finances to achieve growth. 
 Last year, it was reported that 2C2P turned down an acquisition offer from ride-hailing giant Grab, but the chief exec previously told  Tech in Asia  that while the company held talks with a few strategic investors including Grab, those talks “went nowhere” near a potential deal. 
 This year, the company began venturing into investments with 2C2P.VC. The new entity looks for fintech opportunities across the region that can help the startup strengthen its core markets, namely Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Singapore. 
 According to Aung Kyaw Moe, the company views 2C2P.VC as a “critical component” in its overall growth, allowing it to eye several companies with technologies, products, or a geographic presence that synergizes with 2C2P’s.

650678,A step-by-step guide to crafting the perfect fundraising pitch deck," While it’s hard to tell a startup what exactly to put in its pitch deck, there’s an effective framework that can help a company build one. 
 As one of the more famous VC firms in the world, Sequoia Capital’s pitch deck is worthy of a deep review, and it can be a model for any company. 
 Sequoia Capital’s pitch deck template 
 The company’s deck is made up of 10 key slides: 
 
 Company purpose 
 Problem 
 Solution 
 “Why now?” 
 Market size 
 Competition 
 Product 
 Business model 
 Team 
 Financials 
 
 One immediately noticeable thing about it is the simplicity of its slides. Design can be helpful in clarifying ideas, but they should be a secondary focus; the content is far more important. 
 The first rule: Humans have a short attention span 
 The most important information needs to be stated at the start of the pitch. If a meeting is an hour long, it’s a rookie mistake to assume receiving a full hour of the audience’s attention. It would be smarter to have a 30-minute presentation instead and allot the remaining 30 minutes for Q&amp;As, with supporting slides. 
 The typical attention span during an investor meeting follows this curve, which must be taken into consideration when building a deck: 
 
  Angel investor and venture capital investor attention span 
 
 If a startup can’t convince investors that its idea is interesting within the first five minutes of a presentation, they will most probably lose interest in following through with the investment. The first few minutes of a pitch must coherently present crystal-clear ideas. 
 Company purpose 
 
  Sequoia Capital investor deck: company purpose 
 
 This slide must define what a company does in a single declarative statement. While that sounds easy, it’s often the most difficult part of the process – and also extremely important. 
 It shouldn’t be bogged down with explanations of features, products, or metrics; the focus should be on communicating the startup’s mission. 
 And this doesn’t mean telling investors about the company vision, either. This part is all about what the business does and what it will achieve. 
 Problem 
 
  Sequoia Capital investor deck: problem 
 
 This is where the value a company provides to customers is made evident. The problem it is addressing must be made clear and easy for investors to understand, even if it means making the extra effort to convince them that the issue is actually a problem. 
 For example, instead of presenting the lack of means of transportation as a problem, an electric car company could instead point to climate change and offer their product as a way humans can be more environmentally friendly. 
 While bigger pain points are better, it’s important to remain true to the company. 
 Furthermore, there are some differences between consumer-facing versus business-facing companies: 
 
 For a consumer-facing company, it’s important to talk about what its users need, as the gaps in their lives are how it makes money. 
 For enterprise products, showing a detailed understanding of the customers’ issues is more meaningful in gaining investors’ confidence. 
 
 If a startup cannot convince investors that it is trying to fix a deeply broken problem, then it simply has a solution that’s still looking for a problem. And if investors don’t believe there is one, they won’t invest in the company. 
 Solution 
 
  Sequoia Capital investor deck: solution 
 
 Now that the problem has been made clear, it’s time to pitch the solution. 
 The first step is for the company to explain  how  it solves the problem. Try to accomplish this task in one to two sentences, followed by answers to the following questions: 
 
 What was the startup’s “eureka moment?” 
 Why is its value proposition unique and compelling? 
 Why will it endure? What is its competitive advantage? What prevents another company from taking the same idea and executing it better? 
 Where can the company grow? How big can the idea become? 
 
 “Why now?” 
 
  Sequoia Capital investor deck: Why now? 
 
 The best companies always have a clear answer to the question, “Why now?” One of the most successful tech companies in history, Microsoft thrived because it was able to provide affordable personal computers at a time when they were just a luxury for the wealthy. 
 A startup must review the industry it is in: What has happened that now makes its product/service essential, and why is it the best time for people to buy what it is selling? 
 It should also be able to clearly answer the question, “Why hasn’t this solution been built before?” There is often a good reason why nobody has pursued the same idea yet, so if the pitch can preemptively answer the question, it will go a long way toward earning investors’ interest. 
 Market potential 
 
  Sequoia Capital investor deck: market size 
 
 Business is not a charity, and the point of investing is to eventually make more money than what has been put in. 
 This is why this part of the deck needs to clearly explain the market. Remember: Having a 1% market share of a US$100 billion industry is better than having a 50% market share of a US$10 million industry. 
 There are two strategies for presenting the market to investors: 
 
 Top down: Moving from the overall global market size down to the more specific sub-sectors the company is targeting. 
 Bottom up: Starting at the smallest portion of the market then moving to the overall global market size. 
 
 Some jargon that can be used to give a sense of market size include: 
 
 Total addressable market (TAM): This is total revenue opportunity. 
 Serviceable addressable market (SAM): The metric refers to the obtainable revenue opportunity. 
 Share of market (SOM): This is the percentage of the market that can be captured. 
 
 Here is an example of how these ideas can be presented: 
   
 In this slide, both the customer and the market must be clearly identified. If a startup is creating a new market, a.k.a., a “blue ocean,” the number of users or customers available for its product/service must be explained. 
 This number should also grow over time, so investors must be given a timetable of customer acquisition growth that could be reasonably expected within the next year, followed by the next 5 and 10 years, along with an explanation of how much each of these users/customers is worth. Microsoft, for instance, makes a lot more money per customer than Uber, so the firm doesn’t require as many users to reach profitability. 
 Competition 
 
  Sequoia Capital investor deck: competition 
 
 The quickest way to lose investors’ interest is to say, “We don’t have competitors because nobody thinks like us.” 
 Even Airbnb, who didn’t have competition from other startups, identified traditional hotels as their rivals, and that understanding helped them successfully navigate the market. 
 Startups must take the time to do research on their direct and indirect competitors and check existing solutions that provide values similar to theirs. 
   
 This section will probably require some explanation, which also presents a good opportunity to pinpoint a company’s most direct rivals. 
 Product 
 
  Sequoia Capital investor deck: product 
 
 Early-stage startups usually make their first pitch before they’ve even generated any revenue, making their product pitch particularly important. 
 For this part of the pitch, it’s good to have a product demonstration, because people learn differently; some investors may not understand the product until they see it. 
 To make sure the product pitch isn’t a flop, there can be a recorded demo of the product that presents its key features that fit the company’s value proposition. This way, the presenter can pause the video and provide answers, in case investors jump in with questions and concerns. 
 If a demo can’t be recorded for some reason, there should still be screenshots of the product and its key features included in the deck. 
 Business model 
 
  Sequoia Capital investor deck: business model 
 
 At this point, the pitch must have already explained the problem, the solution, the product, and the addressable market. Now it’s time to explain how the company makes money. 
 For this part, it’s crucial to get into specifics. Visualizing a transaction and explaining how it works would be helpful: Is it a subscription? A one-off purchase? A mix of both? Does the business make money from consumers or companies? Depending on the business model and the stage a company is in, this can be presented differently. 
 The hardest part of this slide is figuring out the pricing model – it takes a lot of research, a bit of math, and a sprinkle of gut instinct – but it would give investors an idea about the feasibility of the business. 
 It shouldn’t be a cause for worry if the startup’s product or service is about 25% more expensive or 25% cheaper than what is already available. The homework is meant to make sure it isn’t pricing its product too high or too low compared to the potential market expectations. 
 Finally, revenue streams must be curated through the selection of and the concentration on the top business model. A company may have different ways to make money, but those can be explained later in the investment process. 
 Those that already have a track record should definitely share their unit economics, such as customer acquisition cost, retention rate, churn rate, or even customer lifetime value. 
 In a series A round or beyond, venture capital investors will want to understand the unit economics in detail. 
 Team 
 
  Sequoia Capital investor deck: team 
 
 If investors are interested at this point, they’ll want to know about the founders and the team. VCs invest in people first and companies second. While they may love a company, they won’t back it if they don’t trust the people in it to execute the plan. 
 It’s worth spending a couple of minutes on the founders’ backgrounds and highlighting any special talents or experiences that make them capable of building the business. 
 If a startup has an A-team, that information should be put up front, as it will definitely add a lot of credibility to the rest of the pitch. 
 However, mentioning advisers is not that big of a deal; they can be included quickly or ignored altogether. Unless they really add value to a company, including them in the pitch won’t make much of an impact. 
 Financials 
 
  Sequoia Capital investor deck: financials 
 
 It’s not advisable to include heavy financials in a pitch deck because they usually require some context. 
 Instead, this part can be split into two slides: 
 
 Financial slide: This must feature a simple profit and loss statement, with a focus on revenue growth, the number of clients served, or key metrics. For software-as-a-service businesses, they can mention the high-level monthly or annual recurring revenue. 
 Deal slide: Funds that a company is raising and the amount committed by existing investors or other investors must be mentioned here. Also to be included are the cap table and how the company will invest the capital. Sequoia suggests keeping it simple; areas to possibly focus on are:
 
 The headcount and salaries of the team (potentially by department) 
 Marketing and acquisition 
 Other operating expenses 
 
 
 
 Finally, the pitch must conclude with the company’s potential next steps.

651210,Intel is Jio Platforms’ newest investor with $253m injection," India’  Jio Platforms  today announced that it will be receiving around US$253 million in investment from Intel Capital, the venture capital firm of global chipmaker Intel, in exchange for a 0.39% equity stake.

 US-based Intel Capital is the newest member in Jio’s growing roster of  big-name backers , which include Facebook, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, TPG Capital, L Catterton, and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. 
 To date, the digital services firm has raised about US$15.5 billion in less than three months. 
 Intel Capital focuses on investing in cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, AI, and 5G, among others. It has operated in India for more than two decades and employs thousands of people in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. 
 Since 1991, the company said it has invested US$12.9 billion in more than 1,582 companies worldwide, and 692 portfolio companies have gone public or participated in a merger. 
 According to Wendell Brooks, the firm’s president, Jio’s capability to bring low-cost digital services to India aligns with Intel’s purpose of delivering technology to enrich lives. “Through this investment, we are excited to help fuel digital transformation in India, where Intel maintains an important presence,” he added. 
 Jio, which aims to enable a digital India for 1.3 billion people, operates Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, the largest telco in India. 
 Most recently, it launched a video conferencing tool called JioMeet to take on the likes of Zoom and Google Meet. It offers free unlimited high-definition calls and can support up to 100 participants in a call. 
 With over 560 million internet users, India is currently the second-largest online market globally. It’s estimated to have more than 650 million internet users by 2023, according to Statista.

649879,Popsical bags $5m to bring a ‘Spotify for karaoke’ to Southeast Asia," A lot of Asians are obsessed with karaoke, so it’s not surprising that the karaoke market is expected to grow by almost 3% every year to become worth  US$5.7 billion  by 2024. 
 Singapore-based  Popsical  is eyeing a slice of the pie by delivering a Spotify-like approach to this go-to recreational activity. 
 Recently, it announced closing a S$6.9 million (or nearly US$5 million) series A round led by Quest Ventures. Seeds Capital, the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore, also participated in the round alongside early investors Apricot Capital, Teo Heng KTV, Cash Studios KTV, OMG Ventures, and Mediacorp. 
 As part of the deal, Quest Ventures partner Jeffrey Seah will be joining Popsical’s board of directors, according to a statement.

 Founded in 2016, Popsical aims to make the user experience for karaoke as smooth as possible. Its cloud-based Popsical Remix system offers a self-updating library of over 200,000 songs in 14 languages. The device itself is also compact, removing the need for people to use numerous and complicated technical equipment. 
 The startup said it will use the new funds to boost its digital capabilities, expand to new markets, hire go-to-market talent, and develop a roadmap for other products and SaaS services. 
  What problem is it solving?  “We think that karaoke is outdated,” Popsical co-founder and CEO Faruq Marican told  Tech in Asia , noting that traditional systems are usually prohibitively expensive and poorly designed, hardware- and user experience-wise. 
 “We figured this is why KTVs are still going strong while video game arcades largely disappeared. There was never a ‘karaoke PlayStation,'” the chief exec said. Other services such as Joox or Smule try to emulate the experience through apps, but the experience is not the same, he added. 
 With Popsical Remix, both mixer and device are combined into one palm-sized system. It also comes with two wireless microphones. 
  What’s the opportunity?  Citing a 360 Research report, the company said karaoke’s popularity has boosted the market’s value to US$4.2 billion globally in 2020. 
 To date, the startup has sold over 12,000 of its Remix system, which costs S$499 apiece. Content is available on its platforms with a 24-hour subscription package at S$4.99 or a monthly fee of S$10.90 after a free one-month trial period. 
 “As big as the market was for karaoke devices, it’s still probably a fraction of what we can address with the Popsical Remix and offerings to come,” said Marican. He shared that they are still developing newer hardware to deliver gamified and livestreaming karaoke experiences. 
  What are its challenges?  In order to maximize the opportunity, Marican said they have to control the entire experience by building on all levels of the stack. That includes software development, content acquisition, and the combination of hardware design and manufacturing, which the company considers as the most difficult part of the process. 
 “This means that you usually have to lean towards perfectionism over simply deploying the product as soon as it is minimally viable. Once deployed, there is an incredible number of points where the supply and value chain can break,” Marican explained. 
  How much traction is it targeting to get?  So far, the company has sold close to 20,000 of its systems in Singapore and Malaysia. Without disclosing hard targets, Marican said the company aims to replicate this product-market fit in other countries. 
 It aims to start expanding in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. 
 Getting Quest Ventures on board may also help. With support from Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund QazTech Ventures for its  US$50 million  fund, the Singapore-based VC firm can help bridge Popsical to opportunities not only in Southeast Asia but also Central Asia. 
  Who are the team members?  Popsical has roughly 20 employees right now. At the helm is Marican, who previously served as vice president of global investment bank Banq. 
 He co-founded the company alongside Fadhli Rahim, who currently acts as Popsical’s chief technology officer.

650960,Startup survival beyond Covid-19: What SEA founders are doing," Entrepreneurs are optimists, sometimes to a fault. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, many have hoped for a V-shaped economic recovery. But here in Southeast Asia, where our firm Golden Gate Ventures invests in 10 countries, we see the smartest startups gearing up for an L-shaped curve – the kind of recovery with a long bottom and uncertain future.

 This strategy is more than a matter of being cautious, and we recommend that founders should simply manage realistically. 
 “They used to be peacetime CEOs, and now they need to be wartime CEOs. Now is a good time to focus on survival,” Helen Wong, a partner at Qiming Venture Partners, said during  an online panel  we hosted recently. 
 The purpose of the event was to get an investor’s-eye view of the road ahead after Covid-19 from a diverse group of global limited partners (LP) and general partners (GP). The panelists remained upbeat overall but sounded some ominous downbeats for startups, especially those in search of venture funding. 
 Why we’re facing a “new abnormal” 
 LP David Gonino, head of the Alfred I. duPont Charitable Trust, proclaimed: “Business is alive and well, although at a much slower pace.” This means the industry will see fewer deals that take longer to do. 
 Gonino and another US-based LP, Ed Grefenstette of The Dietrich Foundation, also see a wide range of investment options amid the emerging climate. Private credit deals, public securities, and buyouts of distressed assets will all compete for capital with private equity. 
 Now to flesh out the picture, add in the global economic forecasts that have been published.  The International Monetary Fund’s “baseline scenario”  projected a grim 2020, followed by a hard-won upward trend in 2021. But this included a host of best-case assumptions, and the IMF warned, “The risks for even more severe outcomes… are substantial.” 
 One core problem is  shrinking demand . When cash-strapped or unemployed people buy less, everyone’s gears grind down 
 In Southeast Asia, Malaysia’s economy and government rely heavily on Petronas, the state-owned oil and gas company. What if oil prices  stay low  as people drive and fly less? Samsung makes most of its smartphones in Vietnam, where it is the country’s largest private employer. What if  sales of consumer electronics  continue to slump? And what if a new global crisis strikes before we recover from this one? 
 Maybe a combined worst-case scenario is just as improbable as a confluence of best cases, but it doesn’t take a perfect economic storm to sink small boats like startups. 
 Our firm’s advice to founders/CEOs in a nutshell: Survival, as noted, is job one. Think of the next 18 months or so as the new abnormal, a time to shed old habits while building healthy new ones. And don’t count on someone to throw you a lifeline; create your own. 
 Bad habits and must-do’s 
 All startups will need sufficient cash for at least a year and a half. Fundraising, however, should not be a priority. In this climate, valuations will be lower than usual, so you’ll end up giving more equity for less money. 
 If all else fails and you do need to raise funds, here are a few tips to avoid down rounds: 
 
 
 Debt : Use convertible notes as a bridge round. A note can even have a cap below the last round’s price. But keep in mind that debt financing is a double-edged sword, as it only means delaying the inevitable cash payback. 
 
 Secondaries : You can offer a mix of primary and secondary, where the secondary is at a discount. (In the current environment, a number of angels and early VCs will be more open to an early cash-out). 
 
 Warrants : These set a discounted price for the investor to buy in the future or upon exit. 
 
 In these abnormal times, startups should also stop subsidizing growth with extreme marketing spend and/or discounts to gain customers. 
 Sensible CEOs in the ASEAN region have already quit such “aggressive behaviors,” noted online panelist Chris Loh, managing partner of Axiom Asia Private Capital. They know that most venture investors (including me) won’t insist on hypergrowth. We want them to focus on unit economics, minimizing the cost and maximizing potential profit per transaction or item sold. If growth comes, the company can scale from solid footing. 
 Growth may even come unexpectedly. One of our portfolio companies, HipVan, sells furniture online. When the pandemic hit, the company’s sales increased despite a slowdown in furniture buying because people couldn’t or didn’t want to visit a physical store. 
 That said, every startup’s situation may differ. Grefenstette summed it up when he said, “It seems 20% of the portfolio companies are facing an existential threat, 20% have a tailwind in this environment, and 60% are in the middle.” 
 All startups, however, must have sound fundamentals. During hard times, every startup CEO should stay in survival mode, considering moves that could range from cost-cutting to drastic shifts in the business model. 
 Staying lean, innovating under duress 
 Smart founders learn from history. The dotcom crash of 2000 killed a lot of online companies that had pumped capital into unprofitable super-growth on the “go big or go home” philosophy. 
 One famous survivor was movie review site Rotten Tomatoes. It was then a small, lean company that got even leaner by combining staff cuts with voluntary pay cuts. Rotten Tomatoes co-founder Patrick Lee took zero salary and gave up his apartment, living in the office to ride out the storm. While not everyone needs to go that far, two CEOs in our portfolio have cut their own salaries by over 30% – a helpful move. 
 As startups position themselves for these drastic shifts, it is essential to be on the lookout for pitfalls they can avoid. One way founders can do this is to include their investors early on in the conversation, as these people have insights from other startups. Founders should also consider what an early “success” looks like with a pivot and remain transparent with their team on why the pivot took place and how they plan to measure its success. 
 More to the point: Survival mode doesn’t mean starving yourself in the hope that you will live to eat again someday. It’s an opportunity to position the company for the future by becoming more efficient, nimble, and creative. 
 Hard times separate the innovators from the me-too competitors. True innovators thrive under constraints and rise to the challenge. 
 Startups in today’s environment, though, face a tricky challenge: Their goals are not so well-defined. When cost control isn’t enough to survive and a strategy change or new revenue stream is needed, founders must identify what the new direction will be. Another portfolio company of ours, ServisHero, made a seemingly obvious yet dramatic series of moves to address its challenges. 
 The company, which connects consumers with home service providers, has been affected by the pandemic, as many customers would only buy urgently needed repairs. So it pivoted to create a new service for Covid-19 disinfection and testing and branched out the offering to its other markets. 
 With this, we urge all ASEAN startups to expand across borders. It’s a necessary diversification, not an extravagant expense. The pandemic is not over. Reopenings and economic trajectories will differ from one country to another, as will government interventions. Being tied to a single country could take you down. That’s why planting a beachhead or two elsewhere can open up near-term rescue routes that become long-term paths to growth. 
 Opportunities and leadership 
 Speaking of opportunities for growth, here’s a  list of opportunity sectors  we see, including some that might not be obvious: 
 
 Auto repair services could boom as an online-to-offline (O2O) or purely offline play.  With new car sales dropping  globally in this time, more people will need to keep their old vehicles running longer. 
 Workforce training has market potential, too. When big firms cut headcount, they often must repurpose their remaining people for new roles. 
 Regional or national governments are growth markets as well. They can become ongoing buyers of new smart city/smart infrastructure offerings. Systems for virus tracing are only part of the story. Burgeoning metro areas worldwide face a host of manageability issues – relieving traffic jams, cutting pollution, optimizing emergency services, and more. 
 
 Perhaps none of these fit your firm. But Qiming Venture Partners’ Wong identified one opportunity that calls out to every founder and CEO: the opportunity to show leadership. “What does your leadership mean?” she asked during our online panel. “How can you pull people together in a difficult time? How do you think about whether your business needs to be adjusted? What is your strategy going forward?” 
 “You have to make sacrifices,” Wong said. Founders must show that they, too, are willing to take some pain. 
 “To the credit of a lot of CEOs, we are seeing them step up. So I would really encourage entrepreneurs and managers to build strong, lasting businesses that can survive.” ",Vinnie Lauria,0,6,"[(0, 0.055307306), (1, 0.024798809), (3, 0.9198693)]","['ASEAN', 'Samsung', 'ServisHero', 'IMF']","['US', 'Vietnam', 'Malaysia', 'Petronas']"
651185,Vietnam police summon Leflair CEO," Police in Ho Chi Minh City have issued a notice asking for the cooperation of Loïc Gautier, chief executive of Vietnam-based ecommerce startup Leflair, to assist in their investigations. 
 The move comes after the city’s police department received complaints from several businesses, as Leflair failed to pay suppliers some 6.5 billion Vietnamese dong (US$280,000) for goods. Gautier could face charges such as misappropriation of goods and criminal breach of trust. 
 Speaking to  Tech in Asia , Gautier explained that the sum Leflair owes to suppliers amounts to “roughly US$2 million” in total and is equivalent to “about a month of cost of goods sold.” 
 
  Leflair co-founders Pierre-Antoine Brun (left) and Loic Gautier (right) / Photo credit: Leflair 
 
 So why did the complaints only cite US$280,000? 
 The CEO adds that the “vast majority” of Leflair’s former suppliers aren’t “out for blood and revenge” because they understand that “losses occur when it comes to running a business.” “They’re willing to let the court do its work,” he says. 
 But he and Brun were caught off guard by the police summons, as they hadn’t received “any news” from the People’s Court despite filing for bankruptcy months before. “It’s possible that there are simply too many bankruptcy applications following the lockdown of Vietnam’s economy,” explains Gautier. 
 “It seems that a number of creditors had been coercing the police to look into the matter so they would be able to disclose that to the press,” he says. “They’re probably doing this in hopes that Leflair would pay up,” he adds. 
 Gautier says the debt stemmed from the startup’s decision to operate for another month, despite already experiencing financial troubles. Leflair shut down its Vietnamese and Philippine offices in February and started bankruptcy proceedings in May. 
 “We should have thrown the towel a little earlier, but we overreached for about a month,” he says. Gautier adds that some suppliers have “actually been paid” from the deposits it gave them to be able to consign their goods in its warehouses. 
 Leflair previously told  Tech in Asia  that it runs on a consignment model. It’s an arrangement in which a consignor, who is typically a vendor, leaves goods in the possession of a third party – in this case, Leflair – to sell. The consignor receives a percentage of the revenue from the sale in the form of a commission. 
 If Gautier doesn’t come to work with the police within 30 days from the date of notice, the Vietnamese Investigation Police Department will “handle the case in accordance with the law,” according to local media reports. 
 Gautier says he’s “not downplaying responsibility” and that it’s “his job to face those accusations.” He also defended the decision to keep Leflair open despite being short on cash, saying that “it’s in no way illegal.” 
 “It’s regrettable that we have to come this far, but if it helps provide transparency to our creditors and show them that we have not misused the company funds, then so be it,” he stresses. 
 Co-founder Pierre-Antoine Brun tells  Tech in Asia  that Leflair is “getting in touch with the right authorities to know what is expected, so we will comply.” 
 According to Gautier, Leflair started experiencing financial issues in late November, when the startup was in “advanced” discussions for its series C round. Investors started to get cold feet because of the “winds changing” from  WeWorkGate  and the Covid-19 pandemic.

 Hello readers 
 Raise your hand if you own a powerbank. Now raise your other hand if your phone still often runs out of battery because you keep forgetting to either charge it or have your powerbank with you. 🙌 
 The shared powerbank sector was once considered a foolish idea. But look who’s laughing now as it dangles its US$1.1 billion market volume in front of those early naysayers. How did the concept grow? And will it take off in Southeast Asia? Scroll down for an analysis of this odd hype. 
  Your quick bytes for today:  
 ☕ The verdict is out: Luckin Coffee has indeed  committed fraud , inflating revenues by nearly $300 million. 
 🍔 Vegans in China are celebrating because Beyond Meat is  now available  on Alibaba’s Freshippo. 
 🎥 After India had banned 59 Chinese apps including TikTok, local social network Sharechat silently launched its  short-video app Moj . 
 🛍️ India ecommerce company Flipkart has also joined the game, launching the  new social commerce  platform 2GudSocial, which focuses on influencer-led video commerce. 
 🚚 Mumbai-based premium delivery service platform Scootsy will be  merging with  its parent company Swiggy.

 The ugly duckling of shared economies 
    
 You think betting on a losing team is bad? Try declaring online that “if powerbank sharing becomes successful, I’ll eat s**t” – only to find out a couple of years later that the shared powerbank market has become a US$1.1 billion market. 
 Powerbank rentals have become so commonplace in China that you would likely see a few of them just by walking around a mall. 
 While they have created a flourishing market in the country, will powerbank rentals also present a  lucrative opportunity in Southeast Asia  ( 🔒)? 
  So what’s the hype?  
To many millennials and Zoomers, seeing their smartphone batteries at less than 10% is equivalent to witnessing the end of the world. 
 To prevent that from happening, most people already own a powerbank, especially since it’s so inexpensive — no shame, I have at least three of them in my drawers right now. 
 So on the surface, shared powerbanks don’t make sense. 
 But what the sharing model does help with is this: People don’t have to worry about charging their powerbanks and carrying them around. They can just pick one up when they need it and then drop it off once they’re done. 
 “Every week, I probably rely on it three or four times,” an MBA student in Shanghai told us. 
  Let’s go back to the beginning  
Shared powerbanks started popping up in China in 2016, riding the wave of the sharing economy boom. 
 At the height of the trend in 2017, it was said that an estimated US$170 million had been pumped into powerbank-sharing businesses within a 40-day period. 
 This helped powerbank-sharing’s scope expand from business areas to recreational and F&amp;B establishments and public spaces like movie theaters, train stations, and airports across China. 
 There were so many different operators that a price war soon broke out, leaving only four surviving players: Monster Energy, Xiaodian, Jiedian, and Laidian. The powerbank-sharing hype gradually slowed down after that. 
 Currently, more than 2 million users still rent a powerbank at least once a week on average. 
 And there is still room for growth. Transaction volumes are estimated to reach US$2.1 billion in 2020, up from US$1.1 billion in 2019. Similarly, the sector’s user base is projected to reach 408 million, up from 305 million in 2019. 
 There are a lot more insights and charts — including the financial fundamentals of the business model in Southeast Asia from cost to breakeven point, thorough calculations of market opportunity and growth, and the many different challenges involved in scaling this business — in today’s  premium article  ( 🔒).

649992,Why second-tier cities are the next tech hotspots,"   ﻿  ﻿  ﻿  ﻿  ﻿   
 ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
  With most large cities getting highly urbanized and densely populated, a lot of people have started to look at living or investing in second-tier cities. After all, they can get the best of both worlds, with good infrastructure, job security, and work-life balance.  
  What makes tier-two cities in Asia unique, however, is how they’re growing faster than any other regions in the world.  
  The  top 10 fastest-growing cities  in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) will all be in India between 2019 and 2035, according to research firm Oxford Economics. Seven of these cities are in Tier 2.  
  The classification of city tiers   in each country may be different. In China, for example, second-tier cities have a GDP of  US$68 billion to US$299 billion  and a population of 3 million to 15 million.  
  According to the Word Economic Forum, the growth of Asian cities was mainly driven by a rapid rural-to-urban migration or the reclassification of rural areas into urban ones.  
  In Southeast Asia, this trend was most evident in Indonesia, accounting for  67%  of the archipelago’s urban growth. Moreover, one analysis finds that urbanization in the country could rise to  71% , covering about 209 million of the total population, by 2030.  
    
  Spending power  
  According to  McKinsey &amp; Company , China is seeing shifting trends in consumer spending. Young and tech-savvy consumers who live in lower-tier cities tend to spend more on lifestyle-related purchases. These areas are often characterized by a growing middle-class population and lower cost of living. People also tend to have more free time.  
  Morgan Stanley predicts that h  igher household income and a population boom will   triple consumer   spending to    US$6.9 trillion by 2030 from US$2.3 trillion in 2017 .   
  The middle class also seems to be drawn to   more expensive products  . In 2018, luxury goods consumption in China increased    7% year on year , accounting for 42% of the total global luxury goods market. Interestingly, 56% came from Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities.  
  In India,   luxury spending in second-tier cities was    30 times bigger    than in first-tier cities   in 2018.   The share of luxury retail spend in cities such as Chandigarh, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, and Udaipur rose   from 9% to 59% between 2013 and 2018.   
  Indonesia, one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the world, is predicted to have a consuming class of  170 million  by 2030, up from 85 million this year.  
 
   ﻿   
 
  Quality of life  
  Most fresh   graduates and professionals in China are going to   second-tier cities to work. This is because the dense population, traffic congestion, smog, and surging property prices are driving them away from first-tier cities.  
  This behavior has given cities near Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen an opportunity to grow and attract high-quality talent. The government’s decision to ease   hukou  , or the country’s residency policy, is also working well, especially for  new graduates .  
  The same trend   can also be observed in other countries. A survey by   Economic Times   in India found that 65% of its 2,272 respondents wanted to move out from first-tier cities and settle instead in second- or third-tier cities in the next five years. Meanwhile, 26% said they’d do so as soon as they get a good job.  
  People are attracted to lower-tier cities largely because of the   bigger living spaces available, less pollution, better-quality education for their children, and proximity to   their families. Properties in these cities are also perceived as  good retirement investments  by millennials.  
  The challenges  
  Even though second-tier cities promise massive growth in many aspects, some underlying problems still remain. According to the   Economic Times   survey, one of the key reasons why people in India wanted to shift out of first-tier cities is the high level of pollution. Ironically, second-tier cities Ghaziabad, and Noida are on the list of top 10 most polluted cities in the world.  
    
     
  This is also true for   many countries across Asia, such as Indonesia, where factors like industrial waste and forest fire aggravate pollution.  
  In China, the government   has been working to tackle this problem, but  98%  of its urban areas still exceed the World Health Organization’s guidelines on the amount of particulate pollution in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, 53% go beyond China’s less stringent national targets.  
  Unresolved traffic congestion in many Tier 2 cities as well as   unique socio-economic, geographic, and cultural factors are also some of the challenges that entrepreneurs and investors   need to pay extra attention to.  
 
   ﻿  ﻿  ﻿   
 
  What does it mean for startups?  
  Second-tier   cities, especially those that have yet to address some underlying problems, give startups room to innovate. The rising number of young graduates who have studied and are willing to work in these cities also provide a talent pool that fully understands a city’s unique characteristics and local needs.  
  Read:    These startups could unlock ecommerce’s true potential in Indonesia   
  Let’s take  PrivyID    as an example. The digital signature startup is based in Jakarta, but it chose to open a research and development center in Yogyakarta. The city is home to many well-known universities that can offer quality talent. It’s also more cost-efficient compared to Jakarta.  
  Similarly  , Indonesian ecommerce giant Bukalapak also set up its   research and development center in a Tier 2 city, Bandung. Meanwhile, local social commerce app   Super  is giving opportunities to locals in lower-tiered cities by empowering them to become reseller agents.  
  Moreover, i  nvestors are actively looking   for opportunities beyond first-tier markets.  Unicorn India Ventures , a Mumbai-based early-stage venture capital fund, deliberately scouted for startups in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities such as Jaipur, Pune, Trivandrum, and Cochin. In these locations, startups are building some unique solutions to solve very specific problems.   
  Governments   are also starting to realize the potential of second- and lower-tier cities and are rolling out initiatives to help startups in these markets.  
 WHY IT MATTERS 
  Understanding city tier systems can help not only companies but also founders and investors focus   their best resources on   the right opportunities. Startups from Tier 1 cities usually look for hot sectors and solve common problems, while startups in lower-tier cities tend to build unique products to solve specific problems.  
 F ounders who go for second- or lower-tier cities may find less competition in those places and   unlock opportunities in emerging sectors to become early players and win the market.  
  Lower   labor costs and the presence of reputable local universities that produce good talent are also encouraging signs. Vivid startup communities, future modern infrastructure that connects major cities, increasing consumer spending power, and capital flow for early-stage startups are promising as well.  
  But while   opportunities abound in lower-tier cities, anyone who wants to invest must do their homework first: understand specific government regulations, the cultural nuances, and local market needs.  
 As the saying goes, “Fortune favors the bold.”

 “The management changes will place us on an even stronger footing to strive for the next level,” said Huang, adding that he will be “closely involved in working with the board and management to formulate the company’s longer-term strategy.” 
 Chen is one of the founding members of Pinduoduo and has served as its CTO since 2016. Prior to joining the company, he served in the same role for gaming startup Xinyoudi Studio. 
 “I am honored and humbled to take on the role of CEO of Pinduoduo and look forward to working with the rest of our management team and colleagues to make Pinduoduo an even better corporate citizen and contribute more to society,” the new chief exec said. 
 In addition to Chen’s appointment, Pinduoduo also named Jianchong Zhu as general counsel and Jing Ma as vice president of finance. 
 Before taking on their new roles, Zhu served as the company’s senior vice president since 2018, while Ma had 17 years of finance-related experience in luxury brand Chanel. 
 The recent appointments follow Pinduoduo’s achievement in June of hitting  US$100 billion  in market capitalization, after posting positive results for the first quarter of the year. 
 In May, Pinduoduo recorded US$923.8 million in revenue for Q1 2020, up by 44% from the US$642 million it reported in the same quarter last year. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(2, 0.9994914)]","['CTO', 'Chanel']",['Pinduoduo']
651108,Luckin Coffee confirms $300m in fabricated revenue," According to Chinese coffee chain  Luckin Coffee , an internal probe found that the company’s net revenue in 2019 had been inflated by 2.1 billion yuan (US$300 million). 
 The investigation, which is “substantially” complete, also found that costs and expenses were inflated by 1.3 billion yuan (US$190 million) last year.

 The fabrication of transactions began in April 2019, according to a statement. 
 “In the course of the internal investigation, the special committee and its advisors reviewed over 550,000 documents collected from over 60 custodians, interviewed over 60 witnesses, and performed extensive forensic accounting and data analytics testing,” the company said. 
 Luckin, a major rival to global coffee chain Starbucks in China, said evidence to date revealed the participation of former CEO Jenny Qian and former chief operating officer Jian Liu, along with some employees reporting to them, in the fabrication. The funds involved in the fraudulent transactions were funneled to the company through “a number of third parties” associated with Luckin’s employees and/or related parties. 
 Following the findings, the company said its board of directors has terminated Qian and Liu and proposed to require Charles Lu to resign as board director and chairman. A meeting will be held today to consider the proposal. 
 In addition, 12 other employees related to the fabricated transactions, including those who were previously suspended, will be terminated. Meanwhile, some 15 employees will face disciplinary action. Luckin is also in the process of terminating relationships with all third parties involved in the fabricated transactions. 
 According to the coffee chain, the special committee may perform additional investigation if new relevant information comes up. 
 Last week, Luckin said it would file for delisting from Nasdaq, after receiving two delisting notices from the exchange and withdrawing its request for a hearing.

651090,Examining GudangAda’s unprecedented numbers,"  Updated on July 21 with clarifications.  
 Within just a few months,  GudangAda  has skyrocketed to become  one of the most well-funded tech startups  in Indonesia. After raising US$10.5 million in seed funding in February, the company raised US$25.4 million in a series A round held three months later from prominent investors such as Sequoia India, Pavilion Capital, Alpha JWC Ventures, and Wavemaker Partners. 
 The company hopes to make it easier for wholesalers and retailers in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry to buy and sell from one another. Through its app, which resembles online marketplaces Tokopedia and Shopee, users can transact, pay, and get their goods delivered, either through the sellers’ or GudangAda’s couriers.

 The company is making some bold claims. Despite starting only at the end of 2018, it says it has already processed US$1 billion in transactions in the past 12 months, even as the Covid-19 pandemic swept the country. It charges 0.5% to 2% commission for each transaction, which means a potential annual revenue of US$20 million. 
 It also tells  Tech in Asia  that it has acquired 80,000 big retailers and almost all of the FMCG wholesalers – around 20,000 of them – in Indonesia. The startup has repeated the claim to various media outlets, stating in an emailed press release that it has “nearly full market coverage of the nation’s FMCG wholesalers.” 
 And investors are convinced by the stunning growth that GudangAda is touting. “Look at the number of wholesalers and retailers already on the platform. Look at the amount of GMV they process. Look at how little time they took to get here. Nobody even comes close. That’s why it’s so hard to replicate,” says Paul Santos, managing partner of Wavemaker Partners. 
    
 However, a GudangAda business development executive tasked with acquiring wholesalers and big retailers in a third-tier city in Indonesia tells  Tech in Asia  on the condition of anonymity that his team has acquired only less than half of the wholesalers in his area. “There are still many stores that we have to onboard,” he says. 
  We also approached the owners or senior employees of 8 big retailers and 5 wholesalers in some parts of the Greater Jakarta Area’s FMCG sector. None of them have used the app and 10 of them haven’t heard of it.   
   Tech in Asia    reached out to GudangAda multiple times for this story, which took close to a month to complete. Following an hour-long phone interview and two follow-up queries totaling over 25 questions (which we received answers for), we sent another list of questions, this time focusing on the feedback we received from employees and wholesalers.  
  GudangAda declined to participate further due to the sensitive nature of some of its data, instead saying that the 20,000 figure it has touted refers to the number of “verified registered merchants”.   
  After the story was published, a company spokesperson further disputed our results.   
  He questioned    Tech in Asia’s    definitions of wholesalers and retailers, which may not be in line with GudangAda’s, and challenged the seniority of the people we spoke to and whether they truly know about the real situation.  
  He added that, based on the geographical scope and sample size of the merchants that we talked to, the results do not amount to a representative view.  
  Finally, the spokesperson said that GudangAda’s numbers have undergone due diligence by a Big Four accounting firm and were verified by prominent global investors.  
  Two businesses that  Tech in Asia  spoke to know of peers that use the startup’s services, while another wholesaler admits to being approached by a GudangAda salesperson. Industry players say there often isn’t a distinction between retailers and wholesalers; merchants typically serve both businesses and consumers.  
 Wavemaker Partners declines to give exact figures but says that “majority of GudangAda’s merchants are active monthly.” 
 The company’s gross merchandise volume (GMV) figure also seems extraordinary. Here’s  Tech in Asia’s  benchmark of GudangAda’s achievement against other B2B marketplaces: 
    
 Based on these numbers, GudangAda appears to be over 14x more capital-efficient than its peers. How exactly did it achieve this? Did it rely on transactions from a handful of large players to hit the number? 
 In response, Wavemaker Partners says that the company has set and achieved a goal of reaching 15,000 FMCG wholesalers, and that was the key to hitting US$1 billion in GMV. 
 “It’s also a dynamic business where the target moves, and we find ourselves discovering new wholesalers all the time. When we do, we try to bring them onboard too,” the VC says in a statement. 
 GudangAda itself refuses to discuss how it achieved the metrics, except to say that it defines GMV as “all transactions that have occurred on its platform”;  Tech in Asia,  however, is unable to independently verify its claims. 
 The company adds that it did not feel any negative impact from the pandemic. People still need to buy FMCG products, and there have been no restrictions on product movement in the country so far. 
 “For any interested parties, whether for investment or partnership, we can always open data access for verification after signing of NDA,” it says in a statement. 
 Connection with “old money” 
 Investors appear to be putting their trust in GudangAda. According to Wavemaker Partners’ Santos, the biggest driver of the startup’s growth is founder Stevensang’s experience, as he is a “trusted member” of the FMCG distribution ecosystem who has come up with a solution that addresses industry-wide challenges. 
 Stevensang (he goes by one name) is a FMCG business executive who has had more than 25 years of experience in the sector. Before retiring in 2017, he was the CEO of PT. Arta Boga Cemerlang, the sole distributor for the Orang Tua Group, which is owned by Husain Djojonegoro, the 19th richest person in Indonesia. The group mainly produces FMCG products such as wafers, biscuits, candies, and batteries, among others. 
 This connection to “old money” puts Stevensang in a unique position. “In my past experience, I did a lot of business trips and met many big players, wholesalers, and big retailers. I got their contacts from those activities,” the founder tells  Tech in Asia . 
 He started the company near the end of 2018 with his own money, plus funding from other founders whom he prefers not to disclose. During GudangAda’s first year, he tried to re-establish his relationships with merchants by doing a “tour” across the country. 
   
 Stevensang is also well-connected to FMCG executives, many of whom were his “former subordinates,” he says. 
 This is why many of GudangAda’s employees came from PT. Arta Boga Cemerlang and the Orang Tua Group, including its head of operations and chief of business development, and even those in positions such as area sales manager and team supervisor. 
 “I didn’t ask them to join me, but they just came to me and requested to join,” Stevensang explains. Today, the company has around 350 employees who mostly work in tech and marketing. 
 Improving a manual process 
 FMCG wholesalers and retailers have long been relying on salespeople going door to door to buy or sell products. Even though their salaries have been increasing, “their productivity has been declining. It lowers the merchants’ profit,” Stevensang says. 
 GudangAda is trying to replace them with an app that pools buyers and sellers, along with their products. Launched in January 2019, its goal is to make B2B transactions more efficient: Retailers can find any product through the app rather than reaching out to different wholesalers, and a wholesaler can also stock up by buying products from other wholesalers. 
 According to Jianggan Li, founder of venture builder Momentum Works, GudangAda’s success depends on its ability to cut transaction and operational costs for both wholesalers and retailers. 
 He adds that B2B platforms in the past have been too focused on simply matching buyers and sellers. In contrast, since it has started to onboard wholesalers and big retailers to its app, GudangAda is taking a more hands-on approach by deploying its own salesforce. 
 The same approach has been used by B2B ecommerce startups such as  Growsari  in the Philippines, which has hired salespeople to visit stores and engage their owners, with the ultimate goal of encouraging them to register on the platform and place orders through it on a regular basis. 
 Former and current employees tell  Tech in Asia  that GudangAda generally has two kinds of salespeople: Those who roam their assigned areas and approach wholesalers and big retailers from door to door, and those who stay in a wholesaler’s store and approach buyers who drop by. 
 GudangAda focuses on acquiring wholesalers first as that allows the company to quickly access the entire supply chain. “It acquires the largest wholesalers, who then acquire the next level of wholesalers, and so on. And ultimately, the wholesalers are now acquiring the retailers,” says Abheek Anand, managing director of Sequoia India, a GudangAda investor. 
   
 While GudangAda is still focusing on wholesalers and big retailers, it’s starting to allow manufacturers to list their products directly on the app. To maintain trade fairness in the platform, the company has limited its users only to those who actually have an FMCG business; one of its salesforce’s tasks is to verify whether a store is real or not. 
 Everyone can download the app, but one has to put in a code provided by a GudangAda salesperson to register. “We have to do it to prevent speculators who want to buy products at a cheaper price and sell them at abnormal prices,” Stevensang says. 
 Matching buyers and sellers is just the first step. GudangAda has also developed a logistics service that will deliver goods from the sellers’ stores to the buyers. However, it is still in the early stages. A company salesperson assigned to a third-tier city in Indonesia says that the service hasn’t been launched yet in some areas, though she is aware that it is already operating in a second-tier city. 
 In the near future, the company plans to provide financing products to merchants and a subscription-based software as a service (SaaS) product that can help retailers manage inventory and financial statements. 
 Stevensang emphasizes that GudangAda is an independent company and isn’t owned by his former employer, the Orang Tua Group. To avoid conflict of interest, he doesn’t want any manufacturers or principals to become investors in his company. 
 He adds that big FMCG manufacturers in Indonesia such as Mayora, Wings, Gudang Garam, Orang Tua, and Indofood have their own supply chains, which are exclusive to their products. Thus, any investment from them will create the assumption that GudangAda’s platform will prioritize certain products over others. 
 Obstacles remain 
 As the fourth largest country in the world by population, Indonesia is a big market for FMCG products. According to Wavemaker Partners’ Santos, the market is valued at over US$50 billion, with an annual growth of 8%. 
    
 The biggest challenge for the company is getting big distributors to switch to digital ordering methods fast enough. And according to Hadi Kuncoro, the CEO of Power Commerce who has experience in both conventional and ecommerce supply chains, that change will take some time. 
 “Startups who can succeed in this industry are the ones who have long runways that allow them to wait for the change to happen. Otherwise, they have to tap into a more profitable business, such as sourcing products from manufacturers and selling them directly to retailers,” Kuncoro says. 
 Existing and former employees of GudangAda tell  Tech in Asia  that they face difficulties in onboarding customers. One of the main reasons for the customers’ hesitancy is that GudangAda’s only payment option currently is through bank transfer. Most customers prefer to pay in cash upon delivery or when they go to the stores themselves to pick up the goods, especially since the company doesn’t provide delivery service in most of the markets it serves. 
 Another issue is that merchants often resort to making transactions on a personal basis in order to avoid paying tax. They’re afraid that buying or selling on GudangAda would mean officially transacting as a business – which would put them under government scrutiny. 
 A wholesaler who has heard about GudangAda says that he would consider using the app if the price and tax treatments are good. “Our problem is [having] a big GMV but a small margin. We don’t want to use a bank account, only cash, because we don’t want the tax office to detect our transactions. Our margin is around 5% to 12%, so a 10% tax is quite big for us,” he explains. 
 Working with incumbents, not against them 
 Stevensang is aware of the merchants’ doubts, but he says that they are open to solutions as long as GudangAda doesn’t disrupt, bypass, or eliminate the traditional supply chain. Unlike other B2B ecommerce startups, GudangAda isn’t doing an end-to-end service; instead, it’s looking to make existing players in the supply chain more efficient. 
 He also points out the fact that most owners of wholesale and retail businesses are handing them over to the more tech-savvy second generation. 
 GudangAda employees say that some store owners are willing to try the app because of its similarity to popular B2C marketplaces Tokopedia and Shopee.

 Ultimately, the startup’s approach of marrying a marketplace with logistics and financial services is similar to Udaan’s, which also runs a B2B ecommerce marketplace and was once crowned “ India’s fastest unicorn .” The company started by facilitating transactions between merchants before expanding into logistics and loans. 
 Stevensang admits there are several things that he has picked up from Udaan, such as successful fundraising measures, fast scaling and execution, and launching a logistics arm early; the latter is crucial because according to an ex-employee, sellers are typically too busy to deliver the products themselves, and this makes buyers hesitant to place orders. 
 The founder adds, “However, there are also parts that we have to avoid, such as high cash burn, not charging for too long, unfocused categories expansion [that are] only retracted later, and rushing into lending with huge nonperforming loan (NPL) losses.” GudangAda is also saving cost by not providing warehousing. Instead, it assists sellers in sending their items directly to buyers. 
 Stevensang declines to reveal the company’s runway, but says that it will fundraise again toward the end of the year or next year.

650935,Robotics startup Botsync raises seed funding to automate supply chains,"  Botsync , a startup providing heavy-duty autonomous mobile robot solutions, said it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding to extend its offerings to the logistics and manufacturing sectors. 
 
  From left: Botsync founders Singaram Venkatachalam, Prashant Trivedi, Nikhil Venkatesh, and Rahul Nambiar / Photo credit: Botsync 
 
 The round was led by engineering services firm Wong Fong Industries, Seeds Capital, startup investment platform Angelhub, and alternative investments company Artesian Venture Partners. Early backers of the startup include Brinc and Nanyang Technological University’s Ecolabs Center of Innovation. 
 Botsync, which is based in Singapore, builds mobile robots that can transport payloads of 30 kilograms to 1,000 kilograms, reducing dependency on forklifts or manual labor. The company said its solutions are easy to deploy, as they only require minimal or no changes to a client’s existing infrastructure. 
 With the fresh funds, the startup aims to build out its tech teams and accelerate product development. 
  What problem is it solving?  Prashant Trivedi, the startup’s sales chief, told  Tech in Asia  that labor shortage and the rising costs of employment are making it difficult for logistics and manufacturing companies to meet growing consumer demand. This problem has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, highlighting a deeper need for solutions that can streamline supply chain operations. 
 For that reason, Botsync designed its robots to automate simple and repetitive tasks, such as moving heavy goods from point to point so humans can focus on more value-adding activities. It claims its solutions can help clients slash about 45% of their operational costs. 
 Aside from building robots, the startup also runs a training arm, Botsync Labs, to equip the workforce and students with robotics and related tech skills. 
 With the Covid-19 pandemic, Botsync has also started offering free consultation and flexible rental-based deployments to help companies make up for a reduced workforce and meet sanitation requirements. 
  What’s the opportunity?  According to a 2020 Market Study report, the global autonomous mobile robots market is expected to grow to US$600 million by the end of 2025, up from just US$180 million in 2017. 
 To capture its fair share of the market, Botsync plans to validate its product’s reliability and safety through two major pilots this year. “This will put us in a position to successfully commercialize the products from the start of 2021,” said Rahul Nambiar, Botsync’s CEO and co-founder. 
 The startup’s primary go-to-market strategy is to leverage its partners and build integrations with their automation tools. With this, the company will be able to rapidly implement its technology, starting from the sites of its existing partners, which currently include Wong Fong and software company SAP. 
 “For revenue generation, we have both a capital expenditure- and operating expenditure-type pricing model for the hardware, depending on the use cases of the customers. In addition, we will have a subscription-based pricing for certain software services,” Nambiar said. 
  What are its challenges?  The company considers the cost and integration of its tech to be the biggest roadblocks for customers. 
 “Businesses still find it difficult to set aside large upfront capital investments for automation. This is why we also consider operational investment models for companies to make adoption easier,” said Trivedi. 
  How much traction is it targeting?  With two pilots underway, the company said it’s on track to deploy around 10 to 15 robots by the end of the year. Singapore will be the startup’s principal target for 2020, Nambiar said. 
 Beyond that, the company will look to expand in the region, especially in Southeast Asia and India. “In this geography, we will mostly be targeting distribution centers, third-party logistics sites, and intralogistics operations in manufacturing facilities,” said the chief exec. 
  Who are the team members?  In 2017, Nambiar and Trivedi built Botsync together with the startup’s chief operating officer Singaram Venkatachalam and chief technology officer Nikhil Venkatesh. They are all graduates of Nanyang Technological University, where they were involved in building robotic projects for two years. 
 Together, they have a background in mechanical and electrical engineering and computer science. 
 Botsync now has 16 team members across two offices in Bangalore and Singapore. ",Miguel Cordon,0,3,"[(2, 0.99979293)]","['SAP', 'Nambiar', 'Trivedi']","['Brinc', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'Bangalore', 'India']"
650784,Wavemaker backs industrial tech startup Ackcio in pre-series A round,"  Ackcio , a startup that builds wireless monitoring solutions for industrial projects, has raised an undisclosed amount of funding in a round co-led by Wavemaker Partners and Michael Gryseels, president of digital enabler True Digital Group. 
 The round was joined by existing investors Seeds Capital, AccelerAsia Ventures, Aletra Capital Partners, Foundamental, and Entrepreneur First, according to a statement.

 Founded in 2016, the Singapore-based Ackcio looks to automate monitoring processes in development sites. Its solutions can be applied to various industries such as construction and mining to monitor a project’s structural integrity and ensure safety, among other things. 
 Its flagship product Ackcio Beam receives data from Ackcio’s nodes and uploads them to the cloud or third-party servers. Users can then oversee the data and make informed decisions via Ackcio’s dashboard and app. 
 The startup plans to use the new funds to expand its presence in its existing markets in the coming months, co-founder and CEO Nimantha Baranasuriya told  Tech in Asia . The chief exec also said that Ackcio will be investing in support services for its growing user base as well as in sales and marketing to enter new markets. 
  What problem is it solving?  Baranasuriya said that geotechnical stability is crucial to infrastructure, construction, and mining projects. “Failures like tunnel collapses or dam breaches are of the highest material risk category for such projects. Accidents can result in multiple fatalities, environmental damages, massive financial losses, and extended project delays.” 
 Baranasuriya also said that he sees limited product development, improvement, and innovation in the geotechnical monitoring space, resulting in the use of dated and ineffective systems. 
 This has led the company to build a simple solution that streamlines the monitoring process. Ackcio Beam can also be easily integrated into a site’s current operations, as it’s compatible with commonly used sensors. 
  What’s the opportunity?  According to a recent Markets and Markets report, the geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring market is expected to grow from US$3.3 billion last year to US$5 billion by 2024. 
 Ackcio looks to get a bigger slice of the pie by expanding worldwide. For now, it has partnered with key industry players in the geotechnical space to drive the adoption of its technology. 
 In the future, it plans to move into other industrial instrumentation and monitoring systems for other industries so it can serve a broader market. 
 Moreover, the startup noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has left many construction and mining sites around the world with less manpower, driving the adoption of automated solutions. 
 “In post-pandemic times, we are seeing a sticky increase in demand for our technology, which allows contractors to monitor their projects in real time without depending on manpower availability,” said Baranasuriya. 
  What are its challenges?  Baranasuriya said that given the critical nature of the industry, construction and mining projects are very harsh environments. 
 “Most countries have regulatory frameworks governing the monitoring of geotechnical and structural sensors, since the data from these sensors are used to manage risks. So the sensor data needs to be reliably collected and delivered to the stakeholders for them to take timely and well-informed decisions.” 
 Baranasuriya shared that to get a foothold in the industry, Ackcio invested heavily in research and development to make sure its solutions are reliable. 
  How much traction is it targeting?  Ackcio currently serves clients globally, with a presence in over 15 countries in Southeast Asia, China, Oceania, Europe, and North America. Its equipment has been used in projects such as the Thomson-East Coast MRT line, the Bedok Canal expansion, and one at the Changi Airport in Singapore. 
 It recently opened a sales office in Canada to enter the North and South American markets. 
 While the company declined to disclose its revenue and user targets, its CEO said that Ackcio aims to penetrate all continents by the end of 2020. 
  Who are the team members?  Baranasuriya obtained his doctorate in wireless networking from the National University of Singapore. He previously worked as an associate tech lead for Sri Lankan software product engineering company 99X Technology. 
 He co-founded Ackcio with Mobashir Mohammad, who serves as the startup’s chief technology officer. Mobashir holds a doctorate in internet of things and wireless networking from the National University of Singapore.

651042,Entrepreneurship runs deep in the Chearavanont family,"  Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can  sign up here .   
 
 Hello readers 
 Happy hump day! Ever wonder what kind of startup would catch a billionaire’s eye? Scroll down to find out. 😉 But first… 
  Your quick bytes for today:  
 🚶‍♂️ Another high-ranking individual has left his post. This time, it’s Mark Porter,  Grab’s CTO  for its core technologies and transport business. 
 🎥 Believe us when we say that livestream ecommerce is huge – our explanation for this was in yesterday’s email if you missed it. The industry is so large that China is  going to start regulating  it. 
 🍔 In other news on regulations: Thailand will begin   implementing measures to regulate  the online and food delivery services in the country. 
 🎤 You can now sing along to Queen’s  Don’t Stop Me Now , as Spotify has released a  new lyrics feature  in Southeast Asia and India. 
 💳 Food delivery startup Swiggy enters the fintech sphere as it launched its own  digital wallet , Swiggy Money, in partnership with ICICI Bank. 
 👀 Facebook’s new  Avatars feature  in India is a customizable sticker creator that looks a lot like Snapchat’s Bitmoji. 
 The heir to a Thai billionaire family made an acquisition 
   
The Chearavanont family are real-life crazy rich Asians – they own Thai conglomerate CP Group and are ranked third on Bloomberg’s Asia’s richest family list in 2019. 
 The grandson of the family, Korawad Chearavanont, is a techie at heart. He’s the co-founder of Thai work collaboration app Eko, which recently acquired local AI chatbot firm ConvoLab for an eight-figure sum and  launched a new parent  company called Amity. 
  Amity is booming  
Amity (previously known as Eko) is similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams. And like many remote working tools, it’s seeing huge growth during the pandemic. 
 The company’s revenue saw a  200% increase  in the second quarter of this year as hotels, hospitals, and cleaning firms jumped onboard its platform. 
 Currently, Amity has 5 million active users and has managed to break even for the first time in its eight years of operation. 
  Why chatbot?  
Founded in 2016, ConvoLab uses natural language processing to help its clients engage with their customers. 
 Amity plans to invest heavily in AI and work automation and believes that chatbots will be one of the main mediums in which AI will be able to assist humans in the workplace. 
 Following the acquisition, Korawad is now the CEO of Amity – which operates in Bangkok, London, Austin, and Milan. In the future, the firm is looking to invest further in its products and growth. 
 Entrepreneurship runs deep in the Chearavanont family 
   
Korawad’s father, Suphachai Chearavanont, has a tech vision for CP Group, a firm that’s almost a century old with over 310,000 employees and US$63 billion in revenue in 2018. It’s a huge firm that runs 14 business units across agriculture, retail, ecommerce, media, real estate, automotive, pharmaceuticals, and financial services. 
 One of its innovations is TrueID, a “ content super app  (🔒)” that allows users to stream both video and music content. Launched four years ago, it’s a competitor of  Tencent’s Joox  and  WeTV  (🔒) services. 
 Synergies run deep within CP Group’s businesses. For instance, its payments platform TrueMoney, a part of CP Group subsidiary Ascend Group, powers payments on the TrueID platform. 7-Eleven outlets in Thailand, which are run by the group’s retail arm – CP All – serve as a convenient touchpoint where customers can access e-payment services as well. 
 It’s OK if you’re still clueless about CP Group. But if you live in Southeast Asia, it’s very likely that you’re using or consuming one of its products, and  this is  one of my favorites. 
 Contactless payment for school fees in Indonesia 
   
Don’t be surprised when you see a long line of students at schools’ admin offices during lunchtime in Indonesia: They’re just paying their school fees. 
 The current payment process in most schools in the archipelago is still very manual, cash-based, and paper-based. 
 Indonesian startup InfraDigital wants to help schools by digitizing their student data, automating back-office processes, and facilitating online tuition payments. And the company just raised an  undisclosed amount  of series A funding from Taiwan-based AppWorks to do so. 
  Back to school  
Over 300 educational institutions across 12 provinces in Indonesia are using InfraDigital, which serves more than 140,000 students. 
 The company, which counts Gojek, Tokopedia, LinkAja, Alfamart, Ayopop, and Indomaret as partners, claims that its solutions have helped some schools increase their income by up to 16%. In 2018 the startup reported a total transaction value of US$2.1 million. 
 One of its offerings, Jaringan IDN, makes student enrollment, invoicing, and payments collection easier for schools. 
 In the future, InfraDigital plans to use the new capital to develop more school management services and expand into other provinces across Indonesia.

650919,Shared powerbanks: A billion-dollar opportunity or fool’s gold?,"  This story is a joint effort by Stefanie Yeo, Nicole Jao, Willis Wee, Maria Li, and Terence Lee.  
 The best startup ideas often sound stupid. Even Y Combinator founder Paul Graham was wrong about Facebook. “One of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded to me when I first heard about it. A site for college students to waste time? It seemed the perfect bad idea,” he  recalled  in a post. 
 A powerbank rental service probably belongs in that category: It’s either a brilliant or foolish idea. For a while, people were heaping scorn on it, with a son of a Chinese billionaire even  promising  to eat poop if the idea ever took off. 
 He’s since deleted the social media post where he made that declaration, and it’s a good thing he did. The shared powerbank sector in China is now a US$1.1 billion market, and the devices have become  commonplace  in malls and restaurants all over the country. Even Meituan-Dianping, which bowed out of the space some years ago, is jumping back in. 
   
 But will this be a lucrative opportunity in Southeast Asia as well? Does it make sense from a financial standpoint? 
 In this report,  Tech in Asia  explores in detail the pain point that the model is solving as well as its unit economics and market opportunity. We believe there’s more to it than meets the eye. 
 Why do shared powerbanks matter? 
 We can all relate to the problem of having our smartphones run out of juice. To prevent this from happening, we carry around powerbanks, cables, and wall chargers – sometimes all at once – to ensure that we’re never caught unawares. 
 That being said, poor battery life is still a reality because batteries have not changed much since the days of the Nokia 3310, which was launched in 2000. Even as our phones have gotten smarter and faster, what powers them has remained largely the same. 
 Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and typically used in consumer electronics, will continue to power most of our devices. Mahdokht Shaibani, a research fellow at the Monash University’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, believes that in the next five to 10 years, “we will continue seeing lithium-ion batteries in portable electronics such as smartphones.” 
 Shaibani is just one of the many researchers looking to unearth the next stage of battery tech. But even though there has been  a lot of work done  in the field, it’s unlikely that a huge breakthrough will come to the market in the near future. And with the advent of 5G networks, which  consume more power  than 4G, any advancements on battery life could be canceled out, anyway. 
 As such, we probably won’t be leaving the powerbanks and charging cables at home anytime soon. 
 On the surface, shared powerbanks don’t make sense – after all, the devices are relatively inexpensive, and you likely have several lying around at home already. 
 But with the sharing model, people don’t have to worry about charging their powerbanks and carrying them around – they can just pick one up from a charging station whenever the need arises and drop them off at another station when they’re done with it. 
 “Every week, I probably use it three or four times,” an MBA student in Shanghai tells  Tech in Asia . Powerbank-sharing is “miraculously convenient and easy to use” in China, he continues. 
 Rise of shared powerbanks in China 
 Shared powerbanks started popping up in China in 2016, riding the wave of the sharing economy boom. With the rush of funding for startups in the space, charging stations became ubiquitous in busy commercial and business areas. 
 At the height of the trend in 2017, Chinese media reported that venture capital firms  poured  an estimated US$170 million into powerbank-sharing businesses within a 40-day period. 
 Starting from recreational and food and beverage (F&amp;B) establishments, including restaurants, movie theaters, and karaoke bars, powerbank-sharing quickly expanded into public spaces like train stations and airports across China. 
 However, stiff competition in the market triggered a price war, which subsequently shifted the landscape. Smaller operators pulled out, leaving only four surviving players: Monster Energy, Xiaodian, Jiedian, and Laidian. 
    
 
 
    
 After that, the powerbank-sharing hype in China ebbed and growth slowed. Still, according to a  report  by Trustdata in 2019, there are now more than 2 million high-frequency users who rent a powerbank at least once a week on average. 
 And there is still room for growth. Transaction volumes are  estimated  to reach US$2.1 billion in 2020, up from US$1.1 billion in 2019. Similarly, the sector’s user base is projected to reach 408 million, up from 305 million in 2019. 
 Recently, the industry has once again attracted the attention of Chinese tech giants like Meituan, which announced its  reentry  into the space in August last year. The food delivery platform forayed into powerbank sharing in 2017 but decided to pull out after less than three months, citing a “lack of synergy with other businesses.” 
  User experience  
 In China, the entire user flow – from signing up for and using a shared powerbank – is seamless and can be completed within apps like Alipay or WeChat. 
 Users, however, need to have a valid Chinese mobile phone number in order to sign up. 
 Lightweight versions of powerbank-sharing apps (or mini programs) are also available inside Alipay and WeChat. 
 With the two apps, users can top up their powerbank account and pay for deposits – usually US$15 – which are required by some operators. Such payments can be a hassle as each competing brand would require a separate deposit. 
 However, operators have begun to  waive these fees  as long as users meet a certain credit score on Alipay or WeChat Pay’s credit scoring systems. This was a key driver of growth, according to industry watchers. 
 Despite forgoing deposits, a report shows that only  less than 1%  of users fail to return the devices they rent. 
 Powerbanks in China are typically free to use for the first 30 minutes, with charges of around 1 yuan to 3 yuan (US$0.14 to US$0.42) for every subsequent hour after that. Areas with high traffic, though, often command higher fees. 
 But regardless of the convenience that the service offers, there are still plenty of challenges for consumers. 
   
 A Beijing-based developer who works in the tech industry says he’s a heavy powerbank user and usually rents the portable devices from malls close to his workplace. He notes, however, that insufficient coverage and deployment of charging stations is an issue. “There was one time when I needed to return the powerbank, and every slot on the charging station I rented from was in use. By the time the mall was closing, I still couldn’t find a slot.” 
 Despite this, powerbank-sharing has reached  over 50% penetration  in places like restaurants, shopping malls, train stations, and airports in China. 
    
     
 On another occasion, the same developer says he had rented a powerbank before going to a movie with some friends. After exiting the cinema, he found that the entire mall was closed – including the powerbank charging station. 
 Similar frustrations include charging stations located in hard-to-find locations. “Once, I was at a shopping center and I ended up wasting a lot of time trying to find the charging station operated by the platform I rented from,” said a user, “It can be quite frustrating.” 
  How they make money  
 At present, powerbank-sharing platforms get around 97.2% of their revenue from the rental fees collected from consumers, according to  an analysis  by consumer insights firm iResearch. 
 Though operators have been seeking other sources of revenue, such as ads, the business is still nascent. 
 Powerbank-sharing companies in China currently use a mixture of three approaches: the direct sales model, the service provider model, and the franchise model. 
   ﻿   
 IResearch adds that of the four largest powerbank-sharing platforms in China, the direct sales model accounts for the largest portion of income from rental fees (72%). The service provider model and the franchise model account for 19.3% and 8.7%, respectively. 
 Powerbank sharing in the rest of Asia 
 By addressing a universal problem, powerbank sharing has expanded beyond China’s borders. Here’s a look at the key players in other markets: 
    
 Regardless of its presence in many cities, the service is still nascent and relatively unknown outside of China – especially in Southeast Asia. 
 “No one knows about it, just like ride-hailing a few years back,” explains Dylan Wong, CEO of powerbank rental firm Rush. In his view, educating consumers in the region about the existence of the service and how to use it is the first step businesses need to take. 
 The friction in the sign-up process is also a major hurdle. Unlike China, where the ubiquity of WeChat and Alipay and their associated credit scoring systems streamline the registration process, onboarding users is much more troublesome in areas like Southeast Asia. 
 There are no centralized credit scoring databases in the region, which means users need to pay deposits first before accessing the service. 
 
  Typical user flow outside of China 
 
 
  Typical user flow in China 
 
 Furthermore, China’s powerbank-sharing companies benefit from the ease of cashless payment options like WeChat Pay and AliPay. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia has a large unbanked population, and e-wallet usage is still in the early stages – another barrier to powerbank sharing taking off in the region. 
 User response to powerbank sharing in Southeast Asia has so far been mixed. Common complaints, as seen via app store reviews, include gripes about the app not registering a returned powerbank, getting faulty devices, and charging stations not being reflected accurately on in-app maps. 
 Unit economics 
  Tech in Asia  tested the financial fundamentals of the shared powerbank business model using data from Chinese industry reports and our own analysis and fine-tuned our calculations based on feedback from operators. To simplify things, we’ve assumed each powerbank rental is for one hour. 
  Cost  
 On a per unit basis, there are two primary cost categories associated with operating a shared powerbank business: 
 
 
 Hardware and logistics (60%)  – This involves the cost of procuring the actual powerbanks and getting them to the final in-store location across Southeast Asia. We’ve included end-to-end expenses, allocating 20% for replacement and maintenance and 15% toward disposal fees for units that have become unusable (considering we’re dealing with lithium-ion batteries, and there are likely to be regulations around their disposal). 
 
 Merchants and selling (40%)  – These are the operational expenses associated with running the business like the cost of renting merchant locations, business development fees to acquire new merchants, marketing expenditure for new users, and payment gateway fees. 
 
 We have explicitly excluded the cost of development and maintenance for the app itself. This is based on the assumption that the platform scales regardless of the number of powerbank units in the network and thus wouldn’t contribute to a company’s unit economics. 
  Revenue  
 This assumes a no-deposit model with an average US$0.30 per hour charging fee. 
  Break-even point  
 In order for a company to achieve break-even point in its first year of operations, each of its powerbanks would have to be rented out for 302 hours. 
 However, since most of the expenditures are absorbed at the beginning, the break-even point would be lower in subsequent years. 
 Considering most powerbanks advertise a lifetime of 500 cycles, the unit economics indicate that a profitable business model is possible. 
  Unit economics breakdown  
   
 To test our assumptions, we ran a few other scenarios: 
 
 
 Rental space costs:  Just like Meituan in China, a powerbank operator can significantly reduce costs if they’re able to negotiate free or reduced rental space charges from merchants in exchange for certain perks. Assuming a 75% reduction in the rental and marketing costs, this delivers a 25% improvement in the break-even point. 
 
 Payment gateway:  In the base case, we’ve assumed a 1% payment gateway fee, presuming that the company uses a local e-wallet such as GrabPay or GoPay. While these options are affordable, integration on the software backend remains a challenge. If a powerbank rental firm were to instead go with Stripe as their gateway, a microtransaction cost would be a lot higher (averaging US$0.10 per transaction + a 5% variable fee). With only US$0.30 revenue per hour, the payment gateway costs would eat into the unit economics, leaving razor-thin margins. 
 
 Supply chain:  Given that this is such an asset-heavy business, running a clean and efficient supply chain will be critical to success. Holding all else equal, if any operator could improve their supply chain costs by 10%, then they would see a 6.6% cost reduction at the unit economics level. 
 
  Unit economics: Scenario analyses  
   
 Market opportunity 
 Supposing that shared powerbank startups achieve 100% penetration – which essentially means there are charging stations installed in all possible point-of-sales (POS) channels – Southeast Asia would represent a US$658 million total addressable market. Here’s the total possible number of charging stations and powerbanks in circulation across Southeast Asia: 
    
 The table below summarizes the total addressable market (TAM): 
    
 In reality, it is impossible for shared powerbanks to hit full market penetration. So to understand what’s realistic in Southeast Asia, we took a look at China’s well-documented powerbank industry. 
 We believe the biggest driver for growth is capital, as it helps catalyze the industry’s network effects. For China to hit 29.14% user penetration, it took four years and US$363 million in venture capital funding. If Southeast Asia wants to achieve the same results, it would require US$170 million in funding. 
    
 That said, raising US$170 million is a tall order in this region. Instead, we’ll assume that the combined capital raise for Southeast Asia’s powerbank startups will hit US$50 million, giving a  lever ratio  computation of US$50 million / US$170 million. A lever ratio of 1 means that Southeast Asia will raise US$170 million and hit 29% penetration rate in four years. 
    
   ﻿   
 How we calculated market opportunity: 
 
 We worked backward to calculate the linear growth of powerbanks in circulation in each POS channel. In malls, for example, China hit 60% penetration in four years, so for Southeast Asia, the best result in the same timeframe is 273,600 x 60%. That’s 164,160 powerbanks in circulation across the region. 
 Assuming linear growth, Southeast Asia would add 41,040 powerbanks in malls each year. We repeated the first two steps for all POS channels. 
 The more capital the sector raises overall, the faster the growth. It took US$363 million of venture funding to achieve 29.14% user penetration in China, so if we prorate that to Southeast Asia’s population, it would take around US$170 million to achieve the same result. Realistically, if the total fundraise for the region’s shared powerbank startups in four years is US$50 million, then the growth in user penetration would be reduced by (1 – 50/170) = 0.706 or 70.5%. 
 
 Challenges 
 The challenges associated with scaling a powerbank business in Southeast Asia are numerous, especially in comparison with China’s experience. 
  Lack of a mature digital payments ecosystem  
 A critical factor that led to the rise of shared powerbanks in China was the ease of access to a unified and digitized financial system. This drove market adoption in three ways: 
 
 Chinese players could piggyback their efforts off fairly sophisticated fintech platforms like Ant Financial, which created a private credit scoring system called Sesame Credit. This gave powerbank operators a quick and easy way to assess their borrowers credit score and remove the need for deposits. 
 Digital transactions are increasingly the norm in China, and powerbank rental firms often allow users to pay via Alipay, WeChat Pay, and other e-wallets. This removes the friction stemming from having consumers key in user details and credit cards information into their apps. 
 Perhaps the most important difference is that the average Chinese user now relies on their smartphone and e-wallets for their daily transactions. Few people in China use cash or credit cards, and this very user behavior increases the demand for shared powerbanks. After all, running out of battery becomes a serious issue when it means you can’t pay for your daily transactions. 
 
 In contrast, the digital payment ecosystem in Southeast Asia is still nascent. This makes user acquisition for powerbank-sharing businesses tougher, as consumers have to pay either a deposit or verify their bank accounts first before using the service. It also means that the user behavior has yet to mature to the point where there is mass demand for such a product. 
 Another primary challenge: the fees associated with payment gateways. In China,  most transactions  on WeChat Pay and Alipay are free on the consumer side. On the merchant side, fees are around  0.6% . 
    
 “Transaction fees for [credit cards] in Southeast Asia is the biggest killer for small-transaction businesses like us,” says Jiarong Foo, CEO of PowerNow Asia. 
 There are ways around these costly fees, however. According to Alexander Foo, chief technology officer at powerbank rental service Wattah, such payment gateway charges are the reason why a number of powerbank-sharing operators have a wallet function in their apps. 
 “Many powerbank companies have a top-up credits functionality to increase transaction value and reduce the number of transactions and cost to payment gateways,” he explains. Such features allow users to top up in US$2, US$5, and US$10 denominations, for instance. 
  Asset-heavy model  
 Potential powerbank operators across Southeast Asia must be mindful of the operating costs of such an asset-heavy business. Additional logistics costs associated with shipping the hardware from China to the in-country port and the last-mile logistics from the port to the final in-store location can quickly add up. This is on top of charges like value-added taxes, customs, and duties for each country. 
 While regulations remain inconsistent across the region, it’s also important to know proper disposal techniques for powerbanks at end-of-life because they use lithium-ion batteries, which degrade over time. 
 In the world of consumer electronics, servicing can be a headache to deal with as well. Technical maintenance teams will have to be able to quickly and efficiently cover densely populated areas to conduct various installation, repairs, replacement, and disposal processes in charging stations in the area. This also assumes that the technical team is fairly well-trained to repair electronic components on-site. 
 Operationally, most companies would have to manage two teams in the same territory – one on the merchant acquisition side and one for servicing and technical issues. This can drive up labor costs, even more so in cities such as Jakarta or Manila, where heavy traffic can limit mobility. As such, individuals can only cover a smaller territory. The saving grace is that Southeast Asian cities are denser than their Chinese counterparts in terms of population density. 
    
 Chinese powerbank operators were able to bypass some of these business model challenges because of some advantages. Certainly, the concentration of powerbank suppliers in Shenzhen and Guangdong have reduced a lot of logistical costs. The country’s strong technical talent pool – thanks to years of electronics servicing even in tier 2 and tier 3 cities – was another major boon. 
  Existential threats  
 While most industry experts agree that there won’t be a revolution in battery technology in the next four to six years, there is always a risk that the major smartphone suppliers will adjust how their phones are charged, forcing a mass hardware refresh from powerbank operators. 
 If Southeast Asia’s powerbank market develops slowly and consumer adoption takes another two to three years to proliferate, it will leave a fairly small window for such startups to recoup spent capital and reach mass scale. 
 Furthermore, the impact of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdowns have led to a cratering of demand, as far more people stay at home. As with many other in-person products and services, powerbank businesses are at the mercy of potential repeat shutdowns and a general lack of travelers. 
 The effects of Covid-19 may persist even after the pandemic ends, as consumers might become more resistant to sharing items with strangers. Powerbank operators may need to include more hygiene-focused processes into their operations, which will add to their costs. 
 Prospects 
 Despite such stumbling blocks, there are a few interesting industry trends at play that could create a rosy outlook for powerbank-sharing firms in Southeast Asia. 
 To achieve better margins, bundling powerbank rentals with other, higher-margin services could be a recipe for success. This approach, which Meituan used to full effect in China, could help reduce merchant or user acquisition costs by allowing cross-promotion with other products and services. It could also create a stickier platform and reduce merchant and user churn. All of this may result in better gross margins on a per unit basis. 
 Meituan-like companies such as Grab and Gojek, which have large F&amp;B merchant networks, can benefit from this approach if they do choose to launch a shared powerbank service in the future.

 Alternatively, having an effective and seamless supply chain and service model is another way to drastically cut costs. Whether this means streamlining shipment costs or reducing the fees associated with installation, maintenance, and disposal, any operator will have to run a clean supply chain in the long run to win with such thin margins. 
 There are two macro trends that might fuel the rise of shared powerbanks: 
 
 
 The rise of e-wallets:  As we saw in China, a fairly digital financial system – from credit scoring to payment to usage – has a massive impact on obtaining product-market fit. 
 
 The rise of 5G:  Industry specialists have indicated that they expect 5G to consume up to 2.5x the amount of battery than 4G phones. If this turns out to be true, there could be significant shifts in user demand 
 
 Prospects for success at this point vary country by country. Early operators such as PowerNow have found some success in Malaysia, which offers a WeChat Pay function in ringgit. The other markets we’re keeping an eye on include: 
 
 
 Vietnam:  With a relatively strong local electronics capability, a healthy cross-border flow of electronic components with China, and a large domestic population, Vietnam can enjoy some of the relative competitive advantages seen in China. However, low e-wallet penetration and user education will provide continued headwinds. 
 
 Thailand and Indonesia:  Both countries have a huge population and heavy mobile usage. In Thailand, consumers can use messaging app Line to rent powerbanks. Meanwhile, the growing usage of e-wallets such as Ove, Dana, and GoPay in Indonesia might be able to bring the masses on board. 
 
 Singapore:  The city-state offers high e-wallet penetration, and its manageable territory size can reduce operating costs. 
 
 Billion-dollar opportunity 
 Going back to the original question, our research shows a TAM of US$658 million in the near term, so this might deter some investors and entrepreneurs who are seeking outsized returns – with a TAM in the billions of US dollars – from jumping in. 
 However, this TAM calculation is based on China’s current revenue numbers, which though sufficiently large to attract giants like Meituan, still has room for significant growth. IResearch projects that the market will expand by 45% annually from 2020 to 2023. 
 To increase TAM, the market must grow powerbank usage rates and diversify revenue streams. Players in China make almost all their money from rentals right now, and efforts have only just begun to diversify into other income sources. 
 Ultimately, we believe Southeast Asia is a nascent market for shared powerbanks. But despite the challenging conditions, this model can be profitable as long as enough capital is invested to set up and maintain a city-wide network of charging stations, which ensures that users can pick up and drop off powerbanks conveniently. 
 From our analysis, this model won’t have the same struggles as bike-sharing did. Shared powerbank networks will be less expensive to maintain, and powerbanks are not as prone to breakage as compared to a bicycle, according to iResearch data. Overall, the model looks to be less of a public nuisance, too. 
   ﻿   
 Development trends in the region do seem to favor this business model: Smartphone and data usage are set to increase, digital payments and credit scoring systems are becoming more common, and a number of players have access to a sizable network of restaurants. 
 In our view, local powerbank startups are potentially attractive acquisitions or investment targets for larger tech companies looking to get into this space. Grab and Gojek, which share similar qualities with Meituan, come to mind here. However, Covid-19, which is hurting the retail sector and causing these companies to lay off staff and conserve cash, may delay their participation. 
 But there’s also a window of opportunity: Life will go back to normal again, and there isn’t a dominant shared powerbank service anywhere in Southeast Asia for now. A new or existing player could be rewarded by jumping back in just as economic activity picks up again.

650746,Marketing is more essential during a downturn than you might think," It’s  officially   recession   season . 
 The Covid-19 pandemic has had far-reaching effects in almost every industry, whether directly or indirectly.  Large corporations  and  fledgling startups  alike are implementing hiring freezes, pay cuts, and other belt-tightening measures in an effort to protect their bottom line. 
 At first glance, marketing might seem like one of the less essential functions, at least compared to others like product and operations. But should it also be part of the cost-cutting exercises? 
 Play the long game 
    
     
 The short answer is no. Marketing as a whole is still an essential part of the business, even in such times. 
 Short-term activations, however, might need to be reconsidered. With  consumer spending down across all industries  due to lockdown measures and concerns over the direction of the economy, trying to stimulate sales in this climate is quite simply a waste of time and money. 
 But if resources are available, brand marketing – promotions that focus on the overall company and its values rather than sales – should continue. It plays a long-term role in establishing a company’s share of voice, which is heavily correlated to market share. 
 Once economic recovery begins,  regaining lost market share would be costly and difficult , so it’s wise to take the short-term profitability hit now to defend the brand’s piece of the market. 
 Case in point, a  study on revenues and magazine marketing spend during the recession leading up to the Great Depression  found that firms who invested more in marketing grew their revenues much faster and sustained lighter damage to their relative sales than those that did not. Once the recovery period was under way, these businesses also outperformed their competitors. 
 With its potential for storytelling, content marketing is a natural way to keep your brand’s voice active during the pandemic. 
 Stimulating the conversation 
 Take Pinterest, for example. With its use of content marketing, the image-sharing service is telling an overarching story of practicing self-care during the pandemic in a variety of ways that complement each other. 
 In April, it launched a  global campaign called #StayINspired , which showcases content by and for its community that helps people cope with lockdown measures through home-based activities such as arts and crafts and cooking. The company also works closely with  governments  and the  World Health Organization  to prevent the spread of misinformation regarding the coronavirus, and promotes mental well-being with its  “compassionate search”  feature. 
 This relationship-building via content is even more important for business-to-business companies, whose focus is on positioning themselves as thought leaders in their respective verticals. 
 Xero, one of the big names in accounting software solutions,  maintains a blog  where it publishes articles not just about accounting but also on the business and social impact of its solutions. For example, its posts talk about clients and partners, the difficulties they’ve encountered, how they’re adapting to the pandemic, and other stories that put a human face on what could otherwise be a rather dry topic. In other words, Xero uses storytelling elements to discuss its solutions. 
 Be prepared 
 While nothing is certain at this point, a majority of the CEOs in the ASEAN region that were surveyed by Bain &amp; Company in April foresee  economic recovery kicking in around mid-2021 . In the grand scheme of things, that’s not too far away, and it’s paramount that companies maintain or step up their content marketing efforts during this time to sustain or even increase their share of voice. 
 Putting aside business goals,  inspiring stories are needed now more than ever to tide us through this crisis . Brands and the content they produce are part of our culture, playing a similar role as movies and music in our lives – entertaining us, lifting our spirits, and giving us the emotional fuel that we need to keep on keeping on. 
 
 Featuring Ayumi Nakajima, Pinterest’s country manager for Southeast Asia and India, and Andrew Baisley, vice president of sales and accounts at  Tech in Asia , “Effective content marketing in the midst of a pandemic” is an online event that will discuss and explore the key factors that make for compelling content marketing in the current climate.

650627,"Gamer-led, gamer-driven: Why fan communities are the heart of the gaming experience"," For as long as games have existed, so have the communities around them. From classic board games like  Risk  to tabletop role-playing titles such as  Dungeons &amp; Dragons , the lifeblood of any successful game lies in its players and audience. 
 Good ones capture the attention and imagination of players, who in turn become ambassadors who tell – and show – others what makes them so special. This is how gaming helps people build relationships and deepen their passions, empowering each individual as they come together as one community. The  shared camaraderie elevates the overall experience for everyone . 
 Nowhere is that more apparent than in esports. 
 Virtuous cycle 
 “Games have empowered players,” says Justin Lye, regional esports manager at  Garena , a digital entertainment platform under Singapore-based internet giant  Sea . “We used to compete, analyze, and create videos for the games we love – gladly doing it for free. The development of esports has widened the opportunities for many of us to deepen these passions and even translate these into rewarding careers.”

 In recent years, the industry has come up with increasingly creative content, giving games more recognition and expanding their player base. 
 One example is  the phenomenon of “Let’s Play” videos , where players record and publish their playthrough of a video game – often with funny or engaging commentary. This makes for content that’s both informative and entertaining, giving viewers an idea of what a game is like. The trend is so popular that big names in the business, such as PewDiePie, have featured these types of videos on their YouTube channels, which serve to spread awareness and drive up sales for a specific title. 
 “It’s a virtuous cycle of empowerment between games and players,” Lye says. 
 And it’s largely showing results.  50 billion hours  of gaming content was viewed on YouTube in 2018, and  two of the top five channels with the most subscribers worldwide are gaming-related . Last year,   Minecraft  held its position as the most viewed video game on the platform , while Garena’s self-developed battle royale game   Free Fire   came in at fourth. 
 Passion for the games themselves is the catalyst for the creation of these communities. The shared interest connects people initially, and individuals’ skills and preferences then build on the original content. These communities express this passion in different ways – think of the fan art or fanfiction circles that surround movies or video game franchises. 
 Game publishers and other major game organizations understand this, and play an integral part in creating opportunities for these groups – Garena, for example, actively reaches out in various ways. “We have done everything from organizing  cosplay tournaments in Taiwan  to  training shoutcasters  and even  creating a virtual band in Brazil ,” explains Lye. “It’s a case of ‘one passion, many expressions’.” 
 Activities such as fan fiction and cosplaying provide fans with  “a powerful sense of participatory equality” , and allow them to  identify closely with their favorite characters . By actively encouraging these interests, Garena keeps the virtuous cycle turning.

 Expanding universes 
 As audiences grow, opportunities for collaboration with other pop culture icons become more common as well. For example, popular title  Fortnite  has had tie-ups with  Marvel  and  the  Star Wars  franchise  in the form of limited-time characters and in-game weapon and costume options. 
 In other words, growing from a niche interest into a mainstream form of entertainment allows games to enjoy synergies with other prominent entertainment properties. 
 These collaborations encourage a much greater degree of interaction between games and players, says Lye. For example,  Free Fire  partnered with well-known Indonesian actor Joe Taslim to make him  a playable character . Besides appealing to Indonesian fans as a source of local pride, the inclusion of the Hollywood actor’s character also highlights the archipelago to the rest of the world. 
  Free Fire  has also recently  partnered with massively multiplayer online game Ragnarok , adding fashion items and pet options for players to choose from – bringing two popular games and their fans together. 
 “We are always exploring new collaborative opportunities to strengthen our gaming communities across the world,” Lye notes. 
 With offline esports events generally on hold during the current Covid-19 situation, such collaborations have become even more critical in sustaining fan engagement. For instance, in Brazil, long-term Garena partner DJ Alok  took part in an online competition against local  Free Fire  players  as part of the warm up to a live set he performed across local social media channels. 
 Additionally, in Colombia, James Rodriguez and David Ospina – two of the country’s most popular footballers – each  captained teams of  Free Fire  influencers in an online charity tournament  that attracted over a million views. 
 It’s about the player experience 
 Even as esports expands and partnerships with personalities and media properties from other genres and verticals increase, Garena has kept its belief that everything begins with a good core product and how it caters to its primary audience. 
 “These collaborations drive game developers and publishers to constantly push the envelope and improve what we can offer to players,” says Lye. 
 As the industry continues to grow and reach a truly global audience, many more opportunities will be unlocked for players and fans to participate. 
 Case in point: Video content will continue to be a key part of consumer engagement – whether it’s livestreaming or dedicated content made and curated to suit different gamer interests. Garena wants to nurture this group of content creators, promote them, or even bring them in as production specialists. 
 It’s important, Lye says, to recognize these different expressions of gaming passion and to empower them. 
 “As a leading developer and publisher of online games, we remain committed to unlocking even more opportunities for players and fans to participate and grow together with us,” he says.

650852,Tencent’s looming content war," Dear readers, 
 In  Tech in Asia’s  top story last week, our Indonesia journalist Putra Muskita  mapped out the crisscrossing alliances  that are forming in Indonesia. It’s probably the biggest overarching development in the Southeast Asian tech scene, given the high stakes involved. 
   
 A pattern emerges from this chart. On Gojek’s side, you have Tencent, Facebook, and Google, which all do one thing incredibly well: capturing the attention of consumers and monetizing it. 
 But while Facebook and Google primarily leverage content creators for their own benefit, Tencent is a different beast: It owns the platforms and, in some cases, makes the content too. 
 Coincidentally, we’ve devoted plenty of editorial space to Tencent last week, which is appropriate – its stock price is hitting an  all-time high . 
 Our China reporter Nicole Jao explained the Chinese giant’s  “dog-eat-dog” gaming empire  and how fierce internal rivalries have worked well for it. 
 Our Singapore-based reporter Joseph Gan, meanwhile, dove into the  music streaming dance-off between Spotify and Tencent’s Joox , and we found out how their paths are diverging: Spotify is doubling down on podcasts, while Joox now also functions as a social karaoke app. 
 We capped off the week by  looking at Tencent’s decision to buy the struggling video-streaming site Iflix  and how this is part of its big regional push into original content. 
 Tencent’s interest in content extends beyond the company and into its investees. Sea, which is  killing it  right now in the stock market, has a successful gaming business in Garena. 
 Meanwhile, whereas Grab has stayed away from being involved directly in content, Gojek has  raised money  for its spinoff video streaming business. Further distinguishing it from its rival, Gojek even has a  division  that caters to gamers, though it stops short of making actual games. 
 Tencent, it seems, isn’t just going after any kind of content. In response to chatter about how ByteDance’s TikTok is dominating the short video genre, it said this during an earnings call: 
  
  Many observers question the role of high-quality content, given the recent boom in user-generated content such as mini videos. We believe high-quality content has enduring and persistent appeal, providing users with education, lifelong bonding experiences, immersion, and stimulation in a way that is difficult for short-form user-generated content to match.
  
 Tencent also claims that short videos don’t cannibalize long-form formats: 
  
  While short and mini videos have captured significant time spent, we believe it was mostly additive to Internet time spent, as opposed to taking time away from high-quality content. The length of user time spent on high-quality content, such as professional sports, esports, and popular drama series, continues to show healthy growth trends.
  
 As Alibaba and Tencent duel for dominance in Southeast Asia, it seems ByteDance is getting into the mix as well. 
 With ByteDance’s interest in ecommerce and how it’s at loggerheads with Tencent over so many areas, perhaps it would become bedfellows with Alibaba? 
 We’ll find out how this unfolds. In the meantime, you can stay abreast of tech trends in Asia by  subscribing to  Tech in Asia  . 
 I’ll see you next week.

650877,Grab’s CTO for its core tech and transport business steps down," Mark Porter,  Grab ‘s chief technology officer for its core technologies and transport business, has stepped down from the role. 
 In an emailed statement to  Tech in Asia , Porter said that while working for Singapore-based Grab has been “an opportunity of a lifetime,” he left the company to move closer to his family in the US.

 With that, he has taken up the same role for US-based database program MongoDB, where he had been serving as a board member since February this year. 
 “Grab has some of the best tech talent and leaders I’ve had the privilege to work with, and my time here has only reinforced my belief in the company, the mission, and the ultimate success of Grab,” Porter added. 
 With his exit, Grab’s tech leadership team now consists of deliveries and ads CTO Suthen Thomas, Grab Financial Group CTO Vikas Agrawal, and Jerald Singh, group head of product, design, and analytics. 
 “We are sad to see Mark go and are grateful for his contributions to Grab. We will stay the course with our ambitions, focusing on using our platform and tech to find ways for even the smallest micro-entrepreneur or business to improve their livelihoods,” said Grab co-founder Hooi Ling Tan. 
 Grab did not specify whether there will be an immediate replacement for Porter. 
 The now ex-CTO joined Grab in 2018 to help lead the startup’s tech teams across Singapore, Seattle, Beijing, Bangalore, Kuala Lumpur, Taipei, Romania, Ho Chi Minh City, and Jakarta. 
 His exit from the company comes more than a year after Theo Vassilakis relinquished his position as Grab group CTO. (Vassilakis remains an advisor to the company.)

“Can I call you back later? I’m buying durians from a livestream.” And no, I’m not referring to a Twitch gaming stream. 
 In China, livestreaming means online shopping done through a live show that is put on by sellers showcasing their products and giving their sales pitches to an online audience. 
 And this way of selling is about to get a lot  bigger in Southeast Asia  (🔒). 
  Livestreaming is huge  
China’s livestreaming ecommerce was already a US$61.2 billion industry in 2019, and this figure is expected to double this year. 
 During everyone’s favorite shopping festival, Singles’ Day, last November, Taobao Live recorded nearly US$2.8 billion worth of total goods sold. This amount accounted for over 7.5% of the group’s total sales at the one-day event. 
 Sales from livestreaming don’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Instead, it’s growing at a pace of 150% year on year between 2017 and 2019, according to Taobao. 
  A major boost  
How do you shop when malls are shut and you’re encouraged to stay home? 
 As Southeast Asians are increasingly shopping online, they are also picking up the practice of livestream shopping. 
 Ecommerce platform Lazada introduced its LazLive feature in 2018 but it only saw traction recently. The total sales of goods generated through LazLive has climbed 45% month over month and saw over 27 million active live audiences in April. 
 Thailand-based fashion ecommerce Pomelo is not losing out on this numbers game either. Its livestreaming viewership has grown by 1,100% between March and May, albeit off a small base. 
 All these metrics are looking too good for US tech giant Facebook to miss out on, so it also wants in. It launched its free-to-use selling tool Facebook Shops in May, which features a live shopping feature. 
 Our  premium article today  (🔒) goes a lot more in-depth into why livestreaming ecommerce is going to get so huge in Southeast Asia that we may ditch shopping in malls altogether. 
 Expect to see a more detailed analysis on Facebook Shops (and why it isn’t a threat to Shopee and Lazada), Shopee Live’s numbers, a thorough cost breakdown behind a livestream, and, most importantly, the challenges that still remain. 
 How about some cell-based milk for breakfast? 
   
Ever imagined drinking milk that did not come directly from cows or almonds or oats? 
 Singapore-based biotech startup TurtleTree Labs is creating just that using cell-based technology. 
 The company recently  raised US$3.2 million  in its seed round to make its product more accessible to the public; soon, more of us can find out if cell-based milk tastes good. 
  So is it milk?  
Founded just last year, TurtleTree Labs claims to be the first biotech company in the world that can recreate real milk from all mammals inside a lab. 
 The startup was just building its team to create more prototypes when it secured seed money early this year. Now, it boasts a team of more than 20 full-time scientists and engineers. 
 TurtleTree is currently focused on recreating human breast milk first before cow’s milk. 
 Moving forward, it looks to continue accelerating its growth by working with global R&amp;D and manufacturing partners. 
 “We plan to sign our first license contracts by mid-next year. Following that, we will work with our dairy partners to co-develop the end product for consumers,” the CEO added.

650597,Indonesian startup scores series A money to automate school processes," When Indonesia was put on lockdown due to the pandemic, the archipelago’s more than  530,000 schools  temporarily closed down, affecting a total of 68 million students. The crisis underscored the importance of online learning, compelling many educational institutions and even teachers to embrace digital transformation fast.

 An Indonesian startup called  InfraDigital  tried to help with the transition, offering digital payments and online student registration services for free. The company, which just raised an undisclosed amount of series A funding from Taiwan-based AppWorks, digitizes student data, automates back-office processes, and facilitates online tuition payments for schools. 
 It plans to use the new capital injection to develop more school management services. It also looks to expand across Indonesia and double down on provinces where it has the most traction, InfraDigital co-founder and CEO Ian McKenna told  Tech in Asia . 
  What problem is it solving?  According to InfraDigital, most schools in Indonesia still adhere to manual, paper-based processes. Cash is also still dominant. 
 “This can mean students queuing at the admin office at lunchtime, or it can be teachers collecting funds directly from students,” McKenna observed, adding that it’s difficult to accurately assess a school’s financial situation. 
 Moreover, existing digital solutions are costly, especially for schools located in rural areas. 
 InfraDigital claims that its solutions have helped some schools increase their income by up to 16%. 
 One of its offerings, Jaringan IDN, makes student enrollment, invoicing, and payments collection easier for schools. Its partners include Gojek, Tokopedia, LinkAja, Alfamart, Ayopop, and Indomaret. 
 McKenna said they first sit down with a school to get accurate data before implementing a process. “We use the lessons learned from assisting hundreds of schools to digitize, including educating parents on how to pay remotely,” he added. 
 The company claims it’s the only payment network of its kind in the country. Although it indirectly competes with bank services and overlaps with some features of business-to-business edtech platforms, InfraDigital can find ways to partner with them since its services are niche. 
  What are its future plans?  For now, the company is focusing on helping schools deal with the complexities of business closures during the lockdown. 
 “We’re currently focused on building the underlying technical infrastructure so that we can eventually layer more value-added services on top for all stakeholders involved, including administrators, teachers, students, and parents,” said Indah Maryani, co-founder of InfraDigital. 
 Looking ahead, McKenna hopes a majority of schools will be able to implement digital solutions in the next two to three years. 
 “Longer term, our goal remains the same: to provide every school in Indonesia, regardless of resources, with solid digital and financial foundations. The industry is at an early stage and we have a lot of work to do, a lot of schools to reach.” 
  How much traction has it gotten?  The company said it aims to reach every school in the archipelago, which has a little over 300,000 schools and around 50 million students. 
 InfraDigital is currently active in 12 provinces in Indonesia. Its platform is deployed in over 300 educational institutions, serving more than  140,000  students in tier-two cities as well as in rural areas. 
 In 2018, the startup reported a total transaction value of US$2.1 million. It declined to disclose current figures.

650747,Tencent isn’t slowing down this year," Chinese internet giant  Tencent Holdings , which operates the ubiquitous app WeChat, is not showing any signs of slowing down this year. 
    
     
 Last week, its market cap hit a record high, briefly breaching US$600 billion. It has been on a steady rise since March, with May seeing a big jump after the tech behemoth announced its quarterly results. 
 Business is going well for Tencent. In the first quarter of this year, it generated US$15 billion in total revenue, up by 26% over the same period last year. 
 Its music arm Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) reported total revenues of  US$891 million  during the same period and is expected to increase by 8.5% in the second quarter. Dubbed as China’s Spotify, TME operates QQ Music, Kugou, Kuwo, WeSing, and Ultimate Music, providing a bunch of music services such as online karaoke and music livestreaming. 
 Its gaming unit Tencent Games – home to popular titles such as  Honor of Kings ,  PUBG Mobile , and  League of Legends  – saw US$5.3 billion in revenues in the first quarter, representing a 31% year-on-year growth. 
  See also:  Tencent’s “dog-eat-dog” gaming empire   
 Its social networks raked in US$3.6 billion, while its fintech and business services gained US$3.7 billion. 
 Tencent has been actively investing as well. According to  Reuters , the company’s portfolio has reached over  US$66 billion . Some of its big bets include ecommerce leaders JD.com and Pinduoduo, which has reached a market cap of  US$100 billion  in less than five years. 
 It has also poured funds into livestreaming, with two major gaming-focused streaming platforms Douyu and Huya. Tencent is also rolling out a  Twitch-like app  via its affiliate company Trovo Live (formerly Madcat) as it forays into the US social media landscape. 
 Outside of China, Tencent acquired a  10% stake  in Universal Music Group for nearly US$3.4 billion. It’s also reportedly in talks to invest  US$200 million  for a stake in Warner Music Group. 
 Most recently, it  acquired  the Malaysia-based Iflix to extend the reach of its own video-streaming service WeTV across Southeast Asia. With over 25 million monthly active users and a library of local original content, Iflix will propel Tencent’s overall push into original content. 
 Interestingly, Tencent is also reportedly eyeing a stake in  video-streaming rival iQiyi . ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.99962944)]","['app', 'fintech', 'Legends', 'Iflix', 'TME', 'Reuters', 'iQiyi']","['US', 'Pinduoduo', 'WeSing', 'Malaysia', 'China']"
650398,TurtleTree Labs secures $3.2m to bring its cell-based milk to the market," “The Covid-19 situation highlights the need for food security, not just in Singapore, but globally. It is heart-wrenching to see excess milk being dumped because of the global lockdown,” said TurtleTree Labs CEO Fengru Lin. 
 Lin runs a Singapore-based biotech startup  TurtleTree Labs , which uses cell-based technology to create milk. It just raised US$3.2 million in its seed round to accelerate its plans.

 The round saw participation from VC firms Green Monday Ventures, KBW Ventures, CPT Capital, Artesian, and New Luna Ventures, according to a statement. 
 Founded just last year, TurtleTree Labs claims to be the first biotech company in the world that can recreate real milk from all mammals inside a lab. The company’s focus, however, is on high-value human breast milk, followed by cow’s milk. 
 The company said it plans to use the new funds to help inch its product closer to commercialization. Currently, the startup has its own in-house bioprocessing team working with industrial partners for its pilot facility, Lin told  Tech in Asia . 
 “The bioreactors that we are working with have well-defined technology that allows us to linearly scale up to 50,000-liter industrial-scale bioreactors,” she said. 
  See also:  Singapore startup wants to make cow’s milk – without cows   
  What are its future plans?  Moving forward, the company said it looks to continue accelerating its growth by working with global R&amp;D and manufacturing partners. 
 For 2020 specifically, Lin said the team aims to optimize a 5-liter continuous-flow bioreactor that churns out milk. “We plan to sign our first license contracts by mid-next year. Following that, we will work with our dairy partners to co-develop the end product for consumers,” the CEO added. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  The startup was just building its team to create more prototypes when it secured seed money early this year. 
 Now, it boasts a team of more than 20 full-time scientists and engineers, allowing the company to start collaboration talks with several major dairy and infant nutrition companies. 
 “We have a strong understanding of what the initial SKUs will look like working with them,” Lin said. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  Like most startups, TurtleTree Labs had to adjust to and develop a safety plan to cope with the pandemic. The company said it has received support from the Singapore government, giving them a financial boost to continue working amid Covid-19. 
 The startup also looks to use this support to work towards its plans, as it recognizes how the pandemic underscored the importance of food security. 
 “Food tech innovation in Asia is way overdue,” said David Yeung, founder of Green Monday Group. “If the rapidly deteriorating climate change situation isn’t enough to convince the world, the pandemic surely hammers home the urgency that we need to overhaul the food system for the sake of public health, food safety, and food security.” 
  What is the company’s funding history?  When TurtleTree Labs was established last year, the co-founders self-funded the startup with around US$500,000. 
 Prior to its seed round, TurtleTree Labs raised an undisclosed amount of  seed funding  from Lever VC, KBW Ventures, and K2 Global in January. ",Miguel Cordon,0,3,"[(1, 0.999655)]",[],"['Artesian', 'Singapore', 'Asia']"

650646,How big will livestreaming ecommerce get in Southeast Asia?," This durian season, Lawrence Lim, who runs traditional confectionery store Gin Thye, is turning to ecommerce platforms Lazada and Shopee to livestream his shop’s products. That’s on top of the livestreams it conducts regularly on Facebook via partnerships with third-party seller pages like  KakilangSG  that have their own following. 
 In a recent one-hour livestream on Shopee that drew close to 900 viewers, a host unboxed Gin Thye products, showcased their packaging, shared her “honest” reviews, and answered queries in real time. “It is really silky and smooth… If you’re a durian lover like me, you’d definitely not want to miss this!” she exclaims, while eating a durian mousse. 
 
  A livestreamer sells Gin Thye products on Shopee Live. 
 
 In China, livestreaming ecommerce was a  US$61.2 billion industry  in 2019, a figure that’s expected to double this year. Three main players dominate the Chinese market: Alibaba’s Taobao Live, which was launched in 2016, as well as short-video apps Douyin and Kuaishou. 
 Covid-19 has accelerated the pickup of the ecommerce format in Southeast Asia, which is home to over 650 million people. While Lazada introduced its LazLive feature as early as in 2018, Covid-19 has given the trend a further boost, as pandemic-induced lockdowns across the region in the past few months forced many to explore other ways of discovering new products. 
 Lazada said it welcomed over 27 million active live audiences in April, adding that it has over 65 million annual active consumers. 
 US tech giant Facebook is the latest to want in on Southeast Asia’s thriving ecommerce scene. The launch of its free-to-use selling tool  Facebook Shops  in May and a recent  investment in Gojek  are strong indicators of its ecommerce ambitions in the region. 
 How big is the opportunity? 
 While the scale of livestreaming in Southeast Asia has yet to match China’s, the region has great potential, says Xiaofeng Wang, a senior analyst at market research firm Forrester. 
 The growth trajectory of livestreaming in China could shed light on how fast and how far the phenomenon can take off in Southeast Asia. 
 In its Singles’ Day shopping festival last November, Taobao Live recorded a gross merchandise volume (GMV) worth  nearly 20 billion yuan (US$2.8 billion) , which accounted for over 7.5% of the group’s total sales in the one-day event. 
 Between April 2018 to March 2019, Taobao generated more than 100 billion yuan (US$15.1 billion) in GMV through Taobao Live. Ecommerce sales from livestreaming grew at a pace of 150% year-on-year between 2017 to 2019,  according to Taobao . 
 However, it appears that livestreaming makes up only a small percentage of ecommerce sales even though Taobao Live is also available to Tmall merchants. 
 It’s likely that livestreaming will feature as part of a broader suite of services including games, social networking, and in-app chats, which collectively work to increase user engagement and time spent on the platforms. At the same time, traditional ecommerce is expected to continue its dominance. 
    
     
 Shopee and Lazada have declined to disclose the percentage of total ecommerce sales being driven by livestreams. 
 But because Shopee Live is still in its infancy – it was rolled out  in June 2019  – the number is probably not significant yet, based on  Tech in Asia ’s back-of-the-envelope calculation for Shopee. 
 Shopee’s GMV was  US$17.6 billion in 2019 . 
 
  Using a generous estimate of 1.7% (Taobao Live’s contribution to total marketplace GMV in 2019, its fourth year of operations), Shopee could potentially see US$299 million in GMV from livestreaming transactions just a year after its launch.  
 At a take rate of 4.1% in FY 2019, Shopee could soon record US$12.3 million in annual revenue from livestreaming. To put that into context, Shopee made US$731 million in marketplace revenue in 2019. 
 
 If Southeast Asia follows China’s trajectory, livestreaming can play a sizable but niche role in ecommerce. 
 Accelerated by the pandemic 
 There are signs, however, that Covid-19 has given the trend a major boost. 
 Total GMV generated through LazLive climbed 45% month over month in April, at the height of lockdowns across Southeast Asia as cities shuttered malls. Lazada aims to increase daily livestreaming sessions by 50% and expects total viewers to rise by 40% month-on-month by the end of June.

 Much of the growth is being driven by offline consumers going online. While users between age 18 and 34 are the most active on Shopee Live, the platform is gaining higher viewership from people aged between 34 to 50 across the region. 
 Fashion retailer Pomelo is also seeing more offline shoppers buying online. “That’s what’s driving the doubling of new customers,” says CEO David Jou. 
 Livestreaming viewership on the Thailand-based ecommerce platform, which streams on its app and on Facebook, has also grown 1,100% between March to May, albeit off a small base, Jou admits. Pomelo has reached over 13 million people through livestreams it held between March to May. 
 “Just having a static product page is just not that interesting anymore for a lot of users. They want to see the product live, they want to ask questions, they want to interact. If they can do all that, they are more likely to convert,” Jou observes. 
    
     
 While livestream content focused on fashion, health and beauty, and electronics is already popular among Southeast Asian users, livestreams for food products, groceries, and general merchandise have gained momentum amid the Covid-19 crisis, Lazada said in May. 
 Will shopping behavior persist even as the pandemic subsides? Shoppers may continue purchasing consumer packaged goods online, but they may return to stores for items such as food and produce due to their perceived freshness, Forrester’s Wang says. 
 Facebook’s foray 
 While livestreaming ecommerce could very well grow on its own in Southeast Asia, it’s tech behemoth Facebook that could end up reaping a sizable chunk of the market share. 
 In China, Alibaba didn’t need to contend with Facebook, but that’s not the case in Southeast Asia, where the social media giant’s apps continue to hog eyeballs. 
    
     
 The company’s Facebook Pay feature could soon be launched in Indonesia and offer Gojek’s GoPay as a payment option. The move will deepen Facebook’s reach in the archipelago, where GoPay is a dominant mode of transaction. 
 The integration of shopping features across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp channels will create closed-loop purchases across the various platforms, pitting it against Shopee and Lazada. 
 Facebook Shops’ live shopping feature will also allow businesses to feature product launches and tutorials, among other content, in real-time. Currently, more than 800 million people all over the world engage with live video on Facebook and Instagram daily, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said  in a May announcement . 
 Compared to ecommerce apps, user engagement is more organic on Facebook, where products are pushed to users as they scroll through their feeds, says an analyst who isn’t authorized to speak to the media. Clicking and opening an ecommerce app for the sole purpose of browsing products is “a conscious decision and hence a friction point,” the source notes. 
 However, the analyst predicts that professional merchants are likely to stay on Shopee and Lazada, whereas Facebook and Instagram will facilitate the “amateur or occasional” sellers. 
 Players in Southeast Asia aren’t worried. “Facebook Shops is going to be a great tool for small sellers. […] For us, the point of differentiation for our users is in pickup,” Pomelo’s Jou says, referring to how the platform allows shoppers to try on clothes before they complete their online purchase. Bad fit or wrong sizing remain the largest pain points in shopping for clothes online.

 Forrester analyst Wang doesn’t consider Facebook a big threat to Shopee and Lazada. That’s because for the most part, consumers in the region are more used to shopping at online marketplaces compared to social media channels. 
 Without serious investment in local markets, it wouldn’t be easy for any foreign company to build a successful and sustainable business in the region. Having a variety of options, especially for local products is very important to consumers in Southeast Asia, Wang says, which is why “Amazon Prime isn’t as attractive as Redmart to local consumers.” 
 For Lazada and Shopee, being able to charge for merchant services that Facebook can’t offer works in their favor. Both platforms have also built logistical fulfillment networks with regional partners. This is an essential service particularly for sellers looking to ship overseas, given Southeast Asia’s underdeveloped infrastructure and patchy logistics network. 
 Alibaba’s payment affiliates in the region, including TrueMoney in Thailand and GCash in the Philippines, also make a user’s shopping journey as seamless as possible. 
 “Ecommerce isn’t a strength of Facebook. It [hasn’t] mastered social commerce in its home market yet. I doubt it will become a threat to Lazada or Shopee in the near-term,” Wang adds. 
 Lazada is confident that its closed-loop ecosystem of logistics, payments, and technology will prime it for success. “We think all the foundations that are required for livestreaming to take off are already there,” says chief product officer Raymond Yang. 
 The merchant equation 
 While livestreaming is free on Southeast Asia’s major ecommerce platforms, success is more likely for those who have some help, whether in marketing or logistics. Shopee and Lazada can provide such services at a small fee. 
 Merchants have had to adapt quickly. “It does take a lot of coordination [and] back-end setup. Selecting the right person in place to host the live stream is very key,” Yee Ling Lee, digital marketing manager at JBL for Asia Pacific, tells  Tech in Asia .

 The US-based audio equipment company has been running livestreams on LazLive since 2018. It also regularly holds livestreams on Shopee Live and occasionally taps Instagram Live. 
 Shopee has a range of advertising and production tools to help sellers get started, including hiring social influencers to host livestream sessions or designing homepage banner ads to maximize their reach, says Agatha Soh, the company’s head of regional marketing. 
 To educate brands and sellers, Shopee also provides step-by-step guides, regular tutorial webinars, as well as tips and tricks on how to improve the effectiveness of their livestreams. 
 Lazada offers similar marketing tools as well as  studio venues for rent . The price range of such services, which includes marketing support, is “not expensive at all,” says product executive Yang. 
 However, it’s less of a monetization opportunity and more of helping merchants get acquainted with the service, he explains. Shopee and Lazada are tight-lipped on how much their livestreaming-related services cost. 
 From the merchant’s perspective, a range of costs are involved in setting up a livestreaming session. To maximize visibility on a livestream, additional dollars have to go into external marketing pushes to direct traffic from its target audience to the session. This can take up a bulk of the costs of running a livestream, JBL’s Lee says. 
    
     
 On the whole, however, livestreaming is still a relatively more cost-effective option compared to TV advertising, she says. 
 But how effective is it in driving sales? “I would say that livestreaming is part of your marketing mix, and I would generally classify this as more of a brand [and] product awareness mechanic, [rather] than a conversion activity,” Lee points out. 
 She adds that the eventual sales conversion depends on the product category, with customers less likely to make an impulse purchase for items with a higher price point. 
 Since livestreaming is a new approach in Southeast Asia, merchants will need more help in general. 
 While the livestreaming service is free, Gin Thye’s Lim says its products on Lazada and Shopee are sold at a discount of between 10% to 20%, in exchange for the marketing and livestreaming support it receives. “We support each other,” he explains. 
 Lim believes that passive listings on an ecommerce site no longer cut it. While Gin Thye also lists its products on other platforms like Qoo10, Ezbuy, and Redmart, a single livestream session on Shopee or Lazada can easily trump two weeks of sales from regular product listings because of higher visibility. 
 Visibility matters when so many merchants are competing to get a shopper’s attention. Frontpage ad placements, which platforms provide at no extra cost (at least for now), have been crucial in garnering eyeballs, Lim notes. 
 But livestreaming slots are limited, and that’s an issue that merchants like Lim face. As a result, Gin Thye continues to run sessions on other platforms such as Facebook, even though doing so requires more effort, such sourcing for its own livestreaming hosts. 
 Since livestreaming is the trend now, “you’ll have to do it more often and regularly,” Lim says. But as the concept catches on, merchants could see diminishing returns on livestreaming. 
 Building a foundation 
 In a  wildly successful instance  in China, appliance manufacturer Gree Electric Appliances sold 310 million yuan (US$43.5 million) of goods in a 90-minute livestreaming event on Kuaishou. 
 “People we speak to say livestreaming does bring in more sales,” an equity analyst who requested anonymity tells  Tech in Asia . 
 But unlike shoppers in China, consumers in Southeast Asia are less digitally empowered and less willing to experiment with new technologies. This, in turn, slows down the adoption of new tools and experiences, whether in livestreaming ecommerce or in mobile payments, in a market that’s “more fragmented,” according to Forrester’s Wang. 
 “Consumers are still forming the habit of shopping online, let alone livestreaming,” she explains. To grow at China’s pace, livestreaming offerings will need to match up in terms of the quantity and frequency of sessions, participating brands, product variety, and video quality as well as the professionalism of hosts and aggressiveness of promotions. 
 In Southeast Asia, the kinks are still being worked out.

 “One of the main differences is that you need to start with the entertainment side and then transition to the shopping side,” Pomelo’s Jou says. In China, “it’s all about using influencers to sell products.” 
 In Thailand, Pomelo weaves in shopping with content that’s driving the most engagement: food, healthy living, and inspirational material. It has featured chef recipes, work-from-home routines, and morning workouts in its livestreams. 
 “[Consumers] are coming for the content. If they discover a great product in the process and you make it easy for them to shop, that works,” Jou says. “But if you just say, ‘We’re going to have an online livestream shopping experience,’ that isn’t as attractive, especially if you don’t have really large discounts or mega promotions.” 
 Another challenge is the lack of livestreaming talent. 
 “If you’re a brand that wants to go into livestreaming, which of your employees can do that?” asks Yang, who spearheaded product development and innovation for Chinese commerce site Taobao before joining Lazada in 2017. 
 Taobao Live alone plans to train more than 10,000 retail sales people across China to become livestreamers who can each reach audiences of 10,000 or more, and another 100,000 hosts who can potentially earn a monthly income of over 10,000 yuan (US$1,400) each. 
 Compared to China, Southeast Asia doesn’t have such a readily available talent pool. 
 To bridge that gap, Lazada has launched a LazTalent program in Thailand and Vietnam to recruit and train brand hosts, with the hope of them eventually becoming key opinion leaders or KOLs. “It’s like a matchmaking marketplace between them and brands who need promoters,” Yang explains. 
 It seems like it won’t be long before armies of hosts will be hawking all kinds of products across Southeast Asia.

650645,Byju’s said to hit $10.5b in valuation," Indian edtech startup  Byju’s  has reached a valuation of US$10.5 billion to become the second-most valued startup in the country, surpassing embattled budget hotel chain Oyo,  Bloomberg  reported, citing a source. 
 Byju’s announced Friday that it had secured new funding from US investor Bond Capital. While the funding amount was undisclosed, a source told  Livemint  that it was around US$100 million. 
  Tech in Asia  has reached out to Byju’s to learn more. 
 
  Byju Raveendran, the founder &amp; CEO of Byju’s. 
 
 The startup’s latest funding comes after it secured  US$200 million  from Tiger Global in January this year. It was also said to have raised another US$200 million from General Atlantic, boosting its valuation to  US$8.2 billion . 
 The fresh funds from Bond Capital put Byju’s in India’s top three highest-valued startups. Fintech leader Paytm takes the no. 1 spot, with a valuation of  US$16 billion , while Oyo rounds off the list with a  US$10 billion  valuation. 
 With a portfolio that includes Airbnb, Facebook, JD.com, Spotify, and Uber, among others, Bond’s investment in Byju’s marks its first in an Indian startup. 
 In the coming months, Byju’s is likely to raise more capital, according to the  Livemint  report. But in the meantime, it looks like it’s seeking to further expand its reach in smaller cities in India by buying edtech startup Doubtnut. According to a report by  TechCrunch , the deal would value the smaller player at US$125 million to US$150 million. 
 Early this year, Doubtnut said it had over 13 million monthly active users across its website, app, YouTube channel, and WhatsApp platforms. It most recently raised  US$15 million  in a round led by Tencent. 
 Byju’s now serves over 57 million registered students and more than 3.5 million paid subscribers, with about US$370 million in revenue, according to a statement. 
 Having attracted 6 million new students in March and another 7.5 million in April, the company is looking to hire at least 4,000 employees in six months. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(0, 0.9995586)]","['Oyo', 'app', 'Bond', 'WhatsApp', 'Fintech']","['Airbnb', 'US', 'Asia', 'Facebook', 'Byju', 'India']"

 The round also saw participation from VC firms Signum Capital, Du Capital, and FinLab EOS VC, according to a statement.

 Launched in 2019, Sparrow offers bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) options settled by smart contracts, or self-executing contracts that have the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly baked into lines of code. This automates the settlement of contracts and makes the process more transparent for the parties involved. 
 The company said it plans to use the new funds to accelerate platform development. This includes creating new wealth management products and services as well as improving financial reporting tools for its users, the company told  Tech in Asia.  
 In May, Sparrow launched a mobile web experience to enable users to easily trade options on the go. It aims to follow it up with the launch of smartphone app experiences “pretty soon,” the company shared. 
  What problem is it solving?  According to Sparrow, customized options can be too complex and risky for the average user. This is why only high-net-worth individuals or professionals usually have access to them. 
 “Typically, option trading systems are closed in nature and require trust in the counterparty or a clearing house. Liquidity is also limited because the customization tends to be bilateral in nature instead of multilateral,” the company explained. 
 With its products, Sparrow looks to make options trading more accessible to anyone by offering trading tools tailored to the needs of professionals and beginners alike. 
  What’s the opportunity?  The crypto derivatives market has seen rapid growth in the past few years, Sparrow said. Citing data from crypto data analytics firm Skew,  Coindesk  reported that the growth of Bitcoin options trading has been outpacing that of the cryptocurrency’s futures and swaps market. 
 “We see a lot of untapped opportunities and potentials in the nascent crypto options market, especially as traders seek more sophisticated tools to hedge their positions and manage risks,” Sparrow said. 
 However, with a growing demand comes the rise of more service providers. The startup said it has seen a recent increase in exchanges offering options apart from Deribit, the largest exchange by options trading volume. These include more traditional exchanges such as OKEx, Binance, and FTX. 
 Sparrow added, however, that the increase in competition is welcome to the budding crypto options, as it can help the ecosystem grow faster. 
  How is the startup different?  To stand out, Sparrow designed its offerings to be easily accessible. The startup said that 90% of trades on its platform are placed using its simplified interface. 
 Sparrow has also implemented a full know-your-customer process to make its platform more secure from a regulatory perspective. To double down on safety, the company hands over the custody of customer assets to independent regulated custodian BitGo. 
  How much traction is it targeting?  Since its launch, the company said it has seen options trading volume on its platform grow to US$150 million. 
 “Volumes have tripled since the start of the year. With this round of funding, we are in a good position to bring even more exciting trading products to the market and increase our market share,” said Sparrow CEO Kenneth Yeo. 
 The company declined to disclose any target numbers for 2020 and beyond. 
  Who are the team members?  Before leading Sparrow, Yeo spent nine years working at Omega Proprietary Trading, an independent group that specializes in high-frequency trading for the futures of global listed derivatives markets. 
 The rest of the startup’s team consists of seasoned traders, tech experts, and experienced blockchain security specialists. ",Miguel Cordon,0,3,"[(0, 0.35858992), (2, 0.6372882)]","['VC', 'FTX', 'Skew', 'Binance', 'BTC', 'ETH']","['Asia', 'Deribit', 'Singapore', 'Bitcoin']"
650605,Iflix deal signals Tencent’s big push into original content," In a bid to expand the presence of its streaming platform in Southeast Asia, Tencent has  struck a deal to buy Iflix , a regional player that has established a sizeable user base but failed to generate equivalent financial results.

 While the Chinese entertainment giant confirmed that the purchase is aimed at growing its WeTV unit, it declined to give further details when  Tech in Asia  reached out for comment. WeTV has already amassed close to 20 million downloads across Southeast Asia in the past 12 months, according to data from analytics platform App Annie. 
 Iflix is currently available in 13 countries across Asia, including Pakistan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. 
 As of April 2020, Iflix had had over 25 million monthly active users on its platform, though it’s unclear how many of them are paying subscribers. The deal will combine Tencent’s regional reach with Iflix’s library of local original content – a type of asset that the Chinese firm is strongly pursuing,  Tech in Asia  research suggests. 
 The move is part of Tencent’s overall push into original content in China and the rest of Asia, cutting across video,  games , and  music . 
 Staying original and making money 
 Tencent’s total video subscriptions rose 26% year on year to  112 million  during the first quarter of 2020. Its subscription revenue, which includes both its video and music offerings, grew to 62.4 billion yuan (US$8.8 billion) during the same period from the nearly 49 billion (US$6.9 billion) it recorded in 2019. 
 Tencent attributed the growth to original content that caters to its mainly Chinese audience. It singled out its original productions, such as the third season of  The Land of Warriors  and  Eternal Love of Dream , as major growth drivers. 
 The company appears to be emphasizing quality productions over quantity these days. 
 Tencent released 216 programs in 2019 versus 252 in 2018. Despite the drop in quantity, viewing time in 2019 went up to 35.19 min compared to 33.64 min in 2018. 
 And similar to  its games production , the company has taken a data-driven approach in video content production and promotion. 
 Tencent has a “golden rule” for online video-streaming promos, a tip it shared in its  videos annual report . In the first 20 minutes, the show or the endorsement should aim to reach 60% of core customers and have at least one “bao dian” (i.e., a twist or memorable moment) either in the episode or the ad. 
 Tencent also understands that Southeast Asia could dig its Chinese original productions. In Thailand,   The Untamed  , an original production by Tencent Pictures, racked up more than 100 million views. 
 With its Iflix acquisition, Tencent could export more Chinese originals to Southeast Asia, potentially maximizing revenue for each production. 
 “This library of Chinese content, and Iflix’s collection of Korean, Southeast Asian, and Indian content, together with Tencent’s warchest, can present an interesting alternative to the other global and regional entertainment streaming providers,” App Annie told  Tech in Asia.  
 The reverse could also be true, which was proven by  Bad Genius , a locally produced Thai comedy movie that generated  more revenue in China  than it did in Thailand. 
    
     
 It seems Iflix will continue to exist: Tencent tells  Tech in Asia  that majority of Iflix’s employees will be retained. “Our current priority is to ensure smooth integration [between Iflix and] our existing business and also talent retention,” the company added. 
 Among the region’s video-streaming platforms, Iflix is one of the biggest producers of local original content. “Our most popular and impactful shows are predominantly local ones,” Iflix ex-CEO Mark Britt shared previously. For instance, its Indonesian drama series Magic Hour broke “ every metric ” on its platform in 2018, topping US superhero series  The Flash  and popular Korean drama  Goblin . 
 In a  2019 interview  with  The Australian Finance Review , Iflix co-founder Patrick Grove said: 
 “People in the West assume that as Southeast Asia’s middle class grows, as people own a house and a car for the first time, they’re suddenly going to want to watch  Star Wars  or  Orange Is The New Black . We license those on Iflix, they do OK. But when we make a new Filipino movie, or a special with a Malaysian comedian, they explode.” 
 The combination of Tencent’s financial muscle and expertise in data and content production with Iflix’s local know-how and regional reach seem to indicate a formidable partnership. 
 Another plus factor of the deal: Iflix has already amassed a vast library of content, partnering with studios and distribution partners such as NBC Universal, Discovery, Paramount Pictures, and Warner Bros. It also has  partnerships with  many local media companies in the region to enhance its inventory. 
 Given that original content is king, it puts local film and content platforms such as  Viddsee  in a very interesting spot. 
 Video streaming in Southeast Asia 
 However, creating original and localized content is not the be-all and end-all to make it in Southeast Asia’s online streaming market. 
 In 2017, when other players like Netflix and Hong Kong’s Viu were also just trying to capture market share, Iflix raised  US$133 million  to put more content on its platform. 
 While the strategy helped attract millions of new users, Iflix failed to monetize its growth and faced financial distress, which potentially led to its sale. 
  Read:  Video streaming in Asia is not for the faint of heart   
 Hooq, which is backed by telecommunications major Singtel and a joint venture that also involves Sony Pictures Television and Warner Bros., also took a similar approach. 
 In 2019, the Singapore-headquartered company announced it would be developing at least  100 original shows  and films by the end of 2020. These shows were set to be produced in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and India. 
 But as Netflix entered more markets in the region, Hooq struggled to generate major gains and eventually  filed for liquidation  in March 2020. 
    
     
 Right now, Netflix is still WeTV’s biggest competitor in Southeast Asia. 
 According to a  recent report  from Media Partners Asia, the US-based service leads the region in average weekly watch minutes, with Viu coming in second. 
 The study also placed new entrants iQiyi, Tencent, and HBO in a good position for growth, as they will be able to ride on Southeast Asia’s rising consumption.

650579,"Pivots, layoffs and post-Covid plans from Grain and Chope’s founders","  Tech in Asia ’s No BS series is a lineup of straightforward conversations with founders, investors, and makers. In each live session, which is moderated by  Tech in Asia  founder Willis Wee, we talk about the hard things about our guests’ journeys and experiences. 
 We kicked off the first session of the series last week with Arrif Ziaudeen and Yi Sung Yong, the founders of restaurant reservation app Chope and food delivery startup Grain, respectively. 
 With the food and beverage sector being one of the hardest hit industries during Covid-19, particularly for F&amp;B startups in the business-to-business space, we wanted to know how Ziaudeen and Sung were coping with the ongoing crisis and how they’re moving away from the B2B market. 
   ﻿   
 The pivots 
 When Singapore imposed the circuit breaker — a two-month long period that effectively ended all dine-in activity amid the pandemic – Chope saw a large impact on its business. As a startup that focuses on restaurant reservations, it had to switch gears quickly. A few days after the measures were announced, it was able to launch its online delivery services working with medium to high-end restaurants. 
 This was largely the same experience for Grain. While the startup handles food deliveries, it mainly caters to corporations, and Covid-19 ended 95% of this business. To recuperate, the company focused more resources on its business-to-consumer segment and grew it by 10x to 12x in the past couple of months. Although it still saw a net drop in overall sales, the result is much better than having all of its revenue evaporate, said Sung. 
 The bad: Pay cuts and layoffs 
 Chope carried out pay cuts and furloughs in April, which Ziaudeen said was already a slow reaction. 
 The decision to do so wasn’t easy, either. There were a lot of uncertainties: Was management being too severe? Were they not as prudent? Was the decision correct? What would be the emotional impact on the employees? But what the founder learned overall was to make the decision fast and not look back. 
 Grain, on the other hand, reacted swiftly, cutting 10% of its workforce and removing all other additional staff-related costs like pay for part-timers, contractors, and staff benefits in February. Three weeks later, however, Sung realized that the company needed to do a bigger layoff exercise. “In hindsight, one cut is better than two cuts,” said Sung. 
 The good: Opportunities 
 Pre-Covid-19, Chope would have never thought about going into the food delivery business. But with the pivot comes a new host of opportunities. The startup has managed to onboard restaurants that it didn’t even expect would allow food deliveries – Michelin star restaurants among them. 
 It’s also found itself in a niche space. A survey Chope carried out in May found that  42% of restaurants  in Singapore do not currently have delivery options. So Chope, having already built existing relationships with several restaurant partners, had a leg up. 
 While the startup’s focus after the pandemic is still going to be on its dine-in services, Ziaudeen sees having a delivery option as a great add-on to its business, allowing users a choice to eat in or dine out and enabling the company to own the food category for diners. 
 Meanwhile, Sung sees the pandemic as an opportunity for Grain to focus on its B2C business, which it had started years ago. Over time, however, the company gradually moved into the B2B space, as there were less competitors and the average order value was a lot higher than in B2C. 
 With Covid-19, Sung wants to relaunch Grain’s B2C segment, partnering with popular companies like bubble tea chain Koi and juice and smoothie brand Boost. 
 Moving forward, Grain wants to balance both the B2B and B2C sides of its business. And similar to Chope, Sung wants to provide a better user experience by giving customers freedom of choice: Users can order their own meals if they’re eating alone and call for catering when they have a gathering.

650390,Games people play: How Shopee uses data science to make shopping a holistic experience," Online shopping in Southeast Asia has truly taken off, and data shows it will get even bigger. 
 According to the  e-Conomy SEA 2019 report  released by Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company, 49 million people in the region either bought or sold items online in 2015. Just four years later, that number tripled to 150 million. 
 With the rise in users comes an increase in money spent. The ecommerce market was worth US$32 billion in 2019, making it the biggest sector in the internet economy, ahead of other heavyweight industries like online travel and ride-hailing. 
 What are ecommerce firms doing to stand out in such a highly competitive field? 
 As the attention span of users gets shorter, ecommerce players need to come up with different ways to keep them engaged, says Pan Yaozhang, head of data science at  Shopee . “This can include games, livestreaming videos, and other interactive features.” 
 Online shopping is often done using mobile phones, and this is especially true for Shopee, where over 95% of orders are made on its mobile app, adds Pan. “Our platform was built to be highly mobile and social from the start,” she says.

 To retain users, the company has made shopping a more holistic experience by applying data science to focus on three key areas: personalization, engagement, and social. 
 Personalization 
 Southeast Asian consumers are diverse. That’s why Shopee employs artificial intelligence and big data to interpret large data sets that allow it to identify “relationships and patterns in users’ shopping behavior,” shares Pan. 
 To analyze the data and build AI models that profile the company’s entire user base, Shopee’s data science team works with its local marketing and design counterparts. Localization is important, as the region generates such a huge amount of data that it’s “difficult to generalize to all markets,” says Pan. Data science helps the team make sense of local data and build models that are able to carry out functions like specifying which customized banners and marketing assets are displayed to each specific user group across the markets. 
 Diving deeper into the shopping experience, data science also plays a part in building shopper models for each market, based on various behavioral and demographic data such as gender, age, brand preferences, and preferred shopping features. 
 “In Indonesia, for example, we find from the data that users can be grouped into different profiles based on what brands and categories they prefer,” observes Wang Chen, data science lead for marketing science. “This allows us to make the shopping experience more intuitive, with fine-tuned recommendations.” 
 Meanwhile, users in Singapore have a strong preference for flash sales and limited-time promotions. Shopee taps into this by diving “deep into the data to discover what products and categories are popular across the day,” explains Wang. 
 “This allows us to better plan our flash sales calendar and curate a better shopping experience for users every day.” 
 Engagement 
 While buying things online might seem like a quick and mundane process, Shopee works toward engaging its customers more and keeping them on the app for longer. 
 Shopee Games does exactly this. Users can play games in exchange for rewards such as Shopee coins – the platform’s virtual currency that can be applied at checkout to get discounts – or for brand-sponsored products. 
 Data science has also been instrumental in game development. An observation that users are actively playing the company’s suite of in-app games led to the development of a new game called Shopee Farm. In this game, users log in to “water” a plant, which accumulates points and presents a prize when fully grown. 
 A social element is included, where users can water their friends’ plants, thus earning more rewards. Shopee Farm offers users greater rewards for long-term effort, as opposed to previous games which focused on one-time rewards. 
 The initiative has proven a success, with over 1 billion in-app games played in 2019. The most popular in-app games have ‘group play modes’ that offer users greater rewards when they invite and play with friends. This has been especially well-received in markets like Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam, where shopping is a very social affair. 
 These games are all localized to fit the tastes of users in each country. The same game on a Thai customer’s app might look different for people in Indonesia, for instance.

 Social 
 The final key to engagement lies in making shopping a social event. After all, users seem to already have a habit of showing off their purchases to friends and family, so why not move that experience within the app? 
 Enter the Shopee Feed. 
 The function lets users share content about their purchases and listings to the larger Shopee community. Similar to other social media platforms, Shopee Feed allows users to follow and receive real-time updates from their friends, as well as sellers and brands. 
 Another social feature is Shopee Live Chat. It enables direct conversations between buyers and sellers, encouraging quick discussions and clarifications before any transaction occurs. Customized stickers and media-sharing enhancements add to its social aspect. 
 “These conversations are a crucial part of the social experience,” notes Pan. “A whopping 1 million messages were exchanged per hour in 2019, showing how much users crave a social ecommerce experience.” 
 To overcome the language barrier, the firm leverages machine learning and natural language processing to develop real-time translations for the chat feature. This tech, applied in conjunction with local human expertise, helped Shopee build a translation engine that can accurately capture linguistic pairings and even local colloquialisms. 
 A translation model matches two or more languages together, allowing, for example, a Singaporean buyer to send a message in English, and for the Indonesian seller to receive it in Bahasa Indonesia. 
 “In blind  BLEU tests , which are industry-standard tests for machine translations, our engine was found to score higher than leading third-party APIs,” she points out. 
 In a region that speaks at least nine separate languages, helping buyers and sellers understand each other is paramount. “This allows for smoother interactions when users shop for overseas products on Shopee,” says Zhou Junjie, the company’s chief commercial officer.

 Putting everything together 
 Beyond individual initiatives, Shopee has also introduced a livestreaming component called Shopee Live. This feature has enabled brands and sellers to better reach and engage users across the region, and it has scaled rapidly, with more than 1 million hours of content streamed in Q4 2019. 
 Local celebrities have been brought in to increase user adoption, engaging in a variety of live performances. These include talk shows with guests such as Taiwanese singer-actress Rainie Yang, among others. 
 With the internet economy expected to hit  US$300 billion by 2025 , ecommerce players will no doubt expand on their data and technology efforts to create an even more engaging shopping experience for customers. 
 “We believe that online shopping is already constantly evolving to cater to the digital lifestyles of a population that is becoming more connected and mobile,” says Zhou. “There is a need for more meaningful interactions.”

650555,Lazada appoints a new CEO," Alibaba’s Lazada has named Chun Li as its new group chief executive officer, taking over from current CEO Pierre Poignant. 
 Li has been described as the “chief architect” behind Lazada’s technology platform and organizational transformation in 2017. He became its Indonesia CEO in July 2019. Before joining Lazada, he was the chief technology officer of Alibaba’s business-to-business unit. 
  “Chun is an experienced business leader who can realize Lazada’s vision of unifying commerce with technology to advance Southeast Asia’s digital economy,” said Lucy Peng, Lazada group chairwoman. Peng herself  briefly  took on the role of Lazada CEO in 2018.

 Poignant is stepping down after just a year and seven months in the Lazada hot seat. In a C-suite switch-up, he’s set to become a special assistant to Daniel Zhang, Alibaba Group’s chairman and CEO. 
 “Under Pierre’s leadership, Lazada has delivered healthy growth over the past two years,” said Peng in a statement. “We are deeply grateful to Pierre for his invaluable contributions in building the solid foundation for Lazada’s long-term sustainable success.” 
 Lazada Logistics CEO James Sullivan has also stepped down. His stint ended in April this year, as stated in his Linkedin profile. 
 The announcement comes amid constant changes and internal unhappiness toward Lazada’s management, as Reuters and The Wall Street Journal reported separately. 
 In a company email obtained by  Tech in Asia  from an anonymous source, Peng said that Lazada “delivered excellent results” in the first quarter of its new fiscal year. 
 Shopee and Lazada have been locked in a battle to be Southeast Asia’s leading ecommerce marketplace. While Lazada has grown its user base, Shopee pulled ahead in terms of monthly active users in the middle of last year, according to estimates from an industry source. 
 In a statement, Lazada said it has served over 70 million unique consumers in six countries for the 12 months that ended on March 31, 2020. The company added that it gained market share in Indonesia. During the same period, its orders in the country grew over 170% year-on-year, outpacing the competition. 
  Here’s Peng’s email in full:  
 The first quarter of our new fiscal year is coming to an end. Thank you for your fighting spirit and unwavering focus on creating value for our merchants, partners and consumers. Together, we have delivered excellent results. 
 In order to embrace the future, we must continually recalibrate our organization to meet the ever-changing business landscape and needs of customers. Today, I am pleased to announce that Chun Li will succeed Pierre Poignant as the new Group CEO of Lazada, with effect on 1 July. 
 I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Pierre for his invaluable contribution over the years. As a member of Lazada’s founding team, Pierre has consistently led by example, always focused on the big picture and incredibly hardworking. He showed all of us what it means to be a true leader. Under his leadership, Lazada has delivered remarkable progress. More importantly, Pierre has facilitated a seamless integration of Alibaba and Lazada business operations; unified a multicultural team from a wide range of backgrounds; and built a solid bench of talent. Moving forward, Pierre will take on a new role as special assistant to Alibaba Group Chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang. He will continue to support Lazada in his new role. Please join me in congratulating Pierre. 
 Chun has made high impact contributions to Lazada since joining in 2017. He led a joint team of Lazadians and Alirens to complete the far-reaching Voyager project that has transformed and elevated Lazada’s technology infrastructure. Since his appointment as CEO of Lazada Indonesia in July 2019, he has lifted the local business to new heights and demonstrated an ability to win tough battles in a highly competitive landscape. 
 The fundamental shift in global business environment as a result of Covid-19 has created new expectations for Lazada in how to better serve our customers and create value. Under Chun’s leadership, I believe we will broaden our horizons and further leverage our technology to enhance overall product experience and create new value for users, ultimately winning our customers’ trust and confidence. 
 Over the years, the Lazada team has never shied away from challenges and always innovating in our drive to develop eCommerce in Southeast Asia. I hope we will continue to maintain that same passion. We also need to recognize that there remains a long road ahead in optimizing the overall design of our business, integration of our logistics and improving operational efficiencies. 
 Change is the only constant. Lazada’s core asset is our young team of local talents who are deeply rooted in Southeast Asia. As we continue to empower our business partners, we also hope to help all of our Lazada colleagues, especially young local talents, to grow professionally and personally. We eagerly look forward to seeing more local talents with creativity and ambition to rise to the top! 
 Believing is seeing. Onwards and forward, Lazadians!

  Here is Poignant’s letter in full:  
 Dear Lazadians, 
 Thank you for joining me in this journey for the past 8 years. It has been an incredible one. I will remain part of Alibaba big family so you will certainly still hear from me. 
 I joined Lazada co-founders team 8 years ago with a big dream. It was a fantastic journey of building Southeast Asia’s first ecommerce and setting up the ecosystem in the fastest growing region. From mini warehouses &amp; a few to having one of the largest fleet of deliveries in six countries with first and best in class crossborder operations. We make the region grow faster than anyone predicted, enabling small businesses to prosper through selling online, buyers from anywhere can access goods they never had before. 
 I learnt so much from everyone, all of you. It was never easy, but Lazadians have always been resilient. I am eternally grateful for the journey and for you being alongside with me. Lazada will continue to embrace the challenges, the change and seize the opportunities to grow in our journey. 
 I want to thank Daniel Zhang, Lucy and all the Lazadians for your strongest support all these years. Without you, I will not be who I am today. I trust you are in the great hands of Chun. He has accomplished outstanding milestones, starting with Project Voyager, then as Indonesia CEO. With Chun helming Lazada, I am fully confident that Lazada’s competitive advantage in technology and logistics will be fully realised as we forge ahead to overtake competitors. 
 Thank you for your support and hardwork. Lazada is forever in my heart. Once a Lazadian, always a Lazadian. 
 All the best, 
Pierre Poignant 
  Here’s Chun Li’s email in full:  
 Dear Lazadians, 
 Following Lucy’s and Pierre’s email regarding our latest leadership change, I am honoured to be entrusted as the next captain of our Lazada team while continue leading our Indonesia business. 
 I’d like to thank Pierre for his immense contribution to Lazada over the years. Lazada owes a big thank you to Pierre, I have no doubt that he will continue to make his mark in his new role. 
 I am excited about this opportunity to lead Lazada into the next chapter of our journey, and would like to share some thoughts with you about the road ahead. I truly believe that we are well positioned in Southeast Asia to take advantage of the great opportunities in this evolving digital economy. We can make meaningful contribution to the ecosystem through our technology innovation and logistics infrastructure. 
 Over the past three years, at the regional and country level as well as on the technology and business fronts, I had a full view of both the enormous opportunities as well as challenges facing us. To continue building on our growth momentum, we need a consistent and common strategy to guide our major businesses. We will double down on our technology investment in this region – our tech prowess is and will remain our key competitive advantage. We will sharpen our focus on creating value for our brands and sellers, and bringing the best experience to our customers. With a customer-first mindset, we will strategize better, work smarter and fight harder. 
 I am fully committed to growing and incubating our young local talents to take up bigger responsibilities and leadership roles. We have a strong core team and the best talents in SEA. I am confident we can rise to the challenges and seized the opportunities, I count on your support to overtake the competitors and win this battle. 
 I look forward to working closely with you as we forge ahead. The battle will be fierce but we are ready!

650524,East Ventures seeks $88m for post-pandemic startup fund," Early-stage VC firm  East Ventures  announced it has reached the first close of its new seed fund for companies aiming to transform the region’s post-lockdown landscape. 
 (Disclosure: East Ventures is an investor in  Tech in Asia .)

 The company said it looks to raise no more than US$88 million for the new fund, which is its eighth investment vehicle to date. 
 The capital is being raised from institutional investors, global funds, and family offices, according to a statement. East Ventures said its latest fund has already attracted global and regional institutional investors, including Pavilion Capital and Adams Street Partners. 
 “The pandemic has created a chance for a new breed of entrepreneurs to think about new problems and how to solve them in efficient ways via technology,” said East Ventures’ managing partner and co-founder Willson Cuaca. 
 Cuaca added that the company remains optimistic about the future of the digital economy in Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia, despite the current situation. 
 East Ventures said it will also work closely with its existing portfolio companies to advise startups during the crisis. 
 “We realized that the majority of our CEOs have never been in crisis before,” Cuaca noted. This has led the company to do regular health checks with its portfolio firms to gauge how severely the Covid-19 pandemic has affected their businesses. 
 “Only after founders understand these things can they begin to cultivate their own strategy and implement it tactically,” Cuaca added. 
 Since being founded in 2009, East Ventures has already supported more than 170 startups in the region that are present across Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. 
 The company is one of the first investors in now Indonesian unicorns Tokopedia and Traveloka. Other notable companies in its portfolio include Ruangguru, Warung Pintar, Fore Coffee, ShopBack, CoHive, and Koinworks.

650512,SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son to step down from Alibaba’s board," SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son said today that he will be leaving the board of Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group after holding the position for nearly 15 years. 
 The announcement comes a month after Ma formally  stepped down  from SoftBank’s board of directors, a position he had held for 13 years.

 Son made the announcement during SoftBank’s annual general meeting of shareholders, assuring them that the move was not a result of any disagreement. He also said he plans to continue serving as SoftBank’s CEO for the next seven to eight years. 
 During the meeting, Son noted that the equity value of SoftBank’s assets had returned to pre-Covid-19 numbers. The rebound is partly due to an increase in the company’s Alibaba shareholding. 
 In its May earnings release, SoftBank reported an operating loss of around  US$13 billion  for full-year 2019, falling by US$31.7 billion year on year. 
 The result was pulled down by a US$17.7 billion loss on valuation from investments held by its Vision Fund. As of the fiscal year-end, SoftBank had US$75 billion in investments across 88 companies that are worth US$69.6 billion. 
 SoftBank said the fair values of its big-ticket bets Uber and WeWork, as well as its other portfolio companies, dove during the fourth fiscal quarter primarily due to the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 However, the tech investor said during today’s meeting that the demand brought by Covid-19 has boosted the value of Vision Fund’s investments in Chinese firms, which include the healthtech startup Ping An Good Doctor and TikTok operator ByteDance.

650309,Powering sustainable ports with emerging tech," Container ports are an essential part of international trade. From cars to laptops and everything in between, many of the things we use in our daily lives made their way to us by water, transported in a shipping container. 
 The scale of the shipping industry is staggering: about  90% of all consumer goods  travel by ship, and in 2017,  1.83 billion tonnes  of goods were shipped by container. 
 However, sustainability is a huge concern. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), which is responsible for regulating shipping activities, is making a concerted push toward making shipping  more environmentally friendly , in line with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. 
 Shipping as an industry accounts for  3% of global carbon emissions  at present, and if changes aren’t made, that number is set to rise  to anywhere between 50% and 250%  by 2050. 
 Container ports, in particular, contribute a significant amount to the shipping industry’s carbon footprint. In 2011, shipping emissions from ports were responsible for  18 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions  – equivalent to that of nearly four million passenger cars. 
 While shipping companies are taking steps to  make their vessels and processes greener  in the wake of  new environmental regulations  issued by IMO, countries are also working toward reducing the environmental impact of their ports. 
 One solution that some cities are implementing is the development of smart ports. Much like smart cities, smart ports make use of emerging technologies in order to work more efficiently and sustainably. 
 Reducing the carbon footprint 
 “Smart ports focus on two things: decarbonization and increasing operational efficiency,” explains Sylvie Ouziel, international president at  Envision Digital , a global provider of AI-driven IoT technologies.

  Decarbonization  refers to reducing or eliminating the amount of carbon dioxide produced when generating power by tapping into renewable sources of energy. 
 Ports are an ecosystem unto themselves. They have complex anchorage and docking systems, as well as a network of forklifts, cranes, and other machinery required to transport containers within the port. 
 Ports also require a large amount of energy not just to run their operations but also to provide power to the rigs and ships that they host, making decarbonization especially important. 
 Many countries have begun embarking on smart, sustainable port projects. For instance, Qatar launched its  sustainable mega port development  in 2016, and in 2017, a  Ship Emission Management System  was rolled out in Johor, Malaysia to monitor carbon emissions from ships docked in its waters. 
 In Singapore, Envision Digital is  working with PSA Singapore , one of the nation’s main port operators, to develop smart ports in the country. 
 Green power 
 These smart ports will make use of AI and IoT to help streamline its operations and reduce its carbon footprint in a bid to be more sustainable and efficient. Envision Digital refers to the combination of the two technologies as AIoT. 
 “When it comes to energy, AIoT can detect energy waste such as unnecessary lighting or inefficient machinery cooling systems, and adjust system parameters accordingly,” Ouziel explains. 
 What this means is that the system will essentially be “self-fixing” and can address any abnormalities or inefficiencies on its own, ensuring that power is used only where it is needed. 
 AI and IoT can also help drive the use of renewable energy in smart ports.

 “Some Asian ports are currently deploying solar panels and other green energy solutions,” Ouziel says. “AI can inform the system with high-resolution high-accuracy weather forecast in order to a​nticipate the demand and supply of intermittent electricity.” 
 Intermittent electricity refers to renewable sources of energy, such as solar or wind, which vary in their availability based on external conditions. By examining weather patterns, AI and IoT can determine how much electricity such renewable sources can generate, and help ports determine how much energy they would need from different sources. 
 These systems can also help optimize electricity consumption. For example, if the solar panels generate more electricity than is needed on a sunny day, the excess can be stored for use at night. 
 AI and IoT also have an important role to play in optimizing the different machines used in container handling at ports. 
 “Cranes, forklifts, and other machines can exchange information in real time regarding their location and status so that the most suitable equipment is deployed with the least cost and energy consumption,” Ouziel explains. 
 The use of such technology is more efficient than centralized planning, as it allows multiple machines belonging to different operators to exchange information while on the move. This helps cut down the port’s carbon emissions while ensuring that vehicles are deployed effectively. 
 These smart ports will also make use of  remote cranes and automated guided vehicles  powered by similar AI and IoT technologies in its operations to reduce manpower and increase operational efficiency. 
 Beyond sustainability and efficiency, AIoT can also improve port safety. 
 “AI enables the use of real-time image analysis to detect dangerous situations, such as the removal of a safety barrier, and can be complemented with other kinds of IoT devices such as sensors,” says Ouziel. 
 Smart ports: an inevitability 
 The use of AIoT in smart ports will go a long way in reducing their environmental impact. Ouziel estimates that through smart consumption, renewable energy, and more efficient processes, ports can reduce their carbon footprint by 20%. 
 As container shipping is set to  continue to grow  and remain a key part of trade for the foreseeable future, building sustainable smart ports is the way forward. 
 While there are  many difficulties  in making shipping sustainable, such as the  high capital investments  required for smart ports and the training required to use new technologies, Ouziel is confident that cities will be able to rise to the challenge. 
 “When it comes to the question of whether ports can be fully sustainable, it’s a matter of when, not if.”

650440,Ovo-Dana merger could be Indonesia’s most ambitious crossover event," The merger of Indonesia-based mobile payment services Ovo and Dana, which is reported to be in its final stages, would be the most concrete step toward a duopoly in the country’s digital payments landscape. But its implications could be even larger. 
 The much-anticipated move would thicken the battle lines between two coalitions, each a sprawling web of tech giants, massive family conglomerates, and popular consumer apps. It’s also a key chapter in a wider battle stretching across ecommerce, fintech, healthcare, and media, with Alibaba and Softbank on one side and Tencent, JD, and Facebook on the other.

 The prize? The wallets and data of tens of millions of Indonesian consumers. To borrow the  meme , this could be the most ambitious crossover event in the country. 
 Mobile payments is the key to connecting disparate industries, easing transactions, and collecting data on Indonesian consumers. But who has the edge on this front? 
 The narrative was that Ovo was the strongest offline – thanks to backer Lippo Group’s network of malls and hospitals – while the Gojek ecosystem gave GoPay a foothold online. But this isn’t the case anymore – Ovo’s online presence has been bolstered by its partnerships with Grab and Tokopedia. 
   ﻿   
  This chart is interactive. Pinch/scroll to zoom in and out. Drag to pan. Click/tap on data points to view more details. Best viewed on desktop.  
 Meanwhile, GoPay stands to benefit from its  recent funding round , which saw investment from PayPal and Facebook. The latter also plans to move into ecommerce and payments to tap into its strong user base in Indonesia. 
 While the merger has not yet been finalized – largely due to regulatory issues – it appears that a duopoly (and the mergers needed to get there) will happen sooner or later. 
 A powerful combo? 
 An Ovo-Dana merger could present a united front. Multiple third-party research reports identify GoPay or Ovo as the current market leaders in Indonesia’s e-wallet space. But based on  Bank Indonesia data  viewed by  Tech in Asia  last September, Ovo accounted for 37% of total digital payment transaction values in the first six months of 2019. Assuming that the figures still hold true, Ovo-Dana would represent almost half of transaction values in the country at 47%, or US$1.86 billion. 
    
     
 Gojek disputes these figures, however. While Bank Indonesia’s methodology was not disclosed, the numbers appear to be self-reported by each company and submitted regularly to the regulator for oversight purposes. 
 Another way to examine the coalitions would be to analyze the popular platforms under their belts and their respective user bases in Indonesia: 
    
     
 Based on the table above,  Tech in Asia  took a look at third-party estimates on user time spent on platforms aligned with GoPay, Ovo, and Dana in 2020. Those numbers show an overwhelming advantage for the Ovo-Dana alliance, which benefits from three ecommerce platforms: Tokopedia, Bukalapak, and Lazada. 
    
     
 GoPay’s ecommerce partners, on the other hand, are chiefly smaller ones like JD.id, Blibli, and Tiket.com. The Gojek app remains the one asset with the biggest time spent figures by comparison. 
 Conserving fuel 
 A merger would allow Ovo and Dana to concentrate their firepower on GoPay instead of on each other, says an industry analyst. As a whole, it may also lead to less aggressive marketing initiatives like cashbacks, subsidies, and discounts. 
 Fundamentally, while promotions are a costly strategy that may be essential during an e-wallet’s first phase of expansion, it’s not as “well-supported” now, says one VC, especially after Covid-19 and the increasing emphasis on profitability. 
 “[There] would be a bit more targeted promotions. You won’t see blanket 50% discounts anymore,” he says.

 The VC points out that after being “quite aggressive” with promotions early on, GoPay and Ovo have dialed things back. Typically, the entrance of new players in an industry will create a  barrage and counter-barrage of promotions , which was true when Dana and ShopeePay first entered the market. So the fewer new players there are, the better it is for the incumbents. 
 At the same time, it’ll be challenging for a smaller player – even at Dana’s scale – to raise funding in order to go up against GoPay and Ovo. Tough funding environments, such as the current climate, tend to favor larger companies rather than startups,  Tech in Asia ’s data  shows . 
 “It’s a hard sell [to investors] in this environment, especially for an economies-of-scale business model which can be very costly,” the VC says, adding that players will be encouraged to merge as a result. 
 Mix and match 
 A Dana-Ovo alliance would bring complementary pieces together. 
 While Ovo had a head start offline with the merchants in Lippo Group’s malls and hospitals, it has since built a strong online presence through partnerships with Grab and Tokopedia. Now, that will be compounded with Dana’s presence on Bukalapak, Lazada, and Tix ID. 
 Dana’s affiliation with Emtek, a media conglomerate, may also lead to a boost in media coverage for the merged company, says the former CEO of an Indonesian ecommerce platform. Emtek owns multiple TV channels, movie studios, and online publications, and one of its subsidiaries is Tix ID, a movie ticketing platform that is also a Dana partner.

 Similarly, GoPay may have started out stronger online thanks to the Gojek ecosystem, but it’s also available as a payment option for offline merchants – especially GoFood partners. 
 Gojek’s recent acquisition of Moka may give GoPay even more of an edge offline, says the VC that  Tech in Asia  spoke to. Still, the acquisition happened only recently, so it’s too early to tell what Moka can bring to the table (aside from big data and perhaps a financial services play). 
 Moka’s scale – it claims to have  40,000 merchants  – also doesn’t match up to Lippo or Emtek, both of which are conglomerates controlling billions of US dollars in assets. Most importantly, it is not exclusive to GoPay, as Moka supports Ovo as a payment option, along with Dana and other e-wallets. 
 GoPay’s secret weapon? 
 Even though Ovo and Dana may seem to have an upper hand in online reach, the dust has hardly settled. 
 What could  make a big difference  for Gojek is the recent investment it received from PayPal and especially Facebook. WhatsApp is the dominant chat app in Indonesia, and its potential use case is reminiscent of WeChat Pay, whose parent firm Tencent is also an investor in Gojek. 
 An integration with WhatsApp can make it “very convenient to send money to your circles of friends and families,” says a former ecommerce CEO. “[It’s a] less commercial, more social use case.” 
 The amount of time people spend on Facebook’s family of apps versus local platforms just shows the advantage Gojek can potentially gain. 
    
     
 Other than peer-to-peer money transfers, Facebook can also pursue deeper integrations between WhatsApp and the Gojek ecosystem, as we’ve  written about  before. In India, for instance, the social media giant is hoping to position WhatsApp as a way for local mom and pop shops to purchase wholesale goods. 
 But more than WhatsApp, the commerce use case may be most apparent with Facebook and Instagram, which also enjoy large user bases in the country. Gojek stands to benefit from both platforms’ new “Shops” features, which would allow users to complete their purchases without having to leave the apps. 
 With the recent investment, Gojek can expect certain advantages from being part of Facebook’s portfolio. However, several VCs doubt that the collaboration will be exclusive – it seems more likely that Facebook will add Ovo and other GoPay competitors as payment options. 
 As such, the Facebook investment may still be a wild card in terms of how it will actually benefit Gojek, at least for the moment. Still, if the tie-up can bring just 10% of Facebook and Instagram’s Indonesian users onto GoPay (assuming they aren’t GoPay users already) it would amount to 18 million people – more than half of Gojek’s entire monthly active users in the country. 
 Keep an eye on Shopee and Traveloka 
 Looking at the duopoly’s alliances and relationships, two prominent names are missing: Shopee and Traveloka. Both companies have so far stayed out of the fray – neither offers GoPay, Ovo, or Dana as payment options on their platforms. 
 But that doesn’t mean they’re not in the digital payments race. Traveloka has TravelokaPay, a feature developed in partnership with the e-wallet Uangku (backed by the Indonesian telecommunications company Smartfren), while it has also branched out into co-branded credit cards with state-owned Bank Mandiri. 
 While TravelokaPay so far can only be used within Traveloka itself, Shopee seems to have bigger ambitions for its ShopeePay e-wallet. Aside from the company’s own marketplace – which appears to be  Indonesia’s largest ecommerce platform by gross merchandise value  – it’s already available at several offline merchants including McDonald’s and Kopi Kenangan (though not exclusively) and is offering promotional cashbacks and discounts. 
 From the looks of it, Shopee is the 800-pound gorilla in the sector, with its share of time spent in 2020 appearing to surpass that of all the other major ecommerce platforms and super apps. 
    
     
 Traveloka is not seeing numbers at a similar scale, partly as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. But it’s worth noting that it is still significantly larger than competitor Tiket.com, which is aligned with GoPay. Plus, travel products presumably have larger average basket sizes, as Meituan-Dianping  demonstrated  in China. 
 For now, it’s unclear why neither player has aligned with GoPay or Ovo-Dana or whether there are plans to do so in the future (a Shopee spokesperson declined to comment, while Traveloka has not provided a comment at publication). 
 But Shopee and Traveloka’s backers may offer some clues on where their allegiances lie. The former’s parent firm Sea Group, for instance, counts Tencent as one of it’s key investors – Tencent, of course, is affiliated with Gojek. 
 Meanwhile, Traveloka may have reason to align with Gojek as well, being backed by global travel giant Expedia Group, whose main rival, Booking Holdings, invested in Grab in 2018. Grab has a hotel-booking feature on its app that directs users to Oyo, Agoda, and Booking.com. 
 Blockage on the highway 
 For SoftBank, the creation of its complicated coalition in Indonesia is deliberate at least. It’s  widely known  that the firm wants its investees, especially those backed by the Vision Fund, to form a “keiretsu” – a Japanese term for a web of corporations that not only own stakes in each other but also help out their partner companies. 
 That’s easier said than done, however. Firms within a  keiretsu  possess differing interests, battling egos, and conflicting cultures, all of which could prevent cooperation. 
 Another hurdle that any coalition will need to clear is regulations. In the case of Ovo and Dana, the most recent merger at a somewhat comparable scale would be Grab and Uber in Southeast Asia, which did not enjoy a smooth regulatory process.

 Indonesia’s anti-competition body (KPPU) may also determine “anti-competitiveness” through the degree of market concentration as well as barriers to entry, an analyst points out. But Joel Shen, a partner at international law firm DWF, says that this would not really be an issue. 
 “Depending on who you ask, the Grab-Uber merger was either a masterful display of shrewd M&amp;A strategy or a case study on how not to run a merger,” he says. While the merger was eventually completed, it also resulted in penalties, including a  US$9.5 million fine  from Singapore’s competition regulator. 
 Shen – whose clients include Grab and Ant Financial – points out, however, that Indonesian regulations do not prohibit substantial mergers or consolidations per se – only those that result in a monopoly and/or unfair competition. 
 So far, there has been no evidence that a tie-up between Dana and Ovo will be anti-competitive, Shen explains. Additionally, while filing mergers in Indonesia is compulsory, it’s usually done post-merger and is non-suspensory in nature. 
 Compared to ride-hailing, “there is a more diverse mix of competitors” in payments, says Shen. Uber’s exit from Singapore, for instance, resulted in the market being dominated by a single operator. 
 Rather than KPPU, Bank Indonesia – Indonesia’s central bank – will likely prove to be the more difficult gatekeeper, he says. After all, Bank Indonesia prohibits any single entity from having a controlling interest in more than one licensed e-money issuer. However, the companies behind Ovo and Dana both possess one e-money license each, which means that a merger would require special dispensation from Bank Indonesia.

 “If Dana and Ovo are unable to obtain such dispensation, then any plans for a merger will have fallen at the first hurdle,” Shen adds. “I don’t think Ovo and Dana will be able to blindside the regulators in the same way that Grab and Uber did because of the way the payments regulatory framework is set up and administered by Bank Indonesia.” 
 A fintech executive who is in the process of getting approval for “payment integration” from the central bank says that the entity is “conventional” and “slow” compared to OJK, the country’s financial services authority. 
 “They’re so reluctant in giving permission to new business models because of legal, security, and financial issues,” she says, adding that Facebook’s idea of WhatsApp Pay may likely face the same hurdle. 
 Should the merger fall through at the last minute, it seems likely that the status quo – and cash burn, to an extent – would continue, especially when the incumbents face newcomers like ShopeePay. 
 With so much at stake, it seems consolidation and a move toward a duopoly will still happen at some point. Without the merger, it will just take longer.

650439,Tencent buys Southeast Asian streaming platform Iflix," Chinese entertainment titan Tencent said it has purchased Southeast Asian streaming service  Iflix  to extend the reach of its own streaming platform WeTV into the region. 
 Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.

 “Through the purchase, WeTV will further extend our presence in the video-streaming industry across Southeast Asia to reach a broader audience base within the region and to better serve our users with a better viewing experience,” the company told  Tech in Asia  in an emailed statement .  
 WeTV, which is operated by Tencent Video, was launched first in Thailand last year, offering original Chinese content with Thai dubbing and other content made with local partners. The service has also been made available in Indonesia and the Philippines. Tencent declined to disclose the platform’s operating metrics. 
 With the purchase, which includes Iflix’s content, technology, and resources, Iflix’s local network across emerging markets will give WeTV’s current users a wider range of international, local, and original content, Tencent said.

 The company also said that most of Iflix’s current staff, including CEO Marc Barnett, will retain their roles. “Our current priority is to ensure smooth integration with our existing business and also talent retention.” 
 Iflix, founded in 2014, competes with Netflix in the region, serving users in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Brunei, the Maldives, Pakistan, Myanmar, Cambodia, Nepal, and Bangladesh. 
 As of April 2020, it had upwards of 25 million monthly active users on its platform. 
 It was reported earlier this month that a number of Chinese tech firms have been considering a takeover of the Malaysia-based streaming service, which was exploring a sale to avoid financial distress. Citing people familiar with the business,  Campaign  reported that the company had burned through its remaining cash a few months ago. 
 To date, Iflix has raised a total of  US$348 million  in funding. Its latest round came in July last year when it banked US$50 million ahead of a potential IPO. The company was reportedly looking into going public in Australia this year, but later shelved its plans as it looked to raise more funding. 
 In May, two principals from investment fund Mandala Asset Solutions, which provides advisory services for “distressed assets,” joined the company’s board of directors. The appointments followed the exits of Iflix co-founders Luke Elliott and Patrick Grove from the company’s board.

650387,BRI Ventures launches new tech fund for Indonesian startups,"  BRI Ventures , a corporate VC firm under Indonesia’s state-owned Bank BRI, today announced it has launched a new tech fund that’s  targeting to secure US$21.2 million for its first close.  
 Called Sembrani Nusantara, which means “unicorn archipelago,” the fund will invest in Indonesia-based companies operating in education, agro-maritime, retail, transportation, and healthcare sectors, according to a statement. 
 With over US$250 million in assets under management, BRI Ventures has made several investments in the fintech sector, including bill aggregator Ayopop, e-wallet LinkAja, and peer-to-peer financing platform Modalku, among others.

 With a “value over valuation” philosophy and the continuing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the new fund will focus on companies that can survive in times of crisis. 
 Over the past three or four months, many Indonesian startups have either laid off employees or resized their business to weather the Covid-19 crisis. Most recently, ride-hailing unicorn Gojek announced that it’s  letting go of 430 employees  or 9% of its staff as part of its “long-term response” to the pandemic. 
 Some startups, like budget hotel aggregator  Airy  and food logistics startup  Stoqo , unfortunately had to shut down. 
 According to a  recent survey by KPMG , VC firms will evaluate deals more closely amid the crisis, factoring in the stability and flexibility of supply chain, anticipated product or service demand, workforce management practices, use of advanced tech, and customer retention practices. 
 “At the end of the day, what is important is that startups have good business fundamentals from day one and are able to create real value in the local economy,” BRI Ventures said in the statement. 
 The launch of Sembrani Nusantara, which is locally incorporated and licensed by Indonesia’s financial services authority (OJK), is quite significant for the country, the firm said. 
 In the past, setting up a locally incorporated venture fund wasn’t a viable option due to reasons such as taxation. To date, all the VC firms operating in the archipelago are incorporated offshore, mostly in Singapore, or invested off the balance sheet of their parent company, BRI Ventures explained.

650216,Scooter-sharing startup WeMo scores series A money in AppWorks-led round,"  WeMo Scooter , a Taiwanese e-scooter sharing startup, has closed its “multimillion-dollar” series A funding round led by regional accelerator and early-stage VC AppWorks.

 With the new funds, WeMo looks to continue extending the reach of its services in key cities across Taiwan. 
 It also aims to start laying the foundation for its regional expansion plans by bolstering its research and development center on the island. Over the next three years, the center looks to hire 100 engineers for roles such as front-end and back-end development, self-driving technology, vehicle telematics, and machine learning. 
 According to WeMo CEO Jeffrey Wu, the company is planning several more projects for different parts of Asia. 
  What problem is it solving?  There are currently 14 million motorcycles plying the streets of Taiwan, said a spokesperson for WeMo .  “However, each motorcycle is only used for less than 40 minutes per day on average,” the spokesperson said, adding that the exhaust from these vehicles is responsible for a huge amount of pollution in the city. 
 Like other smart mobility companies, WeMo aims to reduce air pollution while giving its customers a convenient and personalized mode of transportation without having to own a vehicle. 
 The startup, however, also boasts the use of “internet of vehicles” (IoV) and big data analytics. IoV is a network that supports the exchange of information collected from infotainment systems, sensors, and GPS units between connected vehicles. 
 With these technologies, the company is able to provide convenient features such as digital ID verification and a “quick ride” function, which lets users search for and start using the nearest unused e-scooter through its app. 
  What’s the opportunity?  The global scooter-sharing market is predicted to grow to US$553 million by 2025, up from just US$99.8 million in 2018, according to Research and Markets. 
 During the forecast period, the market’s growth in Asia Pacific is expected to be the most rapid, mainly due to the high adoption of shared scooters in Taiwan and China. 
 In Taiwan, WeMo competes with iRent, a service run by Toyota’s local sales agent Hotai Motor Group, and GoShare, which is operated by the island’s largest e-motorcycle brand Gogoro. 
 WeMo sets itself apart by being the only provider that develops its own technology. It also invests in IoV solutions to improve user experience and acts as a platform for future smart city applications. 
 According to Wu, WeMo has managed to continue its growth in Taiwan even after competitors entered the market. However, the CEO declined to disclose specific information, saying it may give away “too much competitive intelligence” to its peers. 
  What are its challenges?  Up until late 2018, WeMo was the only provider in Taiwan investing in IoV technology and e-motorcycle sharing, said Wu. 
 Now that the competition in the local market has increased, proving its business model, staying ahead of the game, and improving upon its platform’s user experience have been part of the company’s daily routine. 
 “We are glad now to have AppWorks along our side, not only as a mentor from the AppWorks Accelerator program, but as investors to back our smart transportation vision,” Wu said. 
 The startup joined AppWorks Accelerator’s 12th cohort in 2016 to jumpstart its traction. With the latest funding round, WeMo has become AppWorks’ first investment into Taiwan’s smart mobility sector. 
 WeMo’s funding also comes at a time when other mobility companies, such as US-based firms Lime and Bird, announced layoffs in response to lowering demand amid the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Due to Taiwan’s “superb” response to the global crisis, Wu said the startup was not heavily affected by the pandemic. 
  How much traction is it targeting?  Since its establishment in 2016, the startup has expanded its fleet to more than 6,000 vehicles to serve three cities in Taiwan. 
 For 2020, the company said it aims to have more than 700,000 registered users in its database to complete upwards of 10 million rides. 
  Who are the team members?  WeMo’s senior management team consists of Wu, chief technology officer Jay Cheng, chief marketing officer Joni Yang, and operations director Johnny Chiang. 
 They each have more than 10 years of experience ranging from strategy consulting, telematics and connectivity manufacturing, brand and digital marketing, and logistics and delivery services. The group currently leads WeMo’s over 250 employees.

650321,Singapore’s Shiok Meats bags $3m in bridge funding ahead of series A," Singapore-based foodtech startup  Shiok Meats  said it has raised US$3 million in a bridge funding round from Agronomics, US-based VegInvest, UK-based Impact Venture, and UAE-headquartered Mindshift Capital Fund, securing a total of US$7.6 million in funding to date.

 Founded in 2018, Shiok Meats produces lab-grown seafood meat such as shrimp, claiming to be the first cell-based meat company in Southeast Asia. 
  See:  These scientists aim to make cell-grown shrimp and crab meat a commercial reality   
 The startup will use the new funds to set up its first manufacturing plant in Singapore as it looks to commercialize its business in the next two to three years. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  Investors from Europe and the US have shown great interest in foodtech startups creating cell-based meat. In Asia, investors, particularly angels and smaller VCs, are slowly showing interest. Larger VCs are still “very risk-averse,” though, Shiok Meats CEO and co-founder Sandhya Sriram told  Tech in Asia . 
 This type of challenge is evident in the space. Carrie Chan, CEO and co-founder of cell-based protein provider Avant Meats, told  Tech in Asia  in an  earlier interview  that companies like hers have to be “patient for capital to roll in.” It may also take a year to commercially launch its products. 
 According to a study by the Good Food Institute, cell-based meat companies globally have collected  US$73.7 million  from 70 investors across 22 deals as of 2018. Despite its rapid growth, the sector is still in nascent stage as the investments represent only 6% of those made in plant-based food industry and 0.5% in foodtech. 
 Sriram also expects that it may take years to set pricing for a mass market as it’s a novel technology, as reducing cost is another challenge faced by many cultivated meat producers. The chief exec said in a recent  interview  with the  South China Morning Post  that Shiok Meats aims to bring down the cost of producing a kilogram of lab-grown shrimp meat to US$50 from the current US$5,000. 
  What are its future plans?  Currently, the company is still in the pre-revenue, research and development phase. It looks to create more prototypes with its cell-based shrimp meat moving forward. 
 Shiok Meats previously revealed that it’s aiming to sell its first product – a dumpling made with cell-based shrimp – in Singapore by 2021. It’s also eyeing expansion in Hong Kong, India, and Australia. 
 For now, the startup is working to close its series A round by the end of this year, Sriram said. 
  What is its funding history?  
 
 
 Seed round  (2019): US$4.6 million from Monde Nissin CEO Henry Soesanto (lead), Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, AiiM Partners Fund, Big Idea Ventures, AeraVC, Beyond Impact Ventures, Boom Capital, Twynam Investments, and some angel investors

650335,Can Tencent’s Joox beat Spotify in Asia?," After seeing success with its QQ Music streaming service, Tencent was thirsty for more. But rather than just growing within China, the internet giant launched  Joox  in January 2015 in a bid to offer its music services to overseas markets. 
 Within a year of its release, the app  seized majority of the market share  in Hong Kong and Malaysia, which came as a surprise to many. After all, Spotify had already been in both markets since 2013, yet it was knocked off the top spot by a newcomer. 
 
  Like Spotify, Joox is a freemium service that gives its users access to over 30 million songs but certain functions, such as skipping songs ad-free, are reserved for premium users. / Photo credit: 123Rf 
 
 What has helped Joox hit a high note with users is its emphasis on local music. Such content is particularly important in some Asian markets, especially in Thailand and Taiwan, where  40% to 50%  of the most popular singles are in the local language. And Joox provides just that, giving listeners access to millions of songs in Korean, Mandarin, Cantonese, Thai, Indonesian, and Malay. 
 Spotify is no pushover, however. In fact, in terms of active users, it’s maintaining its lead over Joox in key Asian markets, an industry source estimates. 
 Joox has been reinventing itself as a multimedia entertainment app. In 2017, it launched its livestreaming service for Mandopop and K-pop concerts, complete with real-time subtitle translations in local languages, consequently converting thousands of music fans into app users. 
 That same year, it launched its karaoke feature that allows users to record and sing songs with others. Joox tells  Tech in Asia  that the karaoke function has seen “impressive” success: By 2019, users have sung over 10 million songs through the app, with some 20 tracks belted out every minute. 
 Although Joox’s move to widen its offerings has struck a chord with a young demographic, Spotify says that “diversifying into livestreaming concerts is not currently in [its] plans.” Instead, it will be focusing on “building the best-in-class catalogue of original and exclusive podcasts” to become the world’s top audio platform, a company spokesperson says. 
 
  In 2019, an average of 20 karaoke songs were sung per minute on Joox. / Photo credit: Joox 
 
 If Joox’s karaoke feature rings a bell, that’s because Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) started its own karaoke app WeSing in September 2014. But not only does it allow users to sing karaoke, it also lets them share videos and livestreams with friends via Weixin (WeChat) for free. There are some paid features in WeSing that have generated revenue for TME, a growing and profitable Tencent subsidiary that was valued at  around US$21 billion  in 2018. 
 The primary sources of revenue for livestreamers and karaoke singers on WeSing are virtual gifts and coins from their fans. Power users with six-figure follower counts can earn as much as 50,000 yuan (US$7,300) a month in tips during livestreams – and that’s after TME  takes its steep 70% cut  of revenue. 
    
 
 While most of TME’s  800 million user base  is concentrated in its music-streaming apps QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwo, the firm’s biggest revenue sources are its “social entertainment services,” with sales from music-focused livestreams and online karaoke accounting for two-thirds (67.6%) of total revenue. 
 However, TME says that Covid-19 has affected its social entertainment business. Analysts believe that growth will slow down this year due to the pandemic, with revenues expected to  rise by only 18% . 
 With its music-streaming services  still unprofitable , Joox needed to branch out into other revenue streams. Despite stressing that it has “no relationship” with TME other than having the same parent company, Joox launched its version of a coin redemption center in early 2019. 
 
 Similar to how mobile games work, the redemption center allows users to collect up to 17 free Joox coins daily by completing tasks such as singing a karaoke song. The coins can then be exchanged for free VIP membership and access to exclusive music events. Joox says the strategy helps it “gain traction among users” by offering them a way to enjoy the app’s premium features without having to fork out a cent.

 Much like in TME’s music apps, Joox users can swap the coins for online gifts to give to friends or their favorite artists who, in turn, can cash them out. Hardcore fans can buy packages starting from HK$8 (around US$1) for 50 Joox coins. 
 Although Joox declined to reveal its financial numbers “as per company policy,” its rewards system has risen in popularity: The volume of Joox coins that have been given out  has increased by 522%  in the past 12 months, according to Poshu Yeung, vice president of Tencent International Business Group. 
 Joox’s potential revenue 
 Estimates by  Tech in Asia  show that if Joox can keep growing, it could eventually make close to US$13 million per month or US$156 million a year in its existing markets. The estimates are calculated based on metrics from TME, as both firms operate off a similar revenue mix of music subscriptions and sales, advertising, and social entertainment services. 
    
    
 Although TME’s monthly US$258 million figure dwarfs Joox’s, it must be noted that the former’s Chinese market is a lot larger than the latter’s overseas one, which consists of Macau, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Myanmar. 
 Running up against Spotify 
 Joox has had a quick and impressive rise, seizing over 50% of all music-streaming app downloads when it launched in Hong Kong and Malaysia in 2015 and even edging out Spotify, which has been the top app in the category since 2013. 
   
 It then expanded to Indonesia and Thailand in 2016, and continues to be in the race to the top, ranking first or near it in its core markets, according to app analytics firm App Annie. 
 However, “Joox’s growth is not conclusive because this is just a snapshot in time,” explains Junde Yu, vice president of App Annie. “We also need to look at whether new downloads are accelerating and watch for trends in their active user numbers.” 
 
  Note: Apps among music categories on iOS App Store and Google Play. Pre-installed apps (Apple Music, Google Play Music) are excluded. 
 
 Even though it got off to a good start, the road ahead remains long for Joox. Spotify has since regained its top dog status in the music-streaming market in Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Macau, whereas Joox’s user count has been relatively flat in recent months, according to estimates from an industry source. 
 Joox declined to reveal its exact user figures, except to say that it has grown 533% over the past five years. YouTube Music’s entry into Asia last year has also made the space even more competitive. 
 Looking ahead, in order for the company to meet its revenue potential, Joox may need to ramp up marketing spending, find new product growth triggers, or expand to new countries. 
 Lowering the barrier to usage 
 Both Spotify and Joox have been finding ways to make their products more accessible to Asia’s price-sensitive listeners. Launched in June 2019, Spotify Lite offers users in regions with poor internet connectivity a less data-intensive experience, such as speedier and easier installations, while retaining  up to 90%  of the main app’s functions. 
 
  Spotify Lite aims to give users a less data-intensive experience, with nearly all the functions of the full app. / Photo credit: Spotify 
 
 The move is seen as Spotify’s attempt to lower its barrier to usage, as many users  were shunning  its service due to high data charges. 
 Spotify Lite appears to have limited traction compared to the main app, however, clocking only over 10 million Google Play installs compared to Spotify’s 500 million. 
 The Sweden-based firm had also refused to lower its prices for Spotify Premium until December 2019, when it finally caved in and gave  a 50% price cut  in India, as Apple Music and YouTube Music were also offering discounts. 
 Joox, meanwhile, has consistently priced itself at 8% to 16% less than Spotify. It also offers users a longer trial period for its premium services. Although it loses out to its rival app when it comes to the number of tracks available in its music collection, Joox makes up for this with its variety of songs in Asian languages. 
    
 
  Joox also says it’s repositioning itself to better serve advertisers, which bring in around half of its revenue; the other half comes from VIP subscriptions, according to a  previous Tencent Thailand interview  in the  Bangkok Post . 
 Supporting local 
 Joox has been ramping up its efforts to promote local music artists. In March, it launched Joox Originals in Hong Kong and Malaysia to support local talents, and songs released via the platform are exclusive to Joox users. The initiative will be launched in Indonesia and Thailand this year. 
 
  The success of Joox Original’s Malaysian pilot, which promoted local acts such as Hazama &amp; Darmas, has led the firm to expand the platform to Indonesia and Thailand. / Photo credit: Joox 
 
 Apart from this, Joox regularly collaborates with local artists, even inviting them to sing with their fans through its karaoke function. The firm has built up a database of “thousands” of tracks in regional languages such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Thai, Indonesian, and Burmese. 
 Looking to the future, Joox says it’s planning to expand to “other African countries,” specifically Nigeria, which it identifies as the largest music market Africa. This would follow its 2017 expansion to the continent into South Africa. 
 On the revenue front, Joox says that although it has been shifting toward in-app purchases such as its coin redemption feature, subscription remains an important factor to its growth. “In the near future, we will roll out different subscription plans, similar to the family plans that we launched in Q1 2020.”

650329,Livestreaming ecommerce booms in China amid the pandemic," “Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!” 
 That’s the battle call of China’s “King of Lipstick” Jiaqi Li, the livestreaming beauty product salesman who once sold 15,000 tubes of lipstick in just five minutes. 
 Li is part of a rising number of people hawking products on China’s ecommerce and livestreaming platforms. Part-salespeople and part-influencers, they push everything, from Louis Vuitton bags to homegrown oranges – and millions are tuning in to watch. 
 
  Jiaqi Li (center) / Photo credit: Jiaqi Li 
 
 The trend hasn’t quite caught on in other parts of the world: Amazon’s experiments with livestreaming haven’t attracted much attention, while Facebook’s and TikTok’s have only just begun. 
 But in a sense, the concept isn’t new. It’s an evolution of the television shopping channel, which has been tempting (usually elderly) viewers to buy jewelry and fancy knives since the 1980s. 
 Instead of on TV, however, online salespeople hawk their wares on livestreaming services. These platforms have grown exponentially in China, as online penetration booms and viewers search for content that’s more exciting than what the risk-averse and government-controlled TV networks broadcast. 
 And then the pandemic struck. 
 Covid-19 paralyzed the country, leaving many industries struggling – but not livestreaming. With shops closed and people stuck at home with little to do, livestreaming ecommerce is expected to grow to US$129 billion this year, according to iiMedia’s estimates. 
 “It is one of the tactics to stimulate online sales for most vendors, especially in the [Covid-19] recovery stage,” says Sophie Pan, research manager at IDC China. 
 Li is one of the most well-known faces of this booming trend, partially because he uses his face to test the lipsticks he sells. But Li has made a name for himself not just because of his eye-popping sales figures – which can reach millions of dollars in a single stream – but because his fans say he doesn’t act like a salesman. 
 “I haven’t bought any of the things he recommended but since I first saw his videos, I felt he was a very sincere person,” wrote one fan on China’s Q&amp;A forum Zhihu. 
 Influencers like Li build their fanbases by appearing to be genuine. Chatly’s Lauren Hallahan says they’re seen both as experts and as peers who help people cut through the overwhelming number of choices with their personal picks. 
 For many consumers, it’s also more comfortable to tune in to a livestream than to deal with pushy salespeople in stores. 
 “The consumer is more in control, they can leave at any point,” says Hallahan. 
 But not everyone is a fan. Liu Bo, a partner at venture capital firm Crystal Stream Capital, has told local media that the popularity of livestreaming ecommerce can be attributed to “lazy or sometimes mindless shoppers.” 
 Behind these purchases often lies a healthy dose of FOMO or “fear of missing out.” Viewers get bombarded with coupons, deals, and alerts of rapidly diminishing stock, all enticing them to buy now before it’s too late. 
 And it’s not just consumer goods on offer: In April, China’s “livestreaming sales queen” Viya apparently managed to sell a 40 million yuan (US$5.6 million) rocket launch service on a stream. 
 Viya and Li are among the many online influencers who are becoming household names, streaming either on Alibaba’s ecommerce platform Taobao or popular short-video platforms like Kuaishou or Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. 
 The pandemic has also changed perceptions of the role livestreaming sales can play in the economy. 
 After the lockdown ended in Wuhan, the pandemic’s ground zero, government officials used livestreaming to showcase their favorite local products. CEOs of major companies such as NetEase and Ctrip appeared on streams to sell smartphones, travel packages, and home appliances; IDC China’s Pan explains that using company CEOs adds more credibility to sales pitches. 
 The potential to boost business in the aftermath of the pandemic won livestreaming ecommerce newfound respect from the government. 
 The National Development and Reform Commission has launched a plan to encourage newer business models, including ecommerce, while President Xi Jinping has lauded livestreaming sales as a way to help rural residents shake off poverty. 
 According to employment website Lagou, demand for livestreaming hosts surged by almost 50% in the first half of this year. Municipal governments have also been trying to incorporate the trend in their development plans. 
 But it’s not clear how long the call of “Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!” will continue to be attractive. 
 A March survey from the China Consumer Association found that users liked to shop via livestreams because they’re more social and interactive, yet nearly 40% of them have run into problems – the biggest one being exaggerated and false marketing. 
 Even the beloved “King of Lipstick” lost some credibility after he had tried to advertise a non-stick pan that immediately became very sticky after Li’s attempt to fry an egg on it. 
 “I definitely think that the hype around livestreaming ecommerce will plateau at some point,” says Hallahan. She notes that although people will continue to buy from livestreamers, the hype around online trends in China tends to last for only one to two years. 
 After that, another type of content or platform will gain attention – and so the hype cycle begins again.

650223,How intrusive are contact-tracing apps in ASEAN?," With most experts saying that a vaccine for Covid-19 may not hit the market until mid-2021, ASEAN governments are seeking ways to ease lockdowns and create a close-to-normal society. Part of this effort is the release of contact-tracing apps. 
 These apps can access users’ locations and people they have been in contact with through GPS or Bluetooth technology. Once downloaded, such apps can access and exchange a user’s unique ID-related information via short-distance Bluetooth signals with any mobile phone with the same app. The person’s contact history will also be shared with relevant government agencies, which means that if any user has been exposed to an infected person, it will be documented. 
 Running in the background of your phone, it’s easy to forget how much of your information these apps can access. That’s why we surveyed these apps to discover just how intrusive they might be. 
 Straits Interactive assembled a local team from the International Association of Privacy Professionals to do a detailed privacy sweep of contact-tracing smart apps from the governments of six ASEAN countries. 
   ﻿  ﻿  ﻿  ﻿  ﻿   
 These contact-tracing apps were benchmarked against the survey parameters used by the Global Privacy Enforcement Network, which conducted a privacy sweep of mobile apps in 2014. That sweep involved the participation of 25 privacy enforcement authorities around the world. (View the full report  here .) 
 It assessed the following: 
 
 The types of permissions sought by a surveyed app 
 Whether those permissions exceeded what would be expected based on the app’s functionality 
 How the app explained to consumers why it wanted the personal data and what it planned to do with it 
 
 “Permissions” in an app protect the privacy of a user. Every app must include an “app manifest” that lists the permissions it uses, among other things. 
 A mobile phone’s operating system also dictates permissions to an extent. The vast majority of mobile phones run on the Android OS, and it uses two permission categories: 
 
 
 Normal permissions : These do not directly risk the user’s privacy. For example, granting permission to set the time zone is a normal one. If an app lists a normal permission in its manifest, the system grants it automatically. 
 
 Dangerous permissions : These give the app access to the user’s personal data in their mobile phones, such as contacts and SMS texts as well as certain system features like the camera. If a dangerous permission is requested, privacy laws do not allow the relevant personal data to be collected, used, or disclosed unless the user gives explicit consent by accepting the request for permission. In addition, privacy laws generally restrict dangerous permissions to personal data that the app may collect, use, or disclose while the user is actually using it. These laws also restrict the gathering of information simply because a user downloaded the app. 
 
 Often, people blindly agree to or allow these permissions without first understanding their functions and don’t read the privacy policies of the applications they use. 
 The following table shows the various dangerous permissions being used in the six contact-tracing smart apps we reviewed:

 What we found: Singapore’s TraceTogether and Vietnam’s Bluezone use the least permissions to perform its contact-tracing functions. Thailand’s MorChana uses the most. 
 We then looked at whether these dangerous permissions exceeded what would be expected based on the app’s functionality and also delved into their explanations in the privacy statement about why these permissions are needed and what will be done with the relevant personal data. 
 Before considering those points, here is an explanation of various permissions and some comments about potential risks if they were to be abused. 
   ﻿   
 The following tables summarize our findings (the sweeper is our reviewer).

 Singapore’s TraceTogether comes out on top in terms of privacy communications and overall marks. Its privacy statement and accompanying documents use simple English and explain clearly what the TraceTogether app does, what type of personal data is collected, and how it may be used or disclosed. Our review also shows that the permissions that the app seeks do not exceed its functionality and declared purposes. 
 While the TraceTogether app does not comply with all of the nine obligations under Singapore Personal Data Protection Act or all of the six processing principles under the  General Data Protection Regulation , it is generally consistent with those obligations and principles. The few areas where it falls short tend to reflect the nature of the app itself rather than an inadvertent or careless departure from an obligation or principle.

 Founded in 2012, Canva lets users easily create designs for social media posts, logos, and presentations, among others. It also offers a business-oriented product called Canva for Enterprise. 
 Canva will use the latest capital injection to double down on its education and enterprise products as it expands further in the US and other key markets, the company told  Tech in Asia . 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Since the start of the pandemic, Canva said it continues to see “a significant increase” in user activity, which has jumped by over 50%, as people continue to design and collaborate online. 
 For its print business, however, it had seen a  75% drop in revenue  before bouncing back, with its core revenues seeing 30% growth on average, according to a report by  CNBC . 
 According to Canva, its platform currently serves over 30 million people globally every month, with 80 designs per second or a total of over 3 billion designs created to date. 
 And since launching late last year, its workplace collaboration suite has attracted more than 500,000 businesses, over 90,000 schools and universities, and 55,000 nonprofits. Some of its paying clients include Warner Music, American Airlines, International Data Corporation, HubSpot, and Baxter International, among others. 
 Canva said it has been cash flow-positive since 2017, with a  US$1.2 million net profit  on US$25.1 million revenue. 
 “Being profitable has ensured we can weather uncertainty, including the current downturn being experienced across the globe,” the company noted. 
  What are its future plans?  With its fresh funding, Canva said it will be investing in its operations in the US, where it’s up against the likes of Adobe and Microsoft. 
 With a new office in Texas, its US team will provide strategic support for its enterprise clients, kicking off with Elevate 2020, its inaugural online enterprise conference, in July. 
 To further its international growth, the unicorn will also look at potential acquisitions and investments, particularly in the media and editing spaces, for the company’s engineering and product teams. 
 “Ultimately, we want Canva to be the go-to platform for all your design needs, so we’ll continue to monitor and evaluate acquisition opportunities,” Canva co-founder and chief operating officer Cliff Obrecht said. 
 In addition, the company will be rolling out new features such as a real-time collaboration tool that allows teams to work on designs simultaneously. It will also launch Canva Brainstorms so teams can work together on notes, mood boards, and ideas. 
 A new tool called Canva Talking Presentations will also allow presenters to talk through their slides in an interactive format. Canva for Desktop, meanwhile, will offer offline editing and other features by the end of the year. 
  What is its funding history?

650281,Gojek lays off 430 employees – 9% of total headcount," Indonesian super app Gojek has announced that it’s laying off 430 employees or about 9% of its total headcount. The layoffs are part of a “long-term response to the Covid-19 pandemic” to prioritize its core businesses of payments, transport, and food delivery, the company said in a statement. 
 Its GoLife division, which includes on-demand cleaning and massage services, will be closed down by July 27. The decacorn will also shutter GoFood Festivals, a physical food court concept featuring GoFood merchants.

 “Focusing on our core services, shutting down verticals that are no longer viable during this period, and making bold bets on changing customer needs will ensure that we continue making a positive impact on the lives of millions of people while securing future growth,” said Gojek co-CEOs Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi in an internal email sent to staff. 
 “Many” of the affected employees work for GoLife and GoFood Festivals, the company said, and this exercise will be the only Covid-19-related layoff. 
 Both Go-Life and GoFood Festivals saw a “significant downturn” due to the Covid-19 crisis. Its three core services aside, Gojek claims it’s seeing growth in logistics and groceries since the pandemic. 
 The changes were announced in a series of 16 internal town hall meetings attended by all employees. Retrenched staff will be provided with benefits such as enhanced severance payments, health insurance scheme extensions, and outplacement support. 
 A busy few months 
 Gojek has been in the headlines recently. It announced a fundraise from Silicon Valley titans  Facebook and Paypal  in early June, while its video-streaming service  GoPlay  closed its first independent funding round “in the ballpark of US$15 million.” 
 The news was then followed by  the departure  of its high-profile chief technology officer, Ajey Gore, after a five-year stint. Word about a Gojek layoff had floated earlier this year, but Soelistyo  denied  such news during the company’s March town hall. 
 Even as Covid-19 weakened the global economy, Gojek confirmed that it bought a minor stake in local taxi company Bluebird in February. The deal was reportedly worth  US$30 million . 
 In April, Gojek also announced its  acquisition  of Indonesian point-of-sales startup Moka in a deal expected to be worth over US$100 million. While this was publicly announced in the middle of the pandemic, these deals could have been sealed in the months prior. 
 Gojek is hardly the only tech giant to be affected by Covid-19. Just last week, its archrival Grab announced that it had  let go  of 360 people – around 5% of its total headcount – as it prepares for a “long recovery period” post-pandemic. 
 Similarly, Grab will be sunsetting some non-core projects and consolidating functions. It plans to adapt the core verticals of ride-hailing, payments, and financial services to the new normal, while also doubling down on delivery to meet increased demand. 
 2020 has proven to be a tough year for the tech community. So far, we have reported  layoffs  from prominent tech startups including  One Championship ,  Oyo ,  LendoEFL ,  Ola ,  Uber ,  Oriente ,  Zilingo ,  Hmlet , and  CXA . 
 Gojek’s letter addressing the layoffs 
 Below is the internal email sent to the company from co-CEOs Soelistyo and Aluwi: 
 
 Hello all, 
 After what was an emotionally tough day for everyone, we wanted to extend a heartfelt thanks to you all for listening, participating and understanding. The reason we held a townhall for each division within the company, instead of a company-wide one, was because we wanted to be present on a more personal level as we delivered the news, and to give you the chance to understand what this means for each of you on a departmental basis. 
 You heard from both of us how COVID-19 has affected our business and presented us with multiple challenges that we must all work to solve. The biggest challenge is the level of uncertainty ahead and the hard fact that this will forever change how some of our business and products need to operate. 
 We must respond to the external environment and increase our focus on building a stronger, more efficient business that will stand the test of time and stay relevant. Focusing on our core services, shutting down verticals that are no longer viable during this period, and making bold bets on changing customer needs will ensure that we continue making a positive impact on the lives of millions of people while securing future growth. But we’re sorry that the reality of implementing this has to be so painful. 
 The journey gets more difficult from here as we begin the process of separating from the 430 employees many of us have grown close to, while also closing down GoLife and GoFood Festivals – businesses that have played important and prominent roles in Gojek’s history. 
 With that in mind, we both wanted to share some individual thoughts. 
  From Kevin:  
  Five years ago, we had a moment when Gojek almost ran out of funds; payroll was due in a few days and without more money, we would not be able to pay everyone that month. I was calling people left, right and centre for emergency funding (in fact, at the time Andre sat on our board and he was one of the people I reached out to) on the stairs of our previous office, which overlooked the 150 or so people who were depending on us to find a solution.  
  At that moment, I had a deep appreciation of the fact that our employees had put their hopes, dreams and ambitions into this small startup, and if the company did not survive, we would be failing every single one of these people. Thankfully, we managed to secure funding and the rest is history.  
  One of my biggest fears as a leader is failing all of you, hence that was by far the hardest moment I had at Gojek, until today. Today, in each townhall, I felt like I’d failed so many of our colleagues. I’d like to personally apologize for what we unfortunately had to do. For those of you who we’ve had to let go, please know that this was something that both Andre and I fully recognize as our fault, not yours. We are sorry that this time we have failed you. We are truly grateful that you have contributed meaningfully to Gojek’s success over the years and are a valued part of our story; any company would benefit greatly to have you on their team and we will do everything possible to help you make the next step in your career. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you’d like to talk.  
  From Andre:  
  When we started out as Co-CEOs, I told everyone that I wanted to be a steady hand through whatever situation Gojek encountered. I hope that promise gives some reassurance that it was only after a huge amount of thought and soul searching that we came to this conclusion. This has been the most difficult decision that I have had to make at Gojek. I wish we had built a company that could carry all of us to the next chapter. But in the end, given all of the uncertainties in front of us, it has to be about the mission that we all undertook and making sure that this mission continues to grow and live on long after all of us are gone.  
  We had previously optimised the company for growth and impact and we imagined, naively, that the rate of growth would always accelerate. We didn’t plan enough for the inevitable downturn and we are paying for that now. But do I regret that? No I don’t, because at the very least, it meant that we got to work together with so many special individuals on a collective mission together. Even if only for a short time.  
  To those that are leaving, I know that this series of events may have left you with some sadness, anger and disappointment. If you will allow me to ask one thing of you, I ask that you never lose your love of Gojek. I hope that whenever you are on the road, and you see our Gojek driver partners proudly wearing the green jacket and helmet, you will always be reminded and feel proud, that you played a pivotal role in making all of this happen.  
 — 
 To those that are leaving us, you will meet with a representative from the People team and your manager in a meeting over the coming days. We wanted to help as much as possible, so have assembled the following package of benefits: 
 
 Severance payments: Financial continuity will be the biggest concern at this time. Employees will receive the statutory severance payment (we are setting a minimum of four weeks pay) plus an additional four weeks of salary for each year served. 
 Payment of notice period: We don’t expect employees to work their notice period as they will have enough on their minds as they look to the future. However, we will still pay this in full. 
 Equity arrangement: Annual cliffs on equity will be waived, to allow employees who are leaving us to have ownership stakes in the company that they have played a key part in building. 
 Payment of annual leave and other entitlements: We will pay unused annual leave, along with any other entitlements including parental leave. 
 Health insurance: Amid this global health crisis, we want to give our impacted employees the assurance that their healthcare needs will be provided for. We will extend the coverage for those on our health insurance scheme, as well as their dependents, until 31 December 2020. 
 Equipment: Employees can keep their laptops to help them as they search for their next opportunity. 
 Extension of Employee Assistance Program services: We are very mindful of the emotional and psychological well-being of everyone affected. That’s why we are extending our support services, encompassing mental health, financial and other advice for three months. 
 Outplacement service: Finding new employment is never easy, so we are adding an outplacement service that will help people with their job search. 
 
 We know that whatever we have to offer might not be enough to compensate for your disappointment, but we have done our best to put together a package that supports you in the most thoughtful way possible. We hope that you will look back at your time here fondly. We are part of your history, just as you are part of ours and that is a meaningful thing that we will always share. You have an extended family behind you wishing you success and helping at every given opportunity – please let us know if you need references, support or just a friendly ear. 
 To those staying, we’d like to reassure you that these will be our only COVID-19-related layoffs. Thank you for listening to us today and giving us the chance to explain our decisions. Let’s keep talking. When the dust has settled, we can look to the future, but for now, it is enough for us to just be here for each other.

650207,When journalists try to take down startups," Dear readers, 
 Sitting at a cafe, an executive at a tech company once lamented to me about how journalists seem eager to take down startups. I flashed a sorry smile: The media is indeed drawn to bad news like bees to a honeypot. 
 That got me thinking about the state of tech journalism. On one end of the spectrum, you have sites rewriting press releases. On the other end, you see outlets disregarding journalistic objectivity to report about the startup ecosystem with skepticism that’s usually fed by anonymously sourced information. 
 Media outlets have their own way of striking a balance between positive and negative coverage.  While  Tech in Asia  publishes complex, sensitive pieces, we also carry plenty of company announcements, though we’re figuring out ways to make them more insightful. 
 Whenever publications skew too far in one direction or the other, they create a risky situation. Many believe that there’s a certain nobility in journalism. We aren’t in it for the money, journalists tell themselves, we’re here to hold people accountable.

 But journalists can also act like assholes and justify their behavior with a refrain: “We’re just doing our jobs of upholding freedom of speech.” I’ve certainly made this mistake myself. 
 Often, reporters don’t provide companies ample opportunity for comment, or publish malicious insinuations without providing ample evidence. It can also be as innocuous as writing copy that’s snappy and eye-catching but isn’t fair or accurate. 
 Sadly, even subscription-based publications aren’t immune from sensationalism. It turns out that many readers enjoy seeing journalists dissect other people with a scalpel, while forgetting that they could one day be stabbed in the back by those same hacks. It’s like the gladiator games in Imperial Rome, but fought with sharp words and subtle deception instead of deadly weapons. 
 This sets a dangerous precedent: Feeding the bloodlust of trolls only creates echo chambers where arguments are not won with logic, but with savage takedowns. 
 “All these are eroding my love for journalism,” a colleague told me. “I think it’s overrated, and I prefer to read analyst reports. At least analysts put up their methodologies and always have numbers to back their work.” 
 Sadly, even as a journalist, I agree with this sentiment. The media – and we’re not just talking about tech publications – is seeing backlash over perceived biases and lazy reporting. 
 A core issue is the use of unnamed sources.  Tech in Asia  routinely uses anonymous sources for good reason – it’s the only way for ex-employees to avoid retribution for speaking up honestly. 
 I know how this method can be easily abused, so we do our best to scrutinize our sources, named or otherwise. But even then, articles can still become he-said-she-said debacles. 
 For readers, it all boils down to whether you trust the publication and its processes, which are generally opaque. And I can tell you that media outlets, including  Tech in Asia , struggle to get it exactly right. We’ve certainly made our fair share of mistakes. 
 A lot of work goes into verifying what sources say and deciding what ends up going into the story or on the cutting room floor. Publishing serious allegations – or even milder ones – could cost jobs and millions of dollars, so extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. 
  Tech in Asia  does its best to talk to the company’s CEO and key people to get their version of the story, too. And when we do that, we give them space to comment without any pre-judgment or hidden agenda. 
 In the long run, moderation and restraint wins. 
 We also try to communicate our approach as much as possible, which is what this letter is about. This is crucial when we’re chasing a sensitive story. In the past year alone, we’ve had our fair share of behind-the-scenes drama with companies, lawyers, government officials, and even our own investors, who bristled at our tough stories. 
 At one point, the CEO of a prominent unicorn called us “heartless.” But CEOs also consistently tell us that we’ve been fair to them, even when we asked them uncomfortable questions. We have readers who love us and critics who hate us. In this line of work, it’s impossible to please everyone – not that we should. 
 Instead, we’re always asking ourselves this: How do we publish content that best serves our ideals and the industry? Close to two years after launching our subscription business, I believe we are closer to an answer. 
 We believe that in the long run, moderation and restraint wins. We believe in building up the tech ecosystem rather than tearing it down for the sake of schadenfreude. 
 Yes, we’ll publish stories based on press releases, because they do serve a real need. But we’ll also continue pursuing hard-hitting stories injected with deep analysis. 
 We’ll keep on reflecting, refining, and experimenting – and we hope you’ll  subscribe  and join us on this journey. If you have any thoughts to share, I’d love to hear from you.

650169,Sequoia invests in Singapore quantum computing startup Horizon," All over the globe, there are tens of millions of conventional software developers, with 46 million registered on GitHub alone. However, fewer than 1,000 people globally are capable of developing new quantum applications, Singapore-based  Horizon Quantum Computing  observed. 
 The startup, which aims to make quantum computing accessible to every developer, has just raised an undisclosed amount of funding in a round led by Sequoia Capital India, bringing its total seed money to US$3.2 million. 
 Existing investors SGInnovate, Abies Ventures, Data Collective, Qubit Protocol, Summer Capital, and Posa CV also participated in the round. 
 
  Horizon CEO and founder Joe Fitzsimons / Photo credit: Horizon Quantum Computing 
 
 Founded in 2018, Horizon is developing tools so that programs designed for conventional computers can be automatically adapted for quantum processors. 
 It will use the new funds to speed up product development, bolster its team, and engage with customers and early adopters. 
  What problem is it solving?  “As hardware development continues to advance, learning to harness the power of quantum processors for business applications will become the main barrier to adoption,” Horizon CEO Joe Fitzsimons said. “We are tackling this problem head-on by developing methods to automatically accelerate conventional computer programs using quantum techniques.” 
 While the existing approach to quantum development relies on a domain expert to work on the problem or pre-written libraries that contain some common quantum algorithms, Horizon said its approach is different. It looks to enable developers to build programs with fewer lines of code and automatically optimize their programs for real processors. 
 “What makes our approach unique is that we construct quantum algorithms directly from conventional source code, automatically identifying places where it can be sped up,” Si-Hui Tan, chief science officer at Horizon, explained. 
  See also:  He has an ambitious plan to help ordinary coders write quantum computing software   
 Some deep-tech players in Singapore are also looking at making quantum computing more accessible. One example is  Entropica Labs , which is also backed by SGInnovate as well as Wavemaker Partners, among other investors. Another player is  SpeQtral , which is developing space-based quantum communication systems. 
 But Horizon said it doesn’t see quantum companies as direct competitors. Instead, it sees potential partners and even customers. 
 “We see our real competition as being in the conventional high-performance computing space rather than other companies focused on quantum software,” the company said. 
  What’s the opportunity?  A study from Boston Consulting Group reveals that the quantum applications market can reach over  US$260 billion  by 2050 as adoption picks up. 
 But instead of working to capture a large market share, the startup is focusing on “expanding” the market by making quantum computing a general-purpose computing tech. 
 According to Horizon, quantum computing can be applied to various industries, including logistics, finance, chemical, and pharmaceutics. In the future, it also looks to expand to newer domains such as computational fluid dynamics, electromagnetic simulations, and complex geophysical calculations. 
  What are its challenges?  For the company, the focus will be on strengthening its team as it continues to develop its tools. But the startup recognizes that attracting top talent experienced in quantum computing, compiler design, and other areas of computer science will be challenging, as they are in short supply at a time when industry demand is starting to increase. 
 Quantum computing hardware also has to be sufficiently reliable to outperform conventional computers in some tasks, Horizon said, marking another challenge for the firm. 
 In October, Google seemed to have pushed the technology forward by claiming  quantum supremacy . However, Horizon said there’s still more work to be done for the tech to reach its full potential. 
 “The ability to expand this market into areas currently dominated by conventional computing solutions will be the largest determining factor of success,” it said. 
  How much traction does it aim to get?  While it has yet to launch its toolset, Horizon has begun working with some early adopters. 
  “As a business-to-business company, our focus is on the value that we create for our customers in the public and private sectors, rather than the number of users,” the company said, adding that it looks to work with key players in finance, aerospace, and energy sectors in the near term.  
  Who are the team members?  Fitzsimons holds a doctorate in quantum computing architectures from the University of Oxford and has over 15 years of experience in quantum computing and computational complexity. 
 Tan, meanwhile, also holds a doctorate in physics from MIT and has been involved in quantum research for 15 years. 
  What is the startup’s funding history?  In November 2018, Horizon secured an undisclosed amount of seed funding from SGInnovate, Abies Ventures, Data Collective, Qubit Protocol, Summer Capital, and Posa CV.

650171,Tencent’s “dog-eat-dog” gaming empire," When Tencent’s blockbuster multiplayer online battle arena game  Honor of Kings  (internationally known as Arena of Valor) rolled out in 2015, it had a fierce competitor –  We MOBA . 
 Here’s what’s peculiar: Both games were created by Tencent.  Honor of Kings  was developed by TiMi Studios and  We MOBA  was housed under Lightspeed &amp; Quantum Studios, which are both in-house developer groups in the company.

 The market immediately crowned  Honor of Kings  the better game of the two. Consequently, Tencent allocated its promotion, marketing, and distribution resources toward the title, which went on to dominate global download charts and emerged sixth in the rankings for consumer spending, according to estimates by app analytics firm App Annie. 
  We MOBA , on the other hand, saw sluggish sales and was eventually discontinued in 2019. 
 Tencent Games’ empire relies heavily on this approach, pitting internal studios against each other and letting consumers decide on the victor. While this is a recipe for constant improvement and innovation, the approach could lead to an overemphasis on profit-making and may eventually suffocate innovation. 
 Betting on the “horse race” 
 The “horse race” approach, as Tencent calls it, underlies the success of many of its flagship products. In fact, the company’s messaging app WeChat is the product of internal rivalry, as founder and CEO Pony Ma once  said . 
 Back in 2010, QQ, a popular messaging platform developed by Tencent, was tasked to resolve a slew of mobile messaging issues. Three teams were given the assignment – QQ, QQ Mobile, and QQ Mail. The version created by QQ’s mail service eventually came out on top and became WeChat as we know it. 
 In the wider game development industry in China, this Darwinian approach is commonly referred to as the “yang gu” model, which is a term with a rather sinister meaning. It stems from a traditional method of making poison by sealing venomous creatures (such as centipedes, snakes, or scorpions) inside a closed container, where they devour each other. 
 Within Tencent, in most cases, the team that makes the more popular version of a game not only gets to bask in the halo of prestige but also gains access to the coveted game promotion and distribution channel WeChat.

 “The rivalry between game studios is fierce. Whoever lags behind, gets eliminated,” a Tencent Games developer tells  Tech in Asia . 
 The ongoing battle between TiMi and Lightspeed &amp; Quantum, two of Tencent’s most well-known studios, is no secret in the game development scene either. After TiMi triumphed with  Honor of Kings , the battle between the groups flared up again in 2018 when Tencent struck a deal with Bluehole Studio for the exclusive distribution rights to hit battle royale game  PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds  (PUBG) in China. The studios were assigned the task to build the mobile version of the game. 
 This time around, players favored the trial version developed by Lightspeed &amp; Quantum,  PUBG: Exhilarating Battlefield . 
 This came as a surprise since TiMi had been known as the most prominent studio with blockbuster games, including  Honor of Kings ,  QQ Speed , and  Call of Duty: Mobile , in its portfolio. 
 While TiMi reworked its version and released the game under the title  PUBG: Army Attack , the reception was miserly in comparison to Exhilarating Battlefield’s. According to third-party platform Quest Mobile, the daily active users (DAU) of the version developed by Lightspeed &amp; Quantum and TiMi was  43.09 million and 5.84 million , respectively, as of September 2018. 
 After winning the popularity contest, the former was launched worldwide as  PUBG Mobile , which became one of the world’s highest-grossing mobile games with a consumer spend of US$825 million in the past year and 260 million in lifetime downloads worldwide, according to App Annie’s estimates. 
   ﻿  ﻿  ﻿  ﻿  ﻿   
     
 Like WeChat, Tencent’s four in-house game studios, including TiMi and Lightspeed &amp; Quantum, have been forged from rivalry. 
 In a bid to consolidate its internal game studios in 2014, Tencent merged 20-some smaller groups into its four existing entities: TiMi Studios, Lightspeed &amp; Quantum Studios, Morefun Studio Group, and Aurora Studios. Meanwhile, some of the less competitive teams were dropped by Tencent. “We encourage healthy competition between internal game studios,” Tencent said in a  comment  regarding the structural change in its game unit, adding that by giving studios more autonomy, games could be developed faster and better. 
 Apart from the four main teams, Tencent has another rather secretive studio called Tencent Boston, set up in 2008 to focus on the North American market. The group has yet to release any games. 
 Charlie Moseley, a Chengdu-based game developer and co-founder of mobile game company Tap4Fun, tells  Tech in Asia  that facilitating this kind of internal rivalry is a Chinese approach. The country’s game development scene, and the entire industry for that matter, is more of a dog-eat-dog jungle, says Moseley. 
 “This type of competition is not so common outside of China,” he says. However, other developers and publishers around the world have begun experimenting with the practices common in the country, Moseley adds. 
 Case in point, King, the developer of Candy Crush, uses a similar tactic. Most of the company’s existing games were introduced as  beta versions  on Facebook first, and it then used metrics such as player count and feedback to determine which of these titles it would develop further. 
 Tencent declined to comment on the internal rivalry between its game studios. 
 A fight for survival 
 A large distribution channel and a breadth of promotion tools are Tencent’s natural advantages over other gaming giants like NetEase. 
 However, even for Tencent, resources are limited and must be used strategically. 
 The company’s most coveted traffic funnels include WeChat, QQ, and the Tencent App Store. As a super app with more than 1.15 billion monthly active users, WeChat is a far more powerful marketing vehicle and portal for games than QQ, which only has around 731 million monthly active users. 
 As a result, the games that perform better in trial runs are marketed on WeChat and get a landslide of distribution resources when they officially launch.

 There’s actually a logic to how Tencent pits studios against one another, says Daniel Ahmad, a senior analyst at Niko Partners. “Tencent can pair the right studio with the right license. We see this less as a rivalry between studios [and more] as building options and a strong, broad product pipeline,” he adds. 
 This approach allows the company to hedge bets on various titles within the same genre, says Ahmad. Through an aggressive M&amp;A strategy and fast international expansion over the years, Tencent has gained exclusive rights and built its dominance in China for certain genres like battle royale. 
 It’s also a way to keep game developers on their toes. Before beating TiMi in creating the mobile version of  PUBG , Lightspeed &amp; Quantum had not rolled out a single blockbuster title. To win against TiMi, the group assembled a team of more than 200 people, mainly made up of hardcore players with at least 1,000 hours of play time under their belts, according to the head of the studio. 
 Emerging victorious in Tencent’s internal rivalry is almost a guarantee for success in the business, says Gabriel Liu, game and esports analyst of video game developer FunPlus. Not only do these studios get a chance to compete with a few “top dogs in Tencent,” they also receive financial rewards and get access to resources for promotion and distribution, he says. On the flipside, it’s a fight for survival for game development companies outside of Tencent. 
 With the horse race approach, Tencent also has room to explore various directions among product teams and can have a certain period of trial and error in areas without a clear direction, said Tony Zhang Zhidong, co-founder of Tencent. Indeed,  Honor of Kings  and  PUBG  were examples of how Tencent used this approach to dominate certain genres. 
 Stunting innovation 
 There are critics to this approach, however. 
 The strategy of terminating any game title that is not as profitable is “barbaric,” a person who worked for a Tencent partner firm previously told  Chinese media . Focusing too much on sales figures and winning the race, the person said, can ultimately discourage game creators and developers from incorporating new ideas. 
 With revenue as a prime indicator for Tencent, game quality and user experience may also drop. 
 On its part, Tencent recognized that the deeply embedded competitive culture could indeed create a cutthroat and siloed environment. In 2018, the Chinese firm said it would dial down in-house competition especially in emerging areas like data and AI research. In his comment regarding the announcement, Zhang  said  that internal rivalry often leads to “overly fragmented teams and overlapping directions which result in waste and internal friction in hot areas, and neglect in important fields as well.” 
 For companies who work with Tencent, betting on the wrong horse can also result in huge losses, as Monster Energy learned when it entered into an endorsement deal with TiMi reportedly worth tens of millions of yuan. 
 Despite its dominance in the gaming industry, Tencent has yet to cultivate sophisticated intellectual property expertise internally – powerhouse game titles including  PUBG Mobile  and  Call of Duty: Mobile  are licensed from other game developers after all. 
 Perhaps to boost its ability to create original games, the company  decided to hire  Japanese veteran game designer Kenichiro Imaizumi and Halo 4 lead designer Scott Warner in May. 
 Whether or not cultivating internal rivalries is a boon to Tencent’s new ambition is still unclear. But it seems the company will continue to use the strategy nonetheless. In emerging areas like game livestreaming, for example, Tencent is reportedly pitting Duoyu and Huya against each other, two game livestreaming platforms that it has stakes in. 
 The two platforms have grown increasingly similar, and it was speculated that Tencent would eventually merge the two entities, mirroring the strategy it employs in its dog-eat-dog gaming empire. 
  App Annie’s data excludes PUBG Mobile on Android in China, as well as both iOS and Android versions of Game for Peace, the version of the game that adhere’s to China’s regulations on gaming content.

649996,Jendela360 bags $1m to make virtual tours the ‘new normal’ of property buying,"  Jendela360 , an Indonesian proptech startup, said it has raised US$1 million in a funding round led by Beenext. Prasetia Dwidharma, Everhaus, and some strategic investors from the property consulting space also participated in the round. 
 The latest investment comes after Jendela360 secured seed money from Everhaus in 2018.

 Founded in 2016, Jendela360 operates a marketplace that connects clients, landlords, and agents. It features various digital solutions such as 360-degree virtual tours, digital signature support, integrated electronic payment methods, and an AI price prediction system. 
 The startup will use the new funds to enhance the platform’s online-to-offline approach by recruiting agents and developing a more thorough training system for them, Jendela360 co-founder and chief operating officer Kiki Guzali said. 
  What problem is it solving?  According to the startup, property seekers usually spend too much time talking with three or more different agents. They also deal with scattered and incomplete information and poor-quality images when searching for available properties. Agents, meanwhile, need standardization on the service level and better brokerage support. 
 These are the pain points that Jendela360 is trying to solve. It also wants to make 360-degree virtual tours the “new normal” for Indonesia’s property market. 
 “We are the first to introduce 360-degree virtual tours for property viewing, and we are an O2O proptech company that basically does end-to-end approach,” Daniel Rannu, CEO and co-founder of Jendela360, told  Tech in Asia . 
 Through the platform, users can browse listings, contact an agent, view properties, negotiate prices, sign a contract, and make payments, he added. 
 The company, however, isn’t the only startup looking to digitize the property space. One local player is Travelio, which raised  US$18 million  in series B money from Gobi Partners, Samsung, and Temasek’s Pavilion Capital late last year. There’s also the Kakao Ventures-backed Mamikos and Infokost. 
 Meanwhile, across the region, Singapore-based PropertyGuru claims it takes up over 75% market share in the city-state. It also operates in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. It’s working to shift from a property marketplace to a “trust platform,” venturing into  home financing  just recently. 
  What are its challenges?  As a platform business, Jendela360 continues to work towards balancing the number of listings with customer demand. This was particularly crucial for the company during its early days when an end-to-end standardized service was still new to Indonesians, Rannu shared. 
 However, the company said it has become easier to educate people about innovation. The Covid-19 pandemic has also forced many to turn to digital solutions. 
  What’s the opportunity?  In Indonesia, the real estate market was worth US$30 billion last year, according to the company. To acquire a significant market share, Jendela360 aims to become a full-stack property platform that supports the buying and renting of residential as well as commercial properties. 
 The company is also optimistic about the adoption of 360-degree virtual tours for viewing properties, as many people are still reluctant to go out amid the pandemic. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Jendela360 said it has seen a 30x growth in its transaction value in the past three years. It currently has over 10,000 paying customers and claims to be the largest apartment site in Indonesia, with 100,000 monthly web traffic. 
  Who are the team members?  Rannu and Guzali run Jendela360 together with Ade Indra, the startup’s chief financial officer and co-founder who has a background in business and hospitality. Rannu has 10 years of experience in tech development and digital marketing, while Guzali was previously an advisor in a real estate firm.

650128,Bukalapak co-founder Fajrin Rasyid steps down to join state telco,"  Bukalapak  co-founder and president director Fajrin Rasyid has been appointed digital director at the state’s largest telecom operator, Telkom Indonesia. He replaces Faisal Rochmad Djoemadi. A statement from the ecommerce provider confirmed that Rasyid has left the company. 
 “I am very grateful for the new mandate given to me,” Rasyid said. “In these 10 years together with Bukalapak, we have inspired young Indonesians to continue to dream and work hard. Now is the time for me to help Indonesia advance further, with a focus on developing Indonesian telecommunications, together with Telkom.”

 Bukalapak CEO Rachmat Kaimuddin said he hopes that the concept of digitizing micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), created by Fajrin and the other co-founders, will continue to be fundamental for the development of MSMEs in Indonesia. 
 “I am sure Fajrin is the right person to occupy this position and he can continue his aspirations to contribute to Indonesia on a much larger scale,” Kaimuddin said. 
 At the age of 34, Rasyid has become the youngest director at Telkom. He will hand over his functional duties and responsibilities as president of Bukalapak to the startup’s board of directors. 
 Together with Ahmad Zaky and Nugroho Herucahyono, Rasyid co-founded Bukalapak in 2011 and developed it into a unicorn and one of the biggest online marketplaces in Indonesia. In 2019, Bukalapak was valued at over US$2.5 billion, backed by global investors that include Indonesia’s EMTEK group, Singapore’s GIC, Ant Financial, Naver, and VC firm 500 Startups. 
 Rasyid acted as the chief financial officer prior to being appointed as president of Bukalapak. Before that, he worked at the Boston Consulting Group and was co-founder and CEO of digital agency Suitmedia from 2011 until 2014.

650075,Taiwanese AI healthtech startup bags $2.7m in Asus-led round," Taiwan’s  Deep01 , a startup that provides AI-based healthcare solutions such as medical imaging, said it has raised US$2.7 million in a round led by global electronics manufacturer AsusTeK. 
 The round also saw participation from BE Capital and Digital Economy Fund, co-funded by the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Institute for Information Industry, according to a statement. 
 
  Corporate vice president and co-head of Asus’ AIoT business group Albert Chang (left) and Deep01 CEO and co-founder David Chou / Photo credit: Deep01 
 
 Established in 2016, Deep01 develops an AI software that helps physicians accurately interpret computerized tomography (CT) images of the brain. It claims its product can detect acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) – a type of stroke – for accident and emergency (A&amp;E) departments with an accuracy of 93% to 95% at 30 seconds per case. 
 Deep01 claims to be the first AI company in Asia Pacific to obtain US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearances in July 2019. Its technology also won approval from Taiwan’s FDA in February this year. 
  What problem is it solving?  Stroke and brain trauma, which are commonly seen in A&amp;E departments, are the main causes of acute brain hemorrhages, a spokesperson for the startup told  Tech in Asia . After a patient takes a CT scan, a doctor would have to check and see if a radiologist or neurosurgeon is needed for consultation. 
 Deep01’s solution helps save time by quickly analyzing CT images and highlighting ICH or related cases so patients get treatment in time. 
  What’s the opportunity?  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 795,000 people have a stroke each year, costing an estimated US$34 billion in medical expenses and missed days of work annually. 
 “All stroke patients require a brain CT scan to detect brain bleeding, and that is where Deep01 can help,” the Deep01 spokesperson said. 
 Moving forward, the company aims to expand into global markets and offer more AI-based services to A&amp;E, radiology, and neurosurgery departments. 
 “The ICT and healthcare industries in Taiwan are competitive on the international stage, and successful cases of commercialization will make our product more feasible in the global market,” said Deep01 founder and CEO David Chou. 
  What are its challenges?  The company said its biggest struggle is working to bridge the medical industry with innovations in the healthtech sector. 
 “The medical industry is relatively conservative, while AI is innovative. You will need to work with professionals from both areas and combine them,” the spokesperson said. 
 Being based in Taiwan is an advantage for Deep01, given the country’s performance in both technology and medical treatment. 
  How much traction is it targeting?  With its licenses, Deep01’s tech is currently deployed in two medical centers and four local hospitals in Taiwan, where it has helped physicians check over 2,000 acute cases of brain CT images. 
 According to BE Capital managing director Arthur Chen, Deep01’s system has been showing profitable results. “The AI emergency network has potential in the overseas markets. We introduced the company to the authorities in Japan, and the integration will proceed in the second half of this year,” he said. 
 The company said that this year, it aims to have 30 hospitals using its AI detection system to analyze a total of over 200,000 CT scans. 
  Who are the team members?  Prior to Deep01, Chou worked as a software architect for Theia, a software and hardware integration technology developer for 3D computer vision. He founded the startup alongside Jesse Wang, a neurosurgeon in National Taiwan University Hospital with over 13 years of experience. 
 Currently, the 15-strong Deep01 AI team consists of data scientists and engineers from Harvard University, Carnegie Mellon University, National Taiwan University, and Tsinghua University.

649890,Gojek and chill,"   
 It’s Friday night. You just want to get home and chill after a week of working hard. So you pull out your phone and book yourself a Gojek ride. 
 While on the road, you shortlist some content on GoPlay that you plan to watch. As you arrive at your place, you log onto GoFood to order dinner. 
 “Ah, ada diskon! Maybe Indomie goreng sambal roa from Upnormal Cafe,” you tell yourself. 
 Done with your order, you take a shower. After that, you load up your GoPlay as you dry your hair, selecting a program from the list you made earlier. 
 The bell rings, so you go to the door. You say “Terima kasih,” to the delivery person as you collect your food. 
 You dig into your noodles and spend the evening indulging in a local romantic comedy. Midway through your second show, you scratch your belly and settle in with a choco chizu from Fore Coffee to complete your night. 
 Going hyperlocal 
 Launching GoPlay,  a streaming service  aimed at its home market, is a signal that Indonesian decacorn Gojek is going hyperlocal, not regional. 
 It’s not a bad move. Gojek aims to be the super app that truly understands Indonesian users, and it’s still in a good position to do so. But to achieve that, it has to refocus its resources and position to have a better shot at pulling away from the competition. That means, Gojek has to become even more Indonesian and maybe drop its regional ambition. 
 In theory, producing local content  and games  can attract more consumers into the Gojek ecosystem, therefore creating a stickier user habit and brand loyalty. It also helps the company understand its users much better as customers use its suite of services in Bahasa Indonesian. It may drive down average user acquisition costs as well. 
 After all, Indonesia is the market that matters most in Southeast Asia. The archipelago may not be a top-paying market today, but it has  enormous potential given its size and growth . 
 If Gojek loses its grip on Indonesia, it loses everything. So going hyperlocal is the next logical step as it plays to win. 
 Grab’s food delivery and ride-hailing services are popular in Indonesia, running  neck and neck with Gojek . And even though Grab was named the  fifth unicorn  in the country, I don’t foresee it going down the same hyper-localization path for Indonesia. 
 Building high-quality content is hard and will open up a can of worms. Not only do you have to fight against local content companies, but you also have to fend off giants like Netflix, which will soon be  unblocked  in Indonesia. 
   
 Gojek and Grab painted a similar vision at the start, but they’re starting to move in different directions. It’s good business and a healthy development for both companies. There’s also a big enough market for both local and regional super apps  to co-exist  as we still have some way to go in digitizing the economy.

650007,Thai fintech firm Synqa rakes in $80m in series C funding," Thailand-based fintech firm  Synqa , formerly known as Omise Holdings, announced it has raised US$80 million in series C funding led by SCB 10X and Sparx Group through its Mirai Creation Fund II. 
 Toyota Financial Services, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, SMBC Venture Capital, Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance, and other investors joined the round, according to a statement. 
 
  Synqa CEO and founder Jun Hasegawa / Photo credit: Synqa 
 
 Founded in 2015, the startup acts as the parent company of payment gateway Omise, which offers a suite of payment features such as an acceptance interface, e-wallet, and cross-border remittances. It also operates blockchain-powered money transfers and payments tool OMG Network, previously known as OmiseGo. 
 Synqa plans to use the new funds to add more capabilities to its tech stack to make Omise more attractive to merchants, a spokesperson for the company told  Tech in Asia . 
  What is the company’s funding history?  Prior to its series C round, Synqa had secured a total of US$20 million over several funding rounds. It had also raised US$25 million via a digital token sale back in 2017. Here’s a summary: 
 
 
 Seed  (2014): US$300,000 from East Ventures 
 
 Series A  (2015): US$2.6 million from SMDV (lead), East Ventures, 500 TukTuks, and Thai telco True Group 
 
 Series B  (2016): US$17.5 million from SBI Investment (lead), SMDV, Ascend Money, and Golden Gate Ventures 
 
 Series B  (2018): Undisclosed amount from Global Brain (lead), 31Ventures, and SMDV 
 
 Series B  (2019): Undisclosed amount from Nomura Holdings 
 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Synqa currently has thousands of merchants in Southeast Asia and Japan, the spokesperson said without disclosing specific figures. 
 Since its latest funding round, Synqa has partnered with companies such as PayNow in Singapore as well as TrueMoney Wallet and Citibank in Thailand to offer more payment solutions to its customers. 
 Part of its series C funds will also be used to propel a new subsidiary to further expand its reach, said the startup, adding that the new entity, which has yet to be announced, was formed to meet enterprise market demand for fintech transformation. Its team will be working closely with enterprises to develop end-to-end fintech products like the Toyota Wallet app, one of its supported products. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  Synqa considers the ongoing pandemic as one of its biggest challenges. 
 “Covid-19 has affected everyone, and fintech businesses are no exception. We had to adapt our ways of working, we modeled the worst-case scenario for all entities, and we changed our strategies,” the spokesperson said. 
 Part of its response to the crisis was to help food and beverage businesses in Singapore shift to cashless payments through PayNow. 
  What are its future plans?  “Despite being a big challenge for us, we see a lot of opportunities in shifting to a cashless society in a world post-Covid-19,” the spokesperson said. 
 With this shift, Synqa aims to continue deepening its expertise in online payments, financial infrastructure, blockchain, and digital transformation.

649947,Logistics startup Shipper bags series A money to double down on Indonesia,"  Shipper , an Indonesia-based logistics platform, has secured an undisclosed amount of series A funding in a round led by consumer internet group and tech investor Prosus Ventures (formerly Naspers Ventures) to further scale in the archipelago. 
 Existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, Floodgate, Y Combinator, Insignia Ventures Partners, and AC Ventures also participated in the round. 
 
  Shipper team / Photo credit: Shipper 
 
 Launched in 2016, Shipper offers a one-stop logistics solution that offers a multi-courier shipping platform and distributed warehousing and fulfillment network. It aims to help solve three major problems in the industry: a confusing plethora of different warehousing and shipping options, a lack of pricing transparency, and below-average tracking systems. 
 Shipper will use the new funds to ramp up hiring to build out its data and tech capabilities, Budi Handoko, chief operating officer and co-founder at Shipper, said. The investment will also help the startup to continue expanding its solutions. 
  What is the startup’s funding history?  Shipper closed its  seed round  in 2019, raising US$5 million from Y Combinator, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Floodgate, Insignia Ventures Partners, and Convergence Ventures. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Over the past year, Shipper saw about 10x to 15x in growth, Handoko told  Tech in Asia . He also noted that logistics services in the country is in high demand and that technology is needed to make the fragmented network more structured. 
  See also:  Indonesia’s logistics scene is growing fast. Here are the main players   
 The startup currently works with more than 100 express couriers and has over 30 fulfillment centers, with plans to expand its reach to new regions in its home market. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  Customers will continue to come and go as the Covid-19 pandemic hits businesses. 
 To address this, the startup will focus on further developing its technology to empower its logistics partners and meet customer demand. 
  What are its future plans?  During the announcement of its seed round last year, Shipper revealed plans to expand into Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines soon. But with a pandemic-hit economy, the startup said it’s choosing to focus on Indonesia for now. 
 “As of today, all of our team is very focused on creating value for Indonesia and we’re not at the moment looking at external markets. But it is still a mission and vision of ours to create impact broadly across the region,” Handoko said. 
 Although the logistics market in Indonesia is projected to hit US$240 billion by 2021, the processes are still very inefficient. In tier-two and tier-three cities, shipping costs are still expensive – adding up to 40% more on top of a customer’s total purchase amount – becoming a major barrier to mass ecommerce adoption.

650015,Exclusive: One Championship CEO explains what’s next after steep layoffs," One Championship has been weathering a barrage of hits from doubters lately after announcing on June 15 that it’s  laying off 20% of its headcount . 
 But the sports media company appears to be in a comfortable cash position for now. In the same announcement, it also said that it had just completed a US$70 million fundraise. Existing backers Sequoia Capital and Temasek Holdings participated in the round, which also included a new investor described as a “blue-chip multibillion-dollar investment firm in the US with heavy sports media and tech expertise.” 
 Of course, One isn’t throwing in the towel and dropping its bid to become “Asia’s first global sports media property,” as company chairman and chief executive Chatri Sityodtong puts it. 
 “We’re grateful that we now have a multiyear runway under any scenario,” he tells  Tech in Asia  in an exclusive interview.

 Assuming One continued its revenue growth trajectory in 2019, the company could be looking at a runway of close to four years,  Tech in Asia’s  research shows. 
    
 Covid-19, however, could throw a spanner in the works. One’s revenues from February to May 2020 were hit by social distancing and other measures to contain the pandemic, which forced the company to put all its events – its bread and butter – on ice. It held its last event behind closed doors in Singapore on February 28. 
 Losses are but a drop in a bucket. 
 Lately, One has come under the scrutiny of  many   media outlets  because of its financial figures. 
 It posted three consecutive annual eight-figure losses from 2016 to 2018 that amounted to more than S$175 million (US$126 million), according to company filings seen by  Tech in Asia . The bulk of it stemmed from “marketing expenses, administration, and other expenses.”

 Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of One’s revenue in 2017 consisted of barter deals instead of cash transactions. Since its 2018 financial statement doesn’t single out barter transactions, it’s unclear how much of its sponsorship income that year consisted of cash and noncash deals. 
 The company declined to comment on how much barter transactions factored into its 2018 earnings but said it expects such revenues to “be flat over time.” Describing the nature of such deals, Sityodtong cites how One Championship received free business travel for its team in exchange for an advertisement spot at one of its events. 
 “Barter transactions are a way for One Championship to get essential services for events without paying cash,” he says. 
 Sityodtong shrugged off the deficits, saying they are “a drop in a bucket” as the company is building a “US$100 billion property.” 
 Every company needs to hemorrhage millions to build its empire. 
 “Like Facebook, YouTube and Amazon, every company needs to hemorrhage millions to build its empire – into its product, platform, brand, ecosystem and infrastructure, before it becomes legendary,” he observes. “We’re more than prepared to invest up to US$1 billion, if that’s what it takes.” 
 The CEO also criticizes media reports that “pick on” its losses, adding that the method of using financials to gauge a startup’s success is “seriously flawed.” 
 Indeed, internet startups normally rack up huge losses in their early days to build market share, although that is contingent on being able to raise more money from investors. But capital is harder to come by during a recession, which means that market sentiments now favor startups that prioritize profitability. 
 At present, One is focusing on increasing its viewership, with an eye on monetizing it down the line. “For a sports media property like ours, reach, frequency, and engagement are the most important health metrics,” Sityodtong notes, and the company’s digital social numbers can attest to that. “Even if One lost US$1 billion, I’d still be very happy, as long as our metrics kept on growing exponentially,” he stresses. 
 To prove his point, Sityodtong cites the 4 billion organic views that the firm racked up in 2019, which had grown “exponentially” from 140,000 in 2014. One is even on track to exceed that despite the sucker punch thrown by Covid-19. “There are no other media properties with those numbers,” he adds. 
    
 In 2019, One overtook US-based Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to become the most-watched mixed martial arts (MMA) organization online. The Asian startup offers its content for free via its Facebook, YouTube and Instagram accounts as well as through its One Super App. 
 Squaring off with the UFC 
 However, while it has surpassed the UFC in online viewership numbers, One is still catching up in many other areas, such as revenue. UFC’s revenue reached  US$666 million  in 2016. In 2019, the MMA company struck a deal with sports broadcaster ESPN that was  worth US$1.5 billion . 
 In comparison, One recorded S$37.2 million (US$26.7 million) in revenues for 2018. That same year, the company also secured a landmark “eight-figure sum” for the rights to air its events from US broadcaster Turner Sports. 
    
  Comparing their numbers, UFC seems less reliant on sponsors, while One appears to depend heavily on sponsorship income, which accounts for nearly half of its total revenue.  
 Another key difference is that UFC makes a  ton of money from pay-per-view (PPV) sales  as it’s part of a mature US market that’s willing to pay for combat sports content. UFC reaped an estimated US$180 million in PPV sales from a 2018 match between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor. 
 Since PPVs work so well for its competitor, shouldn’t One do it too? Sityodtong tells  Tech in Asia  that the company was aiming to launch such a model in the second half of 2020, but the pandemic pushed back its plan. 
 “We’re trying to get our PPV model up and running by this year’s fourth quarter, but it’s uncertain, given the current volatile Covid-19 situation,” says Sityodtong. 
 Getting viewers to pay for One’s content would be the perfect litmus test for market validation. If people are willing to pay for your content, it’s a sign that they value it. Consumers in many parts of Asia, however, still aren’t used to doing that. 
 Cultural impact is a metric that’s more difficult to measure. Established in 1993, UFC has produced bankable superstar athletes like McGregor and Ronda Rousey, who have attained fame beyond hardcore MMA fans. That often translates to ticket sales and other revenue streams. 
    
  One Championship, meanwhile, has been criticized for using “various tactics to try and mask the low turnout of its events, including giving away tickets for free” to fill arenas, according to  The Ken .  
 One isn’t “a music concert organizer that only relies on selling tickets” to generate most of its revenue, Sityodtong says in response to these claims. “Sometimes, we don’t manage to sell out venues, but our biggest source of revenue is our broadcast rights. These media outlets… they don’t get that.” 
 
  One Championship has caught up with UFC in terms of online viewership but still trails behind in several aspects. / Photo credit: UFC 
 
 Another consideration is that UFC took a long time to become a titan in this field. In contrast, One is a relatively young company that began in 2011 – 18 years after UFC was set up. 
 However, One should be showing accelerated revenue growth, given that it has a few things going for it: the explosion of social media, the elevated status of MMA (thanks to UFC’s pioneering work), and venture capital money. 
 “UFC controls an 80% market share of the western hemisphere, but One Championship controls 90% of the market share in the Eastern hemisphere. And we’re the two big 800-pound gorillas in the industry,” Sityodtong told  Business Insider . 
 Sudden job cuts 
 Before it can get there, however, One is facing some hurdles like the Covid-19 crisis. The June 15 layoffs came out of left field, according to One employees who spoke to  Tech in Asia . 
 “We were insanely busy and then the end came without warning,” says one ex-staff who requested anonymity. “The only message we got the week before was, ‘We’re not immune from the crisis.’”

 “The leadership’s outlook seemed optimistic,” says another former employee, remarking that One seemed initially unfazed by Covid-19, even as reports of layoffs and struggling companies were rife. 
 The layoff figure may also be higher than the announced 20%, several sources tell  Tech in Asia . 
 Sityodtong, however, explains that these employees may have a different perspective since entire departments in some countries were retrenched “all at once.” 
 “There are offices that were hit harder than the rest,” he says. While the decision to slash jobs was “heart-wrenching,” the CEO stuck to the official number. 
 “This is why we were generous with the  retrenchment packages . We wanted to do right by those [who are] leaving us,” he says. 
 Returning to the ring 
 After fight cards got sidelined for over three months due to Covid-19, Sityodtong says the company’s immediate priority is to “get back up and running.” This weekend, One Championship is broadcasting its first public event in China since lockdown measures were imposed in January. Called “One Hero,” the competition will feature 12 fighters who want to be “Asia’s next martial arts superstar.” 
 One expects to fill stadiums again by this summer, relaunching its flagship events later this quarter. But Sityodtong remains on high alert because of the “very tricky” global environment. 
 “It’s still unclear when fights can resume because of the travel restrictions, quarantine and distancing rules,” he points out. 
 Apart from events, the company is going to work on its “content stack,” which includes two reality shows: travel-focused  Warrior  and  The Apprentice: One Championship Edition , which will feature contestants facing off to clinch a “once-in-a-lifetime” US$250,000 job working under Sityodtong himself.

 Though Covid-19 has cast a shadow on the company, it also gave other segments of One’s business a chance to shine. Its video platforms have seen “record-breaking growth” in organic traffic while online sales of its merchandise have also skyrocketed. “We’ll continue to push for success in those areas,” says Sityodtong. 
 Looking ahead, One’s head honcho has ambitions to televise in every country in the world within the next two years. The company currently airs its fights in “over 150 countries.” 
 “We’re constantly renewing agreements with current broadcasters and increasing our footprint. This is a huge opportunity for us, since we land deals in the eight and nine digits,” he says. 
 According to its financial statements, One saw a big bump in its broadcasting revenue, which went from S$4.7 million (US$3.4 million) in 2017 to SS$19.7 million (US$14.1 million) in 2018. 
 Future plans 
 Sityodtong tells  Tech in Asia  that One is gunning for deals with more high-profile broadcasters. It’s also setting its sights on outstripping US football league NFL, which is worth about  US$91 billion , to become the world’s most valuable sports property. 
 “We’ve already overtaken the Ultimate Fighting Championship in terms of online viewership. Just the NBA and NFL stand in our way,” says Sityodtong. 
 “You may see us churning out event after event and content after content. But at the heart of it all, our crown jewel is our sports property,” he adds. “In a perfect world, what would Disney or Amazon want to own as an asset? If they could, they would want to buy the NFL and the NBA, as they are incredible sports franchises that will keep up making money.” 
 Sityodtong cites ESPN’s deal with Netflix for Michael Jordan’s  The Last Dance  documentary to shed some light on his moonshot idea for One. “You need platform businesses that are heavy on intellectual property and very asset light. With that, you have the flexibility to make a lot of different content,” he says. 
 One Championship recently branched out into esports, but judging by its Facebook reach, that effort is still nascent. In December, the company launched its first event in this vertical, the Dota 2 Singapore World Pro Invitational, to a “surprising” reception, according to One Esports CEO Carlos Alimurung.

 The tournament received more than 464,000 peak concurrent views, which isn’t a bad showing for an inaugural, especially when pitted against numbers pulled by League of Legends European Championship, which  attracted 807,033 concurrent viewers  across the world at its peak. 
 Alimurung says that One’s esports arm is on track to be profitable by 2021. The firm will also add “two to three” popular titles like Mobile Legends and Dota 2 to its lineup next year. 
 Apart from hosting esports tournaments, One is looking to develop its own games. But that comes with its own set of challenges as there’s no guarantee that the company can create a hit game that can recoup the production costs. 
 According to Sityodtong, One is taking “baby steps” towards this goal, starting with introducing two mini games its mobile app, which will feature “small adventure and quiz challenges.” He considers these moves as “fan service” – a way to keep fans engaged. “We get to speak to them loudly,” he says. 
 The company also intends to use the mini games as an experiment before delving into a major gaming project that Sityodtong mentioned during a recent  fireside chat  with Maria Li,  Tech in Asia’s  chief operating officer. 
 “We will launch a big video game in two years. Yes, it can be a hit and miss, and that’s why we have to start small with mobile projects,” he said during the discussion. 
 Despite Covid-19 putting a damper on its business, One says an initial public offering is still in the pipeline. “The time to go live [on the stock market] depends on the global economy. I can’t tell you exactly when, but it will still happen,” Sityodtong says.

650000,ByteDance’s Q1 revenue said to jump to $5.6b," Chinese tech giant  ByteDance  has recorded roughly 40 billion yuan (US$5.6 billion) in revenue for the first quarter of 2020,  Reuters  reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. 
 The result represents a year-on-year growth of more than 130% for the company, one of the sources said.

 According to the other person, the TikTok owner and operator has set a 2020 revenue target of around 200 billion yuan (US$28.2 billion), while the first source said it aims to reach revenues that’s around half of rival Tencent’s, which reported nearly 377 billion yuan (US$53.2 billion) last year. 
  Tech in Asia  reached out to ByteDance but a spokesperson for the company declined to comment. 
 In May,  Bloomberg  reported that ByteDance had recorded a net profit of more than US$3 billion last year. The company had also generated over US$17 billion in revenue for full-year 2019, more than double the US$7.4 billion it raked in the year prior. 
 The spike was driven by a significant jump in user traffic that lured advertisers from Tencent and Baidu, the report mentioned. 
 Carrying that momentum into 2020, the company has started investing in a number of different verticals. 
 In January, it was reported that ByteDance built its own  gaming division  to take on market leader Tencent.  Bloomberg  said that the company had formed a team of more than 1,000 people, which includes the core developer team of NetEase-linked Pangu Game, to develop non-casual mobile games.

 With the latest capital injection, the company has now raised a total of US$15.2 billion in  two months . 
 PIF joins Jio’s other investors such as Facebook, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, TPG, and L Catterton. Jio’s other backers from the Middle East include Abu Dhabi-based sovereign investment firm Mubadala and a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. 
 According to a statement, the investment in Jio is PIF’s biggest funding to date, valuing the digital services firm at US$65 billion. The fund, which acts as the main investment arm of Saudi Arabia, focuses on investing in long-term opportunities domestically and internationally. 
 It looks to drive the country’s economic transformation as part of  Vision 2030  objectives, which was rolled out in 2016 to reduce its dependence on oil and diversify its economy.

649955,Singapore fintech startup raises seed funding to digitize corporate loans," Singapore-based  iLex , which aims to transform the corporate lending market, announced that it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding from strategic investors in France, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the US. 
 
  Bertrand Billon, CEO and founder of iLex / Photo credit: iLex 
 
 The startup, which was launched just last year, wants to create an end-to-end digital trading platform for primary  syndicated loans  and  secondary loans . To do this, it plans to create a data analytics tool to help participants make informed credit decisions. As transactions increasingly go online, it also aims to automate deal workflows and offer secure online trading and communications. 
 The market participants it currently supports include banks, private debt funds, pension funds, asset managers, life insurers, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds, among others. 
 The new funds, iLex said, will be used to develop the first version of its platform, which will feature its own AI matching engine, trading protocols, and data analytics tool. 
  What problem is it solving?  While digitization has already occurred for some asset classes like equities and foreign exchanges, the corporate loan market still largely relies on inefficient manual processes, iLex CEO and founder Bertrand Billon said. 
 According to the company, the pain points in the market are evident: constrained market reach due to limited resources, lack of liquidity in secondary lending, low-level price discovery, limited market data, and compliance and operational risks. 
 To tackle these issues, the startup’s digital solutions will help users access global deals through its AI matching system, the company said in a statement. The firm will also automate trading execution – through productivity tools and a centralized audit trail – and will offer real-time data visualization as well as loan pricing and benchmarking mechanisms so users can gain deep market insights. 
 “I believe our difference lies in the technology that is driving our solutions and data offerings and, importantly, our strategic partnerships with industry players,” Billon said. 
 The company has so far formed partnerships with London-based information provider IHS Markit and financial data provider Refinitiv. 
  What’s the opportunity?  In Asia Pacific, the primary syndicated loans market was worth around US$700 billon last year, while the secondary loans market was estimated at around US$50 billon, according to iLex. 
 Over the last five years, there have been 1,200 active lenders and over 12,000 borrowers in the region accessing capital through syndicated transactions. 
 But while corporate lending drives the overall economy, being the second-largest source of funding for businesses, less than 1% of fintech investments have gone into this sector, iLex observed. The company therefore positions itself as a pioneer in digitizing the industry. 
  What are its challenges?  As with any other digital marketplace, iLex recognizes that it has to work hard to drive the adoption of its platform and increase deal flow and volumes. 
 To do this, it will focus on attracting and retaining sell-side arrangers and buy-side investors to become a “must-have” tool for market participants, the company said. 
  How much traction is it targeting?  The startup will continue ramping up user adoption and growing its transaction volume as it prepares to officially launch its platform in October this year. 
 It’s currently onboarding international banks in Asia Pacific and looks to gain over 100 market participants by the end of 2021. 
  Who are the team members?  The iLex team consists of members with working experience at several global financial institutions such as the Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Westpac Banking Corporation, Citibank, and Deutsche Bank. 
 Billon leads iLex together with Marc Verlet, the company’s chief operating officer, and business development head Arnaud Teissier. ",Doris Yu,1,3,"[(0, 0.29017085), (2, 0.26441896), (3, 0.4453288)]","['iLex', 'Citibank']","['US', 'Singapore', 'London', 'AI', 'France']"
649861,APAC’s smartphone market a growing opportunity for ecommerce players," Smartphones have become an indispensable part of our everyday lives, and nowhere is this more pronounced than in the Asia Pacific region, which has roughly 1.5 billion smartphone users. Indeed, smartphones have become the dominant way of accessing the internet in many parts of the region, recently surpassing PC connections for the first time. 
   
 With a sizable, ever-growing base of smartphone users comes demand – a lot of it. Each year, over 500 million smartphones are sold in the region. 
 While most of the sales today are still conducted through “traditional” channels (e.g., through telecommunications carriers, specialized electronics stores, and mom and pop shops), a combination of industry trends is shifting demand away from these platforms. These include government regulations that curtail device and mobile plan bundling, and a precipitous increase in preference for online shopping among consumers. 
 As such, ecommerce firms like Lazada, Shopee, Tokopedia, and Rakuten are now uniquely positioned to tap into one of APAC’s most deeply rooted and voluminous industries. 
 In particular, five innovations that are unique to ecommerce allow the digital platform to fully leverage the opportunity and revolutionize consumer shopping. 
 Endless options 
 With a catalog consisting of tens of thousands of mobile device selections, ecommerce players like Lazada provide consumers with an endless array of options, filtered by literally every user preference possible: RAM, price, screen size, battery type, processor type, etc. 
 Nowhere else will consumers get a more exhaustive list of options to choose from, available within the few seconds it takes to click one’s product preferences and for the page to refresh. Optionality when it comes to smart devices is vital today, as the market has become hypercompetitive and the smallest differences between products can set them apart from one another. 
 Convenience 
 Consider this: Approximately 80% of consumers that shop for smartphones in a traditional brick and mortar store go online – often when they’re already in the shop – to do research before deciding on a final purchase. 
 By resorting to ecommerce instead of going to physical stores, the vast majority of smartphone buyers will benefit from being able to conduct a more convenient and more thorough pre-purchase research, an indispensable step in the purchase journey. 
 “Always-on” promotions 
 It’s hard to dispute the sheer scalability and prevalence of ecommerce sales promotions and online shopping festivals that lure in consumers with insanely attractive and cost-saving opportunities. During 2019’s Single’s Day, for example, many top smartphone models were paired with discounts of  up to 40% . 
 Furthermore, merchants are increasingly experimenting with purchase  incentive bundles , such as offering free trial subscriptions for Netflix or Spotify with the purchase of select devices. Ecommerce makes it easy to deploy such promotions by implementing them at scale, allowing seamless user redemption (e.g., online link or redemption code) and launching in-site recommendations/targeting ads to reach the right consumers. 
 User engagement 
 User engagement is key in today’s world of consumerism where buyers are increasingly looking for immersive, interactive, and social experiences in their path to purchase. 
 This is especially true with smartphones, given the emotional purchase drivers involved. Ecommerce enables more scalable and innovative ways of driving user engagement in the purchase journey through different ways: 
 
 Players can collaborate with local influencers to drive purchase intent via unboxing/education reviews, coupled with links that seamlessly lead buyers to the product listing. Take for example  this Lazada unboxing video  or  this influencer video  that directs users to visit a Taiwanese ecommerce platform. 
 Firms can introduce “gamified” shopping experiences, often with shopping coupons as prizes. Lazada’s Shake It, Slash It, and Wonderland in-app games are good examples. 
 They can also create immersive experiences where consumers can interact with “social sellers” and participate in live online auctions alongside other potential buyers. 
 
 Measurement and testing 
 Ecommerce enables merchants to effectively gauge consumer sentiment and behavior in real time. Subsequently, sellers are able to more effectively fine-tune marketing messages, services, and product placements to better serve consumers. 
 With ecommerce, merchants can: 
 
 Set up brand-specific  landing pages/microsites  and conduct extensive A/B tests to determine the most effective page layout, marketing messages, etc. 
 Conduct digital consumer surveys at check-out to gather valuable and actionable feedback on user experience, product offerings, attractiveness of promotional offerings, etc. 
 Compare performance across a large range of similar or competing products on a particular ecommerce site. Ultimately, this leads to increased competitiveness and, by extension, more value for consumers. 
 
 But beyond these core strengths, the Covid-19 outbreak has also all but reinforced the importance of online shopping platforms. In Singapore, for example, nearly  two in five  consumers have engaged in increased levels of online shopping since the outbreak began, with electronics purchases seeing the largest increase among non-FMCG products. 
 Beyond the current health crisis’ immediate impact, it’s likely that consumers are building shopping behaviors that will carry on long after the pandemic “ends.” For example, among the roughly 40% of consumers who’ve increased their online shopping,  more than 75%  indicated that they would sustain these uplifted levels post-pandemic, mostly driven by their new reinforced habits as well as a lingering unease at visiting public retail stores. 
 Indeed, as we adjust to the new normal, ecommerce and the many innovations it embodies will unquestionably emerge as a more deeply entrenched part of the consumer purchase experience in Asia Pacific.

649941,14 out of 21 digibank contenders in Singapore move to the next round," The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today announced that 14 out of 21 digital bank applications will progress to the next stage of assessment. 
 The 14 applications were comprised of five digital full bank applicants and nine digital wholesale bank contenders.

 In the next stage of assessment, the eligible applicants will be invited to present their proposals via virtual meetings, with candidates being shortlisted based on their value proposition, business model, innovative use of technology, and the ability to manage a sustainable digibank business, MAS said. The applicants will also be evaluated based on growth prospects and other contributions to Singapore’s financial center. 
 In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, MAS has asked the applicants to review their business plans and assumptions underpinning their financial projections, including funding sources, and provide an independent review of these assumptions. 
 The financial regulator said it does not expect this request to affect the timeline for awarding the licenses, which is scheduled by the end of the year. 
 In June 2019, the agency announced that it would issue up to two digital full bank licenses and three digital wholesale bank licenses. In January this year, a total of 21 applications – seven for digital full banking and 14 for digital wholesale banking – were received by MAS.

 Some players competing for the full bank license include a  Grab and Singtel  consortium, Razer Youth Bank, and Sea Group, among others. Meanwhile, an AMTD and Xiaomi consortium, Alibaba’s Ant Financial, and a Temasek-backed group are gunning for a wholesale digital banking license.

 The startup said it will use the new funds to expand into new markets such as Java and Bali by the end of this year. It will also develop its supply chain network of logistics hubs and experience centers. 
  What is its funding history?   
 
 
 Seed round  (2015): US$500,000 from 500 Startups (lead), KK Fund, IMJ Investment Partners, Freecharge’s Sandeep Tandon, and TheAsianparent’s Roshni Mahtani 
 
 Series A round  (2016): US$2 million from Venturra Capital (lead), 500 Startups, and IMJ Investment Partners 
 Series B round (2018): US$6.5 million led by Aavishkaar Capital 
 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Since its series B fundraise two years ago, the company said it has increased its user base by 5x and business-to-customer revenues by 4x. It also added 17 experience centers and roughly tripled its website traffic. 
 Fabelio co-founder Christian Sutardi said that the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the company’s online sales, which peaked in April. The company claims that it has achieved an 82% year on year growth in customer acquisition, with more than 1,000 B2B projects. 
 Fabelio, which is addressing the US$6.7 billion home and living market in Indonesia, also said that its unit economics have been positive since late 2017 and is on track to hit profitability by 2022. 
  What challenges has it faced recently?  “After five years of operations, scaling up and defining our unique ‘new retail’ strategy, it was crucial for us to double down on our growth drivers,” Fabelio told  Tech in Asia . 
 Its seed round allowed the company to prove that Indonesians are willing to buy furniture online. Then, with series A money, the company was able to improve its tech stack and experiment with the “new retail” approach, which combines online and offline platforms. 
 After closing its series B round, it started optimizing its operations, including supply chain, warehousing, and logistics as well as building out a network of experience centers. 
 To date, Fabelio has launched three domestic offices and 20 showrooms with a staff of 430. 
  What are its future plans?  This year, the company will primarily focus on increasing market share by scaling its engineering team, continuing its online marketing efforts, further developing its product, and improving its operations. 
 It also seeks regional investors in Southeast Asia and China to conclude its series C round by the end of the year. ",Doris Yu,0,3,"[(1, 0.10374554), (3, 0.8879765)]","['AppWork', 'Java', 'AppWorks', 'Ikea', 'TheAsianparent', 'Telkom']","['Asia', 'Fabelio', 'Indonesia', 'China']"

649779,Malaysian fintech startup Curlec gets 500 Startups backing,"  Curlec , a Malaysia-based fintech company, said it has raised an undisclosed amount of investment from 500 Startups. This follows the company’s  seed round  last year, which was led by Captii Ventures. 
 
  Curlec co-founder and CEO Zac Liew / Photo credit: Curlec 
 
  Launched in early 2018, C  urlec helps businesses collect recurring payments and manage their cash flow more easily. It offers an API that facilitates direct debit bank-to-bank payments and automates the collection workflow.  
 The startup will use the new funds primarily to scale its team and operations in its home market as it ramps up sales and focuses on merchant acquisition for its target industries such as education, financial services, and property management. 
 It also looks to add more payment types to its solution and develop banking and software integration partnerships to help it scale in Southeast Asia eventually. 
  How is it different?  Many businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, still struggle with managing their cash flow and getting paid on time. 
 “Some of the stats are scary: In Malaysia, over 30% of businesses have less than one month cash in the bank and, on average, it takes around 90 days to get invoices paid. This has been particularly magnified during [the Covid-19] lockdown,” Zac Liew, CEO and co-founder of Curlec, told  Tech in Asia . 
 Traditional payment options such as cash, check, bank transfers, and credit cards haven’t been effective in solving this pain point, Liew said. Instead, he sees great potential in direct debit, which is an automated payment method that allows merchants to pull payments directly from their customers’ bank accounts. 
 The concept of direct debit has been in Malaysia for many years, but only large companies have access to it, as they have the resources to deal with the cumbersome and paper-based processes involved. Liew believes that this leaves SMEs underserved. Curlec is now bringing direct debit online so that even SMEs can take advantage of this payment type. 
 Some established names in the region offering similar solutions include Stripe, Revolut, and Ezypay. According to Liew, while other players are more focused on ecommerce and e-wallet transactions, Curlec targets direct debit payments. 
 “This is an area that nobody else here has been focusing on and is a differentiator for us,” he added. 
  What are its challenges?  Curlec has to educate businesses that direct debit is the “best way” to collect payments, get paid on time, and take control of their cash flow, said the CEO. It also has to convince consumers that its solution is a safe, secure, and a convenient way to pay. 
  What’s the opportunity?  The startup aims to build an end-to-end product for managing recurring payments and looks to enter the subscription economy soon. 
 According to Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company, the digital payments sector in Southeast Asia is expected to reach  US$1 trillion  by 2025. Meanwhile, the global subscription economy is estimated to reach  US$530 billion  this year. 
 For now, Curlec generates revenue by charging a payment transaction fee and subscription fees. With maximum charges set at 1% per transaction and capped at US$2.34, it claims that its service is cheaper than some international card networks. 
 “From day one, we’ve always set out to build a sustainable company that doesn’t burn cash like crazy,” said Liew, adding that the company is aiming to hit profitability this year. 
 Amid Covid-19, the company said it has seen a surge in traditional businesses switching from offline to online. Moreover, more merchants are turning to subscription-based business models to obtain predictable revenue and take control of cash flow. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Curlec currently serves over 300 businesses including AXA Affin Life Insurance, telecom conglomerate Axiata Group Berhad, and online investment management company StashAway, among others. 
 It also claims to have processed over US$50 million worth of transactions since its inception. And despite the lockdown in Malaysia, its transaction volume continues to grow by 20% month on month, said Liew. 
  Who are the team members?  Liew built Curlec with Steve Kucia, who has extensive experience in banking technology and was also the managing director of information technology company Unisys in Hong Kong. Liew, on the other hand, previously worked at multinational financial company Barclays. 
 Raj Lorenz, who was formerly group CEO of payments company GHL, is also part of Curlec as an early investor and board advisor. ",Doris Yu,0,3,"[(0, 0.879231), (3, 0.12063824)]","['Liew', 'Stripe', 'Unisys', 'Google', 'StashAway']","['Asia', 'Curlec', 'Malaysia']"
649582,This Singapore-based regtech startup is solving the age-old problem of  money laundering," In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, while working at JPMorgan Chase, Abhishek Chatterjee witnessed the increasing pressures placed on banks by regulators. 
 The crisis had led to the enactment of stricter regulations around the world to monitor banks’ activities more closely and ensure accountability. 
 “What I realized is that regulatory compliance is a critical aspect of a banking business; it’s not just a support function,” says Chatterjee. 
 The experience inspired him to launch the Singapore-based regulatory technology company  Tookitaki  in 2014 with co-founder Jeeta Bandopadhyay, in a bid to help financial institutions build sustainable compliance programs. 
 The price of noncompliance 
 According to Chatterjee, managing compliance risk is vital for banks to uphold their reputation. 
 Not adhering to regulatory requirements can also cost these institutions a pretty penny. Banks were hit with  US$10 billion worth of fines  in a 15-month period through 2019 for various infractions, such as violating money laundering rules and transacting with sanctioned countries.

 “Banks overall are not really prepared for how regulations are changing [and] how the data is changing,” explains Chatterjee. “They’re still in a very rule-based mode of looking and applying regulatory changes in the environment.” 
 Next-generation solutions 
 Money laundering has been an issue for years. However, financial services firms have mostly focused on looking at simple transactional behaviors, relying heavily on rule-based, if-then systems to flag cases. 
 This has not been effective, as over  95% of flagged transactions are false positives , which means manpower is still required to identify genuine cases. 
 Additionally, with rule-based systems, criminals can learn the rules and circumvent them. 
 With Tookitaki’s Anti-Money Laundering Software (AMLS), this is no longer the case. The solution relies on machine learning algorithms to enable banks to effectively monitor and screen transactions by highlighting unusual behavior. 
 It is able to learn from each incident how to discover money laundering patterns easily and enable banks to make better, quicker decisions. 
 This is useful for cases where uncovering fraud is difficult. Human trafficking rings, for instance, may register their victims as self-employed individuals and use them to carry out cash withdrawals and bank transactions in various countries. 
 “This sort of pattern would be quite different from that of a legitimate business owner,” Chatterjee explains. While the bank may be able to flag the case and inform regulators, it is easy for criminals to shift their activities to another bank that may be unaware of this particular tactic. 
 AMLS pools all the data it receives from across Tookitaki’s different clients and learns from the different flagged events, building up its database of money laundering scenarios. This enables the software to cover a wide range of bases, helping financial institutions comply with regulations while thwarting criminal activities. 
 Gaining recognition 
 AMLS bagged the silver award in the most promising innovation category at the 2019  SG:D Techblazer Awards . The awards are jointly organized by the  Infocomm Media Development Authority  and  SGTech .

 Tookitaki had previously seen some recognition in the financial space, and is  working with the United Overseas Bank  to deploy its solutions. But through the media coverage it obtained from winning the award, Tookitaki was able to get its name out into the wider market. 
 The accolade also served as a stamp of approval, indicating to other businesses that Tookitaki is a trustworthy company that delivers results. 
 “In the banking business, it’s all about the brand, the comfort, and the confidence people have in you,” Chatterjee says. 
 The award’s rigorous selection process, which involved giving multiple pitches to different panelists, helped sharpen the team’s pitching skills. These skills have come in handy during talks with potential investors and clients. 
 Plans for the future 
 Having secured  US$19.2 million in series A funding  in 2019, Tookitaki has ambitious plans. 
 The company is looking to double down on its expansion efforts in North America, where it already has one office, and in Asia Pacific, especially in India and Singapore. It’s also working toward developing more effective solutions to assist financial institutions in regulatory compliance. 
 “The bad guys out there have more money and are better prepared,” says Chatterjee. “We need to innovate so that we can keep on beating them and really make the world a better place.” 
 
 The  SG:D Techblazer Awards  is Singapore’s highest accolade for tech innovation. It aims to recognize and endorse companies based in the city-state that exemplify the spirit of innovation in the development of tech solutions.

649089,How Pinduoduo’s success serves as a model for the rise of social ecommerce,"  This article was co-authored by Nic Dardenne.  
 With Covid-19 forcing us to remain confined in our homes, we’ve modified our social practices. Beyond the social networks we already know and use, we continuously find new ways to integrate social experiences into our online lives. 
 
  Photo credit: Pinduoduo 
 
 At Y Combinator, we are considering what this might mean for the future of ecommerce. For several years now, we’ve had our eye on Pinduoduo. As China gradually recovers from the pandemic’s impact, the company, with its social shopping approach, seems well-poised to fully capture the offline-to-online transition in commerce. 
 A bit of background 
 Pinduoduo’s success in China suggests there is a huge opportunity for social commerce platforms to emerge in other regions. 
 When it launched in 2015, there was little room for a new ecommerce platform. Two major players, JD.com and Taobao/Tmall (both sub brands of Alibaba), were already dominating China’s online commerce, much like how Amazon now dominates the US. In fact, the two companies generated a combined gross merchandise value of US$433 billion that same year. 
 Five years later, Pinduoduo is defying expectations, skyrocketing from a startup to a company worth US$$93.4 billion. Its active buyer base, which numbers 585 million, has generated a gross merchandise value of over US$144 billion within the last twelve months. In 2020, it became China’s second-largest ecommerce platform on an active user basis, just behind Alibaba. 
 Pinduoduo found room in the ecommerce space, not as a competitor to search-based websites like JD.com, but as a new ecommerce platform focused on interactive and digital social shopping experiences. 
 While social shopping online may seem like a new concept, the reality is that shopping, whether online or in the physical world, is meant to be interactive and fun, with purchases informed by friends and family. But ecommerce platforms like JD.com, Alibaba, and Amazon don’t account for this; instead, they focus on efficiency, conversion funnel, and purchase rates. 
 Pinduoduo, on the other hand, has tried to mimic the offline shopping experience by building communities with their team purchase model, driving engagement through interactive games and rewards, and offering personalized experiences and value via recommendations. 
 Consumers’ desire for social engagement while shopping is highlighted by sales projections within different categories in online shopping: Only 29% of apparel, 11% of health &amp; personal care, and 3% of food &amp; beverage purchases were expected to happen digitally in 2020 in the US, compared with the books/music and computer electronics categories, which come in at 55% and 43%, respectively. 
 These numbers reveal that social shopping is particularly important in categories where consumers seek feedback or recommendations from friends. 
 In our view, Pinduoduo’s rapid success in social commerce will be replicated by others globally – a trend that will continue to drive commerce in social-driven categories online. 
 Creating communities via team purchase 
 The core of the Pinduoduo experience is the concept of team purchase, where buyers form a group in order to receive discounts from suppliers. 
 For each item, merchants set two prices: one for individual purchases and one for team purchases. If the user opts for a team purchase, they may either initiate forming a team or join an existing one. In the case of the former, they can either use social platforms such as WeChat to proactively encourage friends to be part of their team, or wait for other buyers to join. 
 A team needs to be formed within 24 hours to have the order approved. Once that’s done, the purchase is confirmed and the product is shipped within 48 hours. 
   
 In addition to driving down prices, team purchases help solve the “trust deficit” in the retail sector of China’s developing cities, where more than 80% of the space is unorganized and consumers rely heavily on social recommendations to initiate transactions. 
 Pinduoduo’s team purchase is often compared with Groupon’s because they both enable a form of group buying, but the two models are actually very different. 
 First, deals on Pinduoduo are designed by sellers but initiated by consumers, whereas Groupon deals are both designed and managed by sellers. Second, Pinduoduo’s team purchase is used for everyday goods that are valuable for consumers vs. one-off products/experiences that haven’t sold well elsewhere. Third, products on Pinduoduo are offered by merchants from across China and, increasingly, from all over the world, in contrast to the mostly local sellers that leverage Groupon to drive customers to their stores/locations. 
 All these result in a much stronger consumer value proposition since users get discounts on goods they need to purchase anyway, as opposed to letting sellers dictate discounts by aggregating demand on low-value goods or excess inventory. 
 To maximize this effect, Pinduoduo launched in the fruits and vegetables category, which was strategic for two reasons: 
 
 Incumbents were focused on non-perishable items, so competition was limited. 
 While they have lower order value, fruits and vegetables are high-frequency goods, which means users have a reason to use Pinduoduo regularly. 
 
 When potential buyers saw a great deal, they would forward it to their neighbors and friends via WeChat to create a team purchase. In return, the group initiator would get produce for free as they helped Pinduoduo acquire more users. With team purchases driving organic sharing, Pinduoduo has been able to grow its user base very quickly. 
 Within one month after launching its first app in January 2016 (prior transactions were made only through WeChat), the company acquired over 10 million customers; four years later, it now has 585 million active buyers. Alibaba, in comparison, crossed the 500 million active buyer threshold 15 years after it had launched its consumer-facing marketplace. 
 The takeaway for startups is that the team purchase model is significant because it enables behaviors associated with offline commerce in an online setting. 
 While Team Purchase may be unique to China today, we expect social e-commerce to be a global phenomenon. New commerce platforms that can leverage social relationships will accelerate the offline to online transition in commerce. 
 However, while this concept was the main reason for Pinduoduo’s rapid growth, a significant enabler of its viral nature was also the widespread use of WeChat in China. WeChat’s parent firm Tencent is a large investor in Pinduoduo, and as a result, it was happy to let the app grow within its ecosystem. 
 Users visit Pinduoduo without any specific intent, much like visiting a real-world shopping mall, where the time that a consumer spends at the mall directly correlates with the amount he or she buys. As such, Pinduoduo has gamified the experience to maximize the amount of time a user spends on the platform. Features that build on this include daily check-ins, price chop, card programs, and mini games. 
 Daily check-ins 
 The daily check-in is a feature prominently displayed on the Pinduoduo home page. It encourages users to open the app daily by rewarding them with redeemable points each time they check in. 
 It’s a simple yet brilliant feature. While each check-in does not generate revenue, the product experience eventually ties back to commerce should users decide to redeem their vouchers. Theoretically, this yields a higher customer lifetime value for the platform. 
   
 Price chop 
 In the app’s price chop section, a user can select goods they want to avail for free, which will set off a 24-hour timer. 
 The user must then share the link with as many friends as possible, and each friend who clicks on it and engages with Pinduoduo – no purchase required – means an incremental discount for the initiator. If not enough contacts are recruited to reduce the price to zero within 24 hours, the user doesn’t get the item for free. 
 This feature mimics the experience of leveling up in a massive online multiplayer game like  World of Warcraft , where the difficulty increases as the player rises in rank. In Pinduoduo’s case, the difficulty is based on the user and the price of the item: Discounts get progressively smaller with each recruited contact as the user gets closer to achieving a new level. 
 Similar to daily check-ins, the price chop encourages people to engage with Pinduoduo. But unlike daily check-ins, it incentivizes them to share the app with their social network, helping it increase customer lifetime value as well as efficiently acquire customers via user-to-user sharing. 
   
 Card program 
 Pinduoduo’s card program is designed to encourage customers to share products among friends and save money through vouchers/special discounts. The app has several different cards that either encourage certain user behaviors or provide utility to a Pinduoduo user; the three most popular ones are the Free Pass Card, the Brand Black Card, and the Brand Card. 
 Similar to a loyalty program, the Free Pass Card allows users to enjoy a team purchase discount without having to join a team. It can be availed after making two purchases. 
   
 The Brand Black Card, on the other hand, encourages customers to leave reviews on the platform by offering discounts on branded products. This is important, as consumers often rely on reviews and recommendations from previous buyers when making purchase decisions. 
   
 Finally, the Brand Card promotes Pinduoduo’s branded products, which consumers can get access to after making a purchase on the app. 
 Users can share their brand cards via WeChat and encourage friends to browse through and buy branded products – an effective incentive for people to buy items they wouldn’t normally purchase, if not for a trusted recommendation. 
 Since Pinduoduo has been used primarily to buy non-branded products, the Brand Card is also an effective mechanism for increasing the company’s branded product market share in China. 
   
 Mini games 
 Pinduoduo’s in-app games motivate users to engage with the app for fun, even if that doesn’t immediately translate into a purchase. 
 The first one to get popular was Duo Duo Orchard, which is like Farmville except with real physical goods as rewards. 
 The game is simple: A user creates and nurtures a virtual fruit tree until it yields a real box of fruit, which would then be shipped to their address. The more they shop, the more water droplets they receive to grow their tree. Duo Duo Orchard now has more than 11 million daily active users. 
   
 The company also recently launched DD Bank, a piggy bank game where users accumulate coins that they can exchange over time. 
 Games like these are ingenious, because rising through their levels motivates user behaviors that drive Pinduoduo’s financial goals and creates a win-win-win situation for merchants, consumers, and the company. 
 Creating value by offering personalized recommendations 
 Unlike search-based platforms, Pinduoduo is highly personalized. Using information such as a user’s friends list and their favorite categories, the platform is able to generate customized recommendations. 
 The aggregated data also allows the company to optimize the items a person encounters on the app, with products that have been recommended or purchased by friends highlighted in their favorite categories. 
 Pinduoduo looks at value for money as a personalization concept as well. Based on a customer’s purchase/browsing history, the platform knows whether they prefer high-cost branded clothing or low-cost non-branded items, and will thus show users only the items that match their willingness to pay. 
 The future of global ecommerce 
 There is a huge opportunity for companies to integrate social aspects into their commerce platforms and subsequently expand ecommerce’s overall share of spend. While the success of the team purchase model may be specific to China’s commercial landscape, the insights raised by Pinduoduo can be applied universally. 
 Founders would do well to treat shopping as a social activity when building their products. Web 1.0 platforms – which include Amazon – optimize for efficiency but don’t serve trust-based categories very well. By building “sharing use cases” and experiences that mimic the fun of real-world shopping, commerce’s offline to online transitions can be accelerated. 
 There are already many indicators that there is a major demand in the US for more sophisticated social commerce. An obvious example is Instagram, which has over 1 billion users and is arguably one of the world’s largest social shopping platforms now. Similar to Pinduoduo, it has fostered a browsing-based feed that often presents products and is accompanied with links for purchasing. 
 The rise of the social media influencer economy alone shows that US consumers are ready to fully engage in social online shopping. 
 In fact, there have already been a few companies that came through Y Combinator and are trying to fill this void. These include a food app for college campuses that has built social experiences into its product, and a reseller marketplace that enables people to sell to their friends and family via WhatsApp and other messaging channels. 
 Of course, companies like Amazon will continue to grow in market share for specific shopping needs, but it’s inevitable that other players will rise to fill the ecommerce social browsing vaccum in the US market. 
 But half-hearted attempts are not going to cut it. After all, social commerce does not just mean connecting user accounts to Facebook; it also means creating new shopping experiences for buyers and sellers online. 
 Meanwhile, Pinduoduo has already gained enough consumer insights that they are able to collaborate with and influence manufacturers in China to cater to their user base. The company’s social commerce model is gaining sophistication and market influence.

 Attempts at restructuring operations are taking its toll on the Singapore-headquartered firm, which had assessed more than 7 million profiles and enabled over US$2 billion in lending in 20-plus countries as of 2018.

 A multimillion-dollar term sheet that was on the table in 2019 seems to have fallen through, says a source familiar with the situation, worsening a cash crunch that has resulted in staff departures across global teams, in addition to pending payments to vendors. 
 That’s just one among the many other challenges facing LenddoEFL, which initially  extended loans to individuals  by using algorithms that assessed creditworthiness. It tried to become a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company by selling its credit-scoring product, but the transformation hasn’t been easy. 
 Employees seem to have borne the brunt of the company’s restructuring efforts, with some going unpaid for months and others being terminated without notice. Former staff that  Tech in Asia  spoke to also bemoaned the lack of communication about operational health and a contentious management hire. 
 Speaking to  Tech in Asia , LenddoEFL chief executive Paolo Montessori confirmed that while there had been staff exits, turnover has been “less than 10%” overall. The startup has been going through a restructuring effort in the past 12 months as it works towards becoming a “serious growth company.” 
 The layoffs 
 In April, LenddoEFL’s team of engineers in the Philippines – over 20 of them, which were hired through business process outsourcing company (BPO)  Infinit-O  – were made redundant as the partnership between both companies ceased, ex-employees affected by the move tell  Tech in Asia . Some staff from its data science team were also affected. 
 “There was literally zero notice period,” says an ex-employee who requested confidentiality. 
 There is nothing extraordinary about that. It’s a company growing up. 
  Online postings show  that the company continues to hire for roles in finance and engineering, and its current headcount stands at 62. 
 In the Philippines, it’s common for multinational companies to recruit local personnel through  BPO companies , which effectively serve as third-party providers. In effect, employees hired through Infinit-O don’t fall under LenddoEFL’s official headcount. “[Infinit-O] is our employer on paper. They pay our salaries, they provide us with government-mandated bonuses and benefits, [and] they file our taxes,” a former employee explains. 
  Tech in Asia  understands that LenddoEFL employees in international offices have also been retrenched. As it consolidated global operations, the startup replaced its finance administration team in Latin America with staff in its corporate headquarters in Singapore. 
 The changes come amid a push towards bringing the startup to a positive cash position, which it’s expecting to achieve within the next year. As a result, this has called for “some difficult decisions to be made,” Montessori says. 
 Some LenddoEFL employees “left voluntarily,” while some, like non-performers, “were asked to leave,” he adds. “There is nothing extraordinary about that. It’s a company growing up.” 
 Senior employees including chief commercial officer Mark Mackenzie were among those who had recently quit the company. He announced in a  LinkedIn post  that he had left two weeks ago, though he didn’t discuss his reasons. 
 A constant pivot 
 Lenddo began in 2011 as a lending business in the Philippines. In 2015, it  pivoted  to focus on credit scoring and verification. 
 Its aim is to drive financial inclusion in underbanked and unbanked markets while helping lenders analyze credit risks with better speed and accuracy. The company’s clients are mainly banks and financial institutions, including Canada-based Scotiabank and Bancolumbia in South America.

 To do credit scoring, the startup analyzes non-traditional data points obtained from smartphone data, digital profiles, and psychometric assessments. The credit scores are then incorporated into the decision-making process of clients through application programming interfaces (APIs). 
 In 2017, the startup rebranded to LenddoEFL following a merger with Entrepreneurial Finance Lab (EFL), a psychometric credit-scoring company that was originally a research initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School. 
 While the merger expanded the company’s footprint to over 20 emerging markets globally, it may have also spread itself too thin. By early 2019, LenddoEFL exited India as it trimmed down operations to markets that “made sense,” says a former employee who didn’t want to be named. 
 At present, LenddoEFL’s core markets include Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. In Latin America, it’s focused on Mexico, Columbia, and Peru. Business is “growing significantly” in Africa, Montessori says. 
 Culture clash 
 The 2017 merger, however, complicated things. An ex-staff, who was originally from EFL and had also worked at the combined entity, describes EFL as the “brain” while Lenddo was the “rockstar” sibling with the marketing know-how. 
 An increased focus on commercialization after the merger came at the cost of EFL’s original social mission. 
   
 According to the source, many joined EFL because they believed that it was set up for the “greater good of humanity” and that its technology could help developing countries. “It sounds altruistic, but there are startups like that, and EFL was one of them,” the person adds. 
 That, however, was soon supplanted by a mentality of scaling and building the company to gain “quick success.” Amid the changes, many EFL employees were made redundant, leading to a “brain drain” as people who understood the product and knew how to sell it were replaced with new employees. 
 “It was a shame because a lot of know-how and intellectual knowledge resided with the EFL side,” the source notes. 
 A scaling problem 
 Even after the merger, LenddoEFL didn’t have a good understanding of the business and unit economics, an ex-staff with knowledge of the matter claims. 
 The company started off by serving small financial institutions and fintech companies, but it realized later on that these clients lacked the scale required to validate its scoring methodology. To achieve that, it decided to transition into a business-to-business, SaaS company. 
 The product was not an easy-to-sell, plug-in product. 
 But the shift wasn’t so simple as customization is often required to serve large banks and financial institutions. “Selling to banks is hard. Selling to a bank when you’re working in a core area of the business – credit risk – is even harder,” says the former employee. 
 Another sticking point was how “the actual service model was not SaaS,” adds the source. “The product was not an easy-to-sell, plug-in product.” 
 This meant a lengthy sales process as well as more effort to ensure customer success and to prove the quality of decisions made. 
 “You’d spend six months selling to a customer – maybe longer – then six months implementing, [another] six months on data collection, [and] six months waiting for it to prove itself out. It’s a long process to realize value,” explains the source. 
 Even a third party that has a product with solid technology and analytics might find it hard to win over a bank. “If you’re a bank, you might just want to do it on your own,” the person points out. 
 A rival platform that declined to be named says that in the last eight to 12 months, it has stopped bumping heads with LenddoEFL during client pitches. “In the past, they used to be way more aggressive,” the competitor observes. 
 A contentious hire 
 In April 2019, Montessori took over the helm of LenddoEFL from Lenddo co-founder Richard Eldridge. This set off a chain of fresh management hires, including chief financial officer Paul Devine and a new chief operating officer. Montessori describes both as “strong professionals.” 
 However, the circumstances around Devine’s hiring drew whispers among the staff. 
 It was thought that Devine would bring in new money – a multimillion dollar investment deal – to the company, but it’s unclear if it has materialized. Montessori declined to comment on the matter. 
 The question was never asked by an employee. 
 Regular updates on the company’s fundraising effort have also dwindled. In the absence of any communication about it, the reasons behind Devine’s hiring remained shrouded in mystery. 
 Employees question the credentials of Devine, who had been fired from his post as chief executive at Alaskan oil and gas company NordAq Energy in 2017 over  allegations that he misappropriated company funds , reported  Anchorage Daily News . 
 Devine didn’t respond to  Tech in Asia ’s requests for comment. 
 Montessori thinks there was “absolutely” no need to justify the hiring decision to employees at any point in the process. “We certainly did our due diligence on him, and the board and the company [was] very comfortable that there’s no wrongdoing on this part,” he says. “The question was never asked by an employee.” 
 He continues, “Yes, there was a lawsuit. Yes, it was unjustified… Yes, it has been settled and yes, it’s closed.” 
 Running dry 
 Despite going through what Montessori describes as a “challenging cash flow period” as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the company is now in a good cash position. 
 “We’re not burning a significant amount of cash. We have 62 employees, and that’s 80% of our overheads. We’re burning a small amount on a monthly basis [and] we’ve reduced our overheads quite significantly,” the CEO says.

 But  Tech in Asia ’s conversations with ex-staff reveal that some workers and vendors haven’t been paid for months. 
 A former employee, who isn’t authorized to speak to the media, was terminated in May for “no reason” after not receiving any salary since March. The employee received “no notifications about the situation.” 
 LenddoEFL also has outstanding payments with BPO company Infinit-O, employees say, and it’s unclear if they’ve been settled. Infinit-O did not respond to  Tech in Asia ’s request for comment. 
 Montessori, however, denies these claims. “We have no problem meeting our business obligations,” he says. 
  Tech in Asia  reached out to LenddoEFL investors Kickstart Ventures, Life.Sreda, Omidyar Network, and Golden Gate Ventures for comment but didn’t receive a response. 
 A communication vacuum 
 Communication between the management team and employees in the last few months has been patchy at best, according to former and existing LenddoEFL employees. 
 “They [the management] haven’t been transparent on what’s happening, so we don’t have any idea if it’s getting resolved or not,” said a source from the company’s offices in Southeast Asia, referring to outstanding invoices to a vendor. 
 It’s not clear what’s happening at LenddoEFL. 
 The sudden retrenchments came as a surprise to some employees. “[We were told that] if we kept our clients, we were OK. We not only kept them but also closed other deals,” said a source from the international office, referencing a review plan that was shared with the staff in 2019. 
 Communication lines between the management team and staff were abruptly cut off towards the end of last year, the source claims. 
 “We used to receive monthly notifications about the company situation. Actually, we received several emails with good news about funding… but suddenly, nobody knew about the funding [anymore],” says a staff member in one of the company’s international offices. 
 Montessori counters that the company’s communication channels have stayed open, but pandemic-induced lockdowns have reduced his frequency of travel. He was speaking to  Tech in Asia  from Melbourne, Australia, where he has been in lockdown for the past three months. The CEO is usually based in Singapore. 
 “We communicate with our staff regularly as most businesses do. We have monthly team meetings [where] we discuss what’s happening with the company with regards to operations [and] fundraising,” he stresses. 
 For the most part, employees have been left scratching their heads over the fate of the company. “I don’t know. Today, it is not clear what’s happening at LenddoEFL,” one staff member says.

649722,Refurbished devices marketplace Reebelo bags seed funding,"  Reebelo , a marketplace for pre-loved devices, has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding in a round led by Germany-based June Fund. 
 
  Reebelo co-founders Philip Franta (left) and Rastouil Fabien / Photo credit: Antler 
 
 Early-stage VC firm Antler also participated in the round, according to a statement. Singapore-based Reebelo was part of Antler’s  third cohort  of startups and was a graduate of HyperSpark, StartupX’s sustainability pre-accelerator run in partnership with investment giant Temasek. 
 According to a 2018 study by the National Environment Agency of Singapore, the city-state produces 60,000 tons of e-waste annually, and only 6% of that gets recycled. To help reduce that number, Reebelo’s recommerce marketplace enables consumers in Singapore to buy or sell used smartphones, tablets, and notebooks. 
 Recommerce, or reverse commerce, refers to the buying and selling of pre-owned goods, mainly electronic devices. 
  How is the startup different?  Some recommerce players in Asia include Moby and Red White Mobile in Singapore, Budli in India, and Laku6 in Indonesia. 
 At its core, Reebelo is a company that buys used electronics from enterprises and individuals and then refurbishes and tests the devices before listing them on the website. The registered secondhand goods dealer also offers extended warranties to give customers peace of mind. 
 Under its partnership with environmental charity One Tree Planted, the startup said that one tree is planted for every device sold on its platform. 
  What are its challenges?  So far, most people upgrade their devices once newer models are released, a spokesperson for the company told  Tech in Asia.  Nowadays, broken devices are also thrown away rather than repaired. 
 The company aims to change this behavior by allowing customers to sell their used devices for cash, giving their older gadgets a new lease on life. 
 “Reebelo’s ambitious vision is to build the circular economy for electronics,” Philip Franta, founder and CEO at Reebelo, said. “[We’re trying] to change the way people consume tech devices at a more sustainable pace – one device at a time.” 
  What’s the opportunity?  Reebelo’s addressable market size in the region, according to the company, stands at US$4.2 billion. To capture a larger share of this, the startup aims to expand into new business lines such as device rentals and offer bundled business phones and laptops for companies. 
 It also plans to enter other markets across Asia Pacific and add support for more electronics categories in the future. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  The startup claims to have served more than 210,000 users on its platform since January and is “aiming to keep growing in a sustainable way month on month.” 
  Who are the team members?  The startup was founded just last year by Franta and Rastouil Fabien. 
 Franta previously served as chief business development officer for German healthtech firm Media4Care, while chief product officer Fabien served as an innovation consultant in France.

649763,10 tech investment winners for a post-Covid world," While the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic is undeniable, data reported by key companies reveal that there are specific segments of the tech industry that are crushing it right now. 
 Sure, we will gradually go back to physical shopping and face-to-face interactions once the virus situation eases, but we will continue to use tech far more than we had used to. 
 The pandemic has helped us collectively shake off old brick-and-mortar habits and accelerate structural digital trends that would have taken years to develop otherwise. Here are 10 that will continue to thrive in a post-Covid-19 world. 
 1. Telemedicine 
 Telemedicine usage has spiked amid the pandemic. In particular, daily active users for remote medicine services have increased across Southeast Asia and Australia. Singapore-based Doctor Anywhere and MyDoc, for example, saw a 156% and 147% year-on-year increase, respectively, while Halodoc in Indonesia saw a 100% jump in March.

 This trend will persist long after the Covid-19 pandemic has passed, as more consumers realize the enhanced safety measures and convenience telemedicine services provide. For one, doctors are able to screen their patients’ basic health issues simply by communicating with them online. And with the ubiquity of thermometers nowadays, patients can easily provide data to healthcare professionals. 
 On the patients’ end, they don’t have to physically visit a clinic or the hospital whenever they feel ill, especially when what they need are only some pain relievers and rest. 
 2. Robotics and automation 
 Industrial automation is another trend that is likely to get even faster adoption. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers recently conducted a survey among businesses regarding their views on fourth industrial revolution or 4IR technologies, such as factory automation and the internet of things. Of the respondents, 63% believe that these help provide protection during economic downturns. 
 After the experience of having to shut down operations during lockdown, factories are now more likely to accelerate their investment into using autonomous and contactless technologies to future-proof their production lines, especially in a post-pandemic but still socially distant world.

 For example, Singapore-headquartered Cognicept uses remote teleoperators to oversee its clients’ robots in industries such as hospitality and logistics. Humans take control for only 1% of the time, usually when a robot gets confused or lost. This enables robots to succeed in many use cases where their error rates are too high to allow complete 100% automation. 
 “Covid-19 has presented a lot of challenges. Aside from [its] tragic health impacts, the pandemic has exposed a lot of fragility in the systems that drive our economy,” says Cognicept CEO Mike Sayre. “Labor force disruption, supply chain breakdowns, and the safety of frontline workers have all driven an accelerated exploration of robotic solutions.” 
  See:  This tech could be the secret ingredient to the mass adoption of robots   
 Cognicept has seen increasing demand, he adds. “We have seen inquiries for UV disinfection robots, delivery robots in quarantine facilities, cleaning robots, and logistics robots, to name a few.” 
 Other companies that are likely to benefit from faster adoption of industrial automation services include Alibaba (through its smart logistics subsidiary Cainiao), JD.com, and Amazon. 
 3. Remote work supervision 
 As remote work becomes the norm, some startups are now offering innovative – and sometimes counterintuitive – solutions in this area. 
 Australia- and New York City-based Tulu offers software that allows companies to remotely manage manual labor that usually requires heavy on-site supervision and guidance. Effective remote management in general has become necessary, but remote supervision of cleaning services have particularly become essential, leading to a surge in demand for Tulu’s solutions. 
 “Cleaners, by habit, miss spots all the time, and 40% of them fail a live audit because of human error. Tulu’s tech platform assists all cleaners to adhere to guidelines and remedy their efforts in real-time, resulting in reductions in human error and increases in worker productivity and safety,” Tulu founder Reza Keshavarzi says. 
 “We enable organizations to oversee more workers across multiple geographies while reducing the need for [on-site] managers and ensuring [everyone’s] health and safety in a post-Covid-19 world.” 
 Team Viewer, a remote access software provider, is also benefiting from work-from-home programs being implemented in various industries. The listed company’s subscribers and billings in the latest quarter both soared by more than 60%.

 4. Online education 
 Online education has been one of the largest beneficiaries of lockdowns across the world. Much of the stigma against it has been removed as more people experience the convenience it provides. 
 Learning online is actually efficient in many ways. A lot of time spent in traditional brick-and-mortar education isn’t exactly “learning,” as many of our old party pictures can attest. 
 Even after lockdowns get lifted, online education will continue to enjoy increased acceptance as learning institutions adopt more online tools to safeguard themselves against future disruptions.

 Iresearch estimates that as online education companies in China monetize their Covid-19 user base gains, the market will continue growing robustly at about 20% a year. Other publicly listed names this sector include New Oriental Education, TAL Education, GSX Techedu, and Youdao.

 5. Virtual meeting apps 
 Perhaps the most ubiquitous development of all has been the increase in usage of conference call platforms, both among consumers and businesses. Apps like Google Meet and Microsoft Teams saw a surge in downloads across multiple countries in the second half of March, over 10x the average rate in Q4 2019. 
 Newer and smaller players have caught the wave and are even showing Big Tech giants how to innovate. Houseparty, for example, came out of nowhere to become one of the most downloaded apps in many Western markets. 
 The company’s innovative inclusion of activities that exist natively within a video call have made large tech companies realize that a true social platform not only allows participants to speak to each other but also share activities together digitally. 
 
  Source: AppAnnie, Zero One 
 
 Australia-based Oper8tor is pushing things in a different direction by developing a patented technology that can connect multiple parties using different calling apps – whether it’s WhatsApp, Skype, or Messenger – into one conference call. The Oper8tor app also allows for the automatic transcription of conversations so that callers receive a text transcript within minutes after a call is completed. 
 “Covid-19 has dramatically increased people’s focus on how to connect most efficiently remotely,” says Oper8tor CEO Angus Parker. “We’re seeing tremendous need for help in professional fields such as banking where audit trails and record-keeping are important. [Companies] can’t always force a customer to use [their] preferred calling app.” 
 Even as the world begins to normalize and reopen, usage of video conferencing is likely to remain high as businesses learn how to further leverage the tool over expensive single-day business trips. 
 With the exception of Zoom as a pure-play video conferencing company, most major video conferencing solutions tend to be under one of the big tech giants: Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tencent. 
 6. Cloud enterprise software 
 Enterprise collaboration and cloud adoption will be major winners as companies migrate their workflows to online to continue engaging with customers even without a brick and mortar presence. Operating digitally and online is now a must-do for businesses – and an overdue one due to its efficiency. 
 Monthly active users for Chinese enterprise collaboration apps DingTalk (Alibaba), WeChat Work (Tencent), and Tencent Meeting grew exponentially from January to March 2020. Even as their growth gets moderated with the lockdown restrictions being eased, enterprise collaboration tools stand to only gain more adoption in the long run as employees and businesses alike see how shifting to digital enhances productivity.

 This trend is not limited to China. It has played out strongly in other parts of the world as well, with companies such as Dropbox and Slack also experiencing increased adoption. 
 Asia-centric names in the enterprise space include Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance while Western names include stocks like Slack and Dropbox. 
 7. Enterprise livestreaming 
 Livestream retail was already hot before Covid-19, but it’s now on the rise. With enterprise collaboration tools allowing employees to remain productive while exercising social distancing, livestreaming has become a powerful engagement channel that brands are leveraging to connect with consumers remotely. 
 While TikTok’s growth has been exponential, “enterprise livestreaming” is set to take off. Iresearch is currently forecasting China’s enterprise livestreaming market to grow by 152% this year. 
 
  Source: Iresearch, Zero One 
 
 Companies like JD.com are directly integrating ecommerce purchase capabilities within livestreaming, allowing viewers to do one-click impulse buys while watching their favorite influencers hawk products. 
 China leads the world in ecommerce innovation, already bringing it to regions such as Southeast Asia. And companies such as Facebook and Alphabet are taking note. We can expect increased livestream ecommerce capabilities in Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Youtube to appear in Western markets as the year progresses. 
 Major names in the listed space for Asia include JOYY and Momo. TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, however, is not yet listed. Meanwhile, Facebook, Alphabet, and Snapchat are the livestreaming players that are expanding in the US. 
 8. Micromobility 
 Public transportation usage took a nosedive by more than 60% around the world as lockdowns kept people at home. Even as it is now showing small signs of early recovery, it’s doubtful that public transportation usage will return to its pre-Covid-19 level as consumers are likely to remain cautious about the health risks it poses. 
   
 Thus, micromobility has an interesting opportunity to capitalize on this transportation gap by offering affordable individual mobility solutions. Niu Technologies CEO Yan Li stated during the company’s last earnings call, “We did observe a demand [for] individual mobility solution as people tended to stay away from public transportation. This trend might increase the total addressable market in a permanent way when people try our electric scooters and start to enjoy the technology, the style, and the freedom our products offer.” 
 While electric vehicle (EV) firms have seen a significant decline in revenue, the pandemic may just have accelerated the shift toward EV micromobility solutions as more people get introduced to these. 
 Listed Asia-centric stocks include Niu Technologies and Yadea while Western names include Uber, Lyft, Lime, and Bird. 
 9. Fresh foods and fast-moving consumer goods ecommerce 
 China’s ecommerce penetration is already one of the highest in the world in terms of dollar value penetration – according to the data from market research company Emarketer, it is at 35% of total retail sales in 2019. 
 We expect this to grow even faster, thanks to the catalyst that was Covid-19, which had propelled consumer behaviors to adapt and even permanently change when it comes to shopping for daily needs online. 
 In Southeast Asia, we’re seeing Lazada’s grocery arm RedMart reporting surging demand. Regional super app Grab has been investing a lot of resources into its groceries delivery business.

 10. Esports and gaming 
 Playing and streaming video games quickly became mainstream staples as sources of digital entertainment amid the pandemic. 
 In April this year, Tencent acquired a controlling stake in Huya while maintaining a 38% stake in DouYu. This has important implications for esports, given the huge portfolio of games that Tencent can leverage for streaming content while it capitalizes on its 1.2 billion strong user ecosystem to drive even faster adoption. 
 The leading game livestreaming platforms in China, Huya saw its mobile monthly active user count surge to 74.7 million in Q1 2020, a 38.6% increase year on year from 53.9 million in the same period of 2019. 
 Asian game developer companies in the listed space include Tencent and NetEase, while game-focused streaming companies include Huya and DouYu. Singapore based Sea Limited, via its Garena gaming arm, has its stock  trading near all-time highs .

 While the Covid-19 pandemic has caused a major negative economic impact overall, there is a benefit to perceiving the problems it has created as opportunities. Problems need solutions, and solutions are what make a business. And that is exactly what the companies in these tech segments are doing.

649616,Startup gets funding to build a ‘Stripe’ for visual recognition AI,"  Gaze , an AI startup operating in Singapore and Bangladesh, announced today that it has raised US$830,000 in a seed round from US-based venture capital firm Anchorless Bangladesh and an existing angel investor.

 Founded in 2018, Gaze offers an application programming interface for visual recognition technologies such as face recognition, product recognition, and multilingual optical character recognition often used for documents. It aims to be the WordPress or Stripe for visual recognition technologies. 
 “ Our goal is to get any developer to ‘Hello World’ in under five minutes,” Taus Noor, co-founder and CEO of Gaze, said.   
  How is it different?  The visual recognition market already has some promising players such as Singapore’s ViSenze, which is backed by Gobi Partners and Rakuten, and China’s SenseTime, whose investors include SoftBank, Singtel, and Alibaba, among others. 
 But Gaze said it’s focused on developing an ecosystem of open-source software suites built with its API. According to Noor, the startup has already started reaching out to open-source developers and communities to get them involved. Trying out the API is free of charge for developers. 
 “We believe our competitors are too focused on B2B sales, ignoring the end-user of the product, who are the developers,” Noor told  Tech in Asia . “At the end of the day, open-source communities play the biggest role in defining which technologies really take off at scale (especially for APIs).” 
 Since launching, Gaze said it has worked with a city police department to help improve traffic management, a defense agency to help secure their headquarters 24/7, and large factories to track daily vehicle inflow and outflow. 
  What are its challenges?  For Noor, the real challenge in the industry is scaling the APIs and other solutions available to empower developers globally. “We also have to make sure that our product is extremely easy to use for anyone with or without any computer vision knowledge,” he added. 
 In the next few months, Gaze will roll out at least four open-source projects, including a toll monitoring system using automatic license plate recognition and a face recognition-enabled contactless attendance system. 
  What’s the opportunity?  The startup is looking to take on the face recognition market, which is worth around US$4 billion in 2020 and grows by 15% every year. To do so, it’s currently forming different pricing schemes, including a pay-as-you-go model – priced at US$0.002 per call for its current customers – and a freemium subscription. 
  How much traction has it gotten?  Some of Gaze’s paid customers include the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, Bangladeshi conglomerate Meghna Group of Industries, and Bangladeshi fintech firm Nagad, among others. It’s also developing partnerships in India and Myanmar for identity verification using its APIs, the company said. 
  Who are the team members?  Gaze currently has a team of 23 people across Canada, Singapore, and Bangladesh. 
 Noor, who previously worked at Nvidia and IBM, established the startup with Motasim Rahman who was a former product chief at Vancouver-based Fireout. He was also the brains behind NogorBalok, a social networking platform in Bangladesh. 
 Meanwhile, Gaze’s chief technology officer, Kevin Pierce, led the engineering team at Vancouver-based ticketing startup Picatic, which was later acquired by Eventbrite. Nabeel Mohammed, the startup’s research chief, is an academic that specializes in machine learning and holds a doctorate in computer vision.

649686,Jio Platforms raises nearly $14b in 2 months," Jio Platforms, the digital services arm of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries, has now raised a total of US$13.7 billion across 10 deals in a little less than two months. 
   
 In April, social media giant Facebook invested  US$5.7 billion  in exchange for a nearly 10% stake in the company. With the deal, Facebook wants to enable new opportunities for India’s 60 million small businesses, starting with its messaging app WhatsApp. 
 It’s also said that the two companies were in talks to create a  WeChat-like super app  that will combine features like social, digital payments, gaming, and flight and hotel bookings, among others. 
  See:  Why is Facebook betting $5.7b on Reliance?   
 In May, Jio welcomed four investments from US-based firms Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, and KKR, which committed  US$747 million ,  US$1.5 billion ,  US$870 million,  and  US$1.5 billion , respectively. Later in June, Silver Lake poured an additional US$600 million, raising its stake in Jio to 2.1%. 
 The Indian company also attracted investments from Abu Dhabi: Sovereign investment firm Mubadala is set to invest  US$1.2 billion  for a 1.9% stake and a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority committed  US$752 million . 
 And just this week, Jio welcomed its newest investors L Catterton and TPG Capital, which will inject  US$250 million and US$600 million , respectively. 
 Jio has an ambitious goal of helping India’s 1.3 billion people go digital. In the last five years, majority of the population began to benefit from having affordable smartphones and cheap internet data, according to a report. India is now the  second-largest online market  behind China with over 560 million internet users. 
 But Jio, which runs the largest telco in the country, is facing competition. Airtel, one of the biggest players in the industry, was reportedly in talks to get at least  US$2 billion  from US ecommerce giant Amazon.

 At a recent webinar hosting C-suite executives and IT professionals across various industries,  Huawei  announced the launch of its OptiX network solutions for enterprise campuses and data centers in Asia Pacific. 
 The solution consists mainly of two parts: Campus OptiX and DC OptiX. While the former enables enterprises to deploy campus network connections, the latter allows businesses to build their own “data center interconnect” (DCI) networks. 
 The launch is part of the Shenzhen-based company’s plan to help enterprises in the region cope with the opportunities and challenges brought by new technologies and applications, and pave the way for digital transformation. 
 As enterprise digital transformation efforts accelerate, “the traditional network architecture needs to be reshaped,” Jason He, vice president of Huawei’s enterprise business group, said during the event. 
 “[In] leveraging Huawei’s R&amp;D innovation capabilities and leadership in the optical industry, we are confident that our star products, Campus OptiX and DC OptiX solutions, will help enterprises in the Asia-Pacific region sharpen their digital competitive edge through an all-optical network foundation,” he said. 
 Withstanding surges in online traffic 
 Due to the rapid development of emerging technologies and the growing adoption of smartphones, data centers are increasingly having to deal with massive amounts of online traffic. With Covid-19 forcing the working population of entire countries to work from home, data centers face an even greater challenge. 
 “We have seen a surge of over 50% in online traffic under the current climate. It’s critical for enterprises to strengthen their data center infrastructure to provide a consistent digital experience to their customers with reliable network connectivity,” Aaron Wang, managing director of Huawei’s enterprise business group in Singapore, said at a separate launch event. 
 It’s especially important for businesses that deal with sensitive data. If a data center goes down, its security can be compromised. Indeed, keeping data center infrastructure strong goes a long way in ensuring that the data these firms store remains secure.

 At a panel during the webinar, Songchai Phochai, a senior system engineering manager at Thailand’s  National Interbank Transaction Management and Exchange (ITMX) , echoed this sentiment. As a financial service provider, it’s crucial for ITMX to guarantee the absolute safety and reliability of customer information. 
 “Security and reliability are on top of the agenda when building network infrastructure,” Phochai said. These concerns, he added, were the reasons ITMX chose to build its DCI network with the help of Huawei’s DC OptiX solutions, which leverage AI to predict gradual failures in a network. 
 As of the end of 2019, the company’s solutions have helped build campus networks in over 600 universities, properties, hotels, and resorts in over 40 countries. It also built DCI networks for more than 120 businesses,  including Chinese internet giant Baidu .

649744,Grab to let go of 360 employees," Ride-hailing giant  Grab  will be letting go of about 360 people, or under 5% of its staff, CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan announced earlier today in a letter to employees. 
 “Over the past few months, we reviewed all costs, cut back on discretionary spending, and implemented pay cuts for senior management,” Tan wrote. “In spite of all this, we recognize that we still have to become leaner as an organization in order to tackle the challenges of the post-pandemic economy.”

 Tan noted that Grab will need to prepare for “a long recovery period” as it expects the Covid-19 pandemic to result in a prolonged recession. 
 Aside from the job cuts, Grab will be sunsetting some non-core projects and consolidating functions. 
 It’s also doubling down on its delivery verticals to meet the increased demand. Earlier this month, the company said it has expanded its daily essentials and grocery delivery service  GrabMart  into eight countries across the region. It will also focus on adapting its core verticals such as ride-hailing, payments, and financial services to the new normal. 
 In his letter, Tan emphasized that today’s job cuts would be the last organization-wide layoff this year. “I am confident as we execute against our refreshed plans to meet our targets, we will not have to go through this painful exercise again in the foreseeable future,” he said. 
 Affected employees will get severance payment, enhanced separation pay, a waiver of annual cliffs for equity vesting, medical insurance coverage, maternity and paternity leave, encashment of unused accrued annual leave and GrabFlex credits, and emotional and career transition support. 
 Earlier this year, Grab’s archrival Gojek  denied reports of layoffs  at the company’s internal townhall and claimed that its transportation business has been profitable for “a few months.” ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.999508)]","['GrabMart', 'Grab', 'Gojek']",[]

 The US$110 million Beenext Emerging Asia Fund will focus on investing in early-stage startups in India and Southeast Asia to accelerate digital technologies across the region. It will target sectors like ecommerce, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edtech, AI, and other data-driven tech. 
 According to a statement, about half of the fund’s amount will be used for Indian startups. 
 Institutional investors in the US, Japanese corporations, global family offices, and entrepreneurs are among the investors for the new fund, Beenext said. These investors will also serve as partners for its portfolio companies. 
 Meanwhile, the other US$50 million fund will be used for software-as-a-service businesses in Japan. 
 With Covid-19 in the foreground, Beenext believes that digitization will help drive the economy post-pandemic. “Covid-19 has impacted every aspect of global business, but we continue to see startup founders pushing the boundaries to not only survive but thrive in this environment,” said Teruhide Sato, founder and managing partner at Beenext. 
 Since its inception in 2015, the company has invested in more than 180 startups globally, including 72 companies in India such as real estate search portal NoBroker, payments app Citrus Pay, and mobile esports platform Mobile Premier League. It also has 45 investments in Southeast Asia and Japan such as ecommerce platform Zilingo, edtech startup Zenius, and HR SaaS company SmartHR. 
 Some of its latest investments include an  US$8.6 million  round for Indonesian peer-to-peer lender Akseleran and a  US$1 million  seed round for Singapore-based software development company Credify.

649352,4 major deals propelled Asian fundraising in May,"    
     
 ||item|| 
  This article is part of a  series of monthly reports  where we keep track of Asian tech funding activity.  
 Last month,  Reliance Jio  and  MGI Technology  were the top-funded companies in Asia, where more than 300 deals totaling over US$11 billion were made. 
 In May, Shenzhen-based gene sequencing equipment manufacturer MGI Technology raised US$1 billion in a series B funding round led by IDG Capital and China’s asset manager CPE. 
 The company, founded in 2016, focuses on research and development, production, and sales of DNA sequencing instruments, reagents, and related products to support life science research, agriculture, precision medicine, and healthcare segments. It is a subsidiary of Shenzhen’s BGI Group, China’s largest sequencing services provider. 
 MGI currently has more than 1,000 employees and operates in 39 countries. The latest investment comes one year after it raised US$200 million in its first funding round. 
 In the region, over half of the total amount of fundraising this month went to China, followed by India (19%), Japan (10%), and Singapore (6%). 
 Reliance Jio, the digital services arm of India’s Reliance Industries, raised around US$4.6 billion from General Atlantic, KKR, Silver Lake, and Vista Equity Partners in several funding rounds. Meanwhile, in Singapore, ecommerce logistics company Ninja Van closed  US$279 million  in series D money from European logistics major GeoPost.

649702,"A founder is shutting down his startup, and he’d like to hear from you"," Dear readers, 
 When I was about to graduate years ago, I remember worrying if I’ll find a job in journalism. It was 2011: The world was just climbing out of a great recession and the economy was sluggish. 
 Journalism vacancies in Singapore were rare then, and the two media powerhouses, Singapore Press Holdings and Mediacorp, weren’t even hiring. I was fortunate that things eventually turned out well for me. 
 We’re now in another uncertain period. Jobs have evaporated and startups are shutting down left and right. 
 People who have been laid off understandably worry about feeding their families. But founders have their own struggles, too. A number of them have had to make an unpalatable choice between keeping their employees or saving their company. Many startups also lack the cash to provide sufficient retrenchment benefits. 
 As journalists, we at  Tech in Asia  have been reaching out to founders as we pursue stories about the challenges that their startups have been facing. 
 It’s admittedly not the best time for them to hear from us: Founders already have a lot of sh*t to deal with, and we’re adding to that pile. 
 So we’re grateful whenever they opt to be transparent about what went wrong in their company. Tom Lokenvitz, co-founder of Singapore-based Smove, is one of them.

 My colleague Joseph Gan wrote a piece last week that examines how  the car-sharing startup endured layoffs and a stalled Uber partnership, but not Covid-19 . 
 After we had published it, Tom  wrote this heartfelt note on Facebook : 
  
  Closing down a business that you have built over the past 9 years sucks. It’s a humbling experience, but I’m grateful that I was able to go on this journey and thankful to all the people that made it happen.
  
 He added: 
 
 
  Please PM me if you need some help, have specific questions, or just want to talk to someone who has been in your shoes. I understand there is a lot of silent suffering, so don’t worry, I made tons of stupid mistakes and will not judge you on any “mistakes” that you’ve made. 
   I also want to show that a healthy start-up ecosystem draws the right conclusions from “failure” and actually taps into the vast experience that even “failed” entrepreneurs have collected.
 
 
 So whether you’re a founder or an employee who’s been affected by Covid-19, do reach out and talk to someone. I’m sure things will be all right in the end. 
 Here are more stories we published last week:

649638,Singapore digibank Tonik raises $21m to launch in the Philippines this year," Singapore-based digibank  Tonik  said it has raised US$21 million in series A funding to bankroll the launch of its digital bank in the Philippines. It aims to start commercial operations in the country in the third quarter of 2020. 
 
  Tonik founder and CEO Greg Krasnov / Photo credit: Tonik 
 
 The round was led by Sequoia India and Point72 Ventures and included “significant” participation from previous backers Insignia Ventures Partners and Credence Partners, according to a statement. Insignia and Credence poured  US$6 million  into Tonik in February. 
 Founded in 2018, the digital bank provides deposit, loan, payment, and card products. It was recently granted its own bank license by the central bank of the Philippines (BSP) earlier this year to offer its services in the country, where it’s targeting a young and tech-savvy population. 
 “In the Philippines, where over 70% of the population remains unbanked, we are observing a rapid jump in consumer demand for digital banking and digital transfers since the start of the year,” Tonik CEO and founder Greg Krasnov said in a statement. 
 The startup estimates that the Philippines represents a US$140 billion retail savings market and a US$100 billion unsecured consumer lending opportunity. Krasnov told  Tech in Asia  that over the next five years, Tonik aims to have a user base somewhere in the millions. 
 “Our market entry will include a combination of organic marketing and partnerships,” he said, noting that the core of its strategy lies on the company’s unique product and its ability to reduce the major pain points presented by current competing solutions. 
 Some players already offering digibank services in the Philippines include Netherlands-based ING Bank, Malaysia’s CIMB Bank, and local player UnionBank. 
  See also:  As traditional banking slows, Thai banks future-proof by capitalizing on fintech   
 Krasnov said the company initially planned to launch the digital bank this month, but moved it to around September and October in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 “Managing a workforce spread across eight countries has also been a unique challenge. However, we have adapted well […] so we are confident of being able to achieve our revised launch timeline and bring our solution to market by the end of the year,” the CEO said.

649457,Hmlet invests in property listing tech amid its asset-light shift," Singapore-based co-living firm  Hmlet  is ramping up its investments in technology aimed at digitizing the property lending market.

 The Sequoia-backed startup has developed a property and lifestyle platform that helps landlords better run their businesses. Called Hmster, the platform allows landlords to list their properties online, giving them greater access to insights about their properties and their customers. 
 It keeps track of occupants’ move-in and move-out dates, makes a list of additional services they avail, and serves as an invoice management tool. The proprietary software also gives property owners access to advisory services on design and furnishings for rooms and buildings. 
 On the lifestyle side, Hmlet has also developed a mobile app that allows tenants to not only easily keep track of their rent but also book tickets for certain events. It is only available for those living in Hmlet-powered properties, the firm’s new chief technology officer Pramodh Rai told  Tech in Asia.  
 The development follows Hmlet’s recent switch to an asset-light model. Previously, the startup directly leased properties from landlords and real estate firms, then renovated them to maximize living spaces. 
 With the shift, Hmlet has made two key promotions in its executive team on Monday, including Rai. 
 Prior to his new role as CTO, Rai served as Hmlet’s senior vice president for product and technology. He joined the company last year after serving as chief product officer for Singapore-based peer-to-peer lender Funding Societies. 
 Hmlet also promoted Rajive Keshup to serve as its chief financial officer. Keshup was previously the company’s senior vice president for finance, investment, and strategy and held the same role at cloud-based business management software firm Deskera. 
 “We’ve managed to navigate Covid-19 pretty efficiently so far, driving a material improvement in our unit economics and proving resilience in our operating model,” Keshup said, adding that Hmlet currently has no plans on raising a traditional series C this year. 
 The company’s most recent fundraise was in July last year, raking in  US$40 million  in a series B round led by Burda Principal Investments. In 2018, it secured US$6.5 million in a series A round after bagging US$1.5 million in seed funding a year prior. 
 A source close to the company told  Tech in Asia  that Hmlet is currently fetching a valuation of US$300 million to US$350 million. 
 “We are focusing on innovative ways to transform the real estate ecosystem by being user-centric in adding value to our community of members, landlords, and partners,” said Rai in a statement. Hmlet is currently in the process of onboarding landlords onto its platform, the exec added. 
 This shift in focus, however, has come at a cost. One of Hmlet’s co-founders, Zenos Schmickrath, recently announced his  exit from the startup  amid the ongoing overhaul. Hmlet’s CEO Yoan Kamalski also previously said that the company had retrenched roughly 10% of its staff as their roles had become redundant. 
  See:  Co-living operator Hmlet sees big changes with layoffs and a pivot   
 A source familiar with the company told  Tech in Asia  that the layoffs had started in December 2019. Around that time, the company had 198 employees, its chief exec said. 
 With the pivot, Rai said that the company has decided to double down on its tech function, having bolstered its product management, engineering, data, quality assurance, and mobile development teams.

649646,One Championship’s layoff letter from CEO Chatri Sityodtong,"  One Championship’s  CEO and founder Chatri Sityodtong has sent a letter to employees addressing the layoffs, which  affected 20%  of the company.  Tech in Asia  obtained a copy of the letter through an anonymous source. 
 In the letter dated June 15, Sityodtong says the layoffs were to “future-proof” the firm and to sharpen its “core strategic priorities.” Retrenchments are still underway, with affected staff being notified via telephone to “treat everyone with dignity and compassion.” 
 The retrenchment package includes a one-month notice pay and an additional one-month pay for “every year of service,” prorated on a quarterly basis. One Championship will also pay for repatriation flights for employees and their families. They’ll get to keep their laptops and receive healthcare coverage until the end of 2020. 
 The company has also hired an HR consultancy firm to help affected staff with job opportunities, interview skills, and CV management. 
 Stock option holders will receive a 12-month extension to exercise their vested stock options. 
  Tech in Asia  has reached out to the company for further clarification on the layoff and its latest US$70 million fundraise that was announced earlier today. Stay tuned for further updates. 
 Here’s Sityodtong’s letter in full: 
 
 Dear Team ONE 
 It is with a heavy heart that I write this letter. The world is suffering from the single worst economic crisis in a hundred years due to Covid-19. After weeks of consultation with both our leadership team and our board of directors, I have made the decision to future-proof ONE Championship by both streamlining operations and sharpening core strategic priorities. 
 It is one of the most heart-wrenching decisions I have ever had to make in life. On the one hand, ONE has a strong balance sheet with a 9-digit war chest after today’s new funding announcement. It puts us in the perfect position to continue aggressively building Asia’s largest global sports media property. On the other hand, these extraordinary times for the world require unusual prudence to protect our company and to ensure its longevity for many years to come. With the decision to sharpen our focus around core strategic priorities, ONE will undergo a 20% reduction in total worldwide headcount. 
 I am truly sorry to our teammates who will be leaving us today. You are all superstars. Please know that I appreciate everything you have given to our dream. This workforce reduction is a reflection of the global macroeconomic environment and the need to sharpen core priorities. It is not a reflection of your work, your skills, or your passion. I know that all of you will go on to do extraordinary things in life. Your legacy will live forever in everything we do.  Without a doubt, ONE Championship would not be where it is today without your blood, sweat, and tears. I wish you continued success and happiness for your next adventure. Thank you for everything from the bottom of my heart.  
 In the spirit of gratitude, we did our best to smoothen the transition for you. For those of you leaving today: 
 
 You will receive standard one-month notice pay. 
 You will also receive one-month pay for every year of service, prorated on a quarterly basis. 
 For example, if you worked for ONE for five years in Singapore, you will receive six months pay. 
 For stock option holders, you will receive a 12-month extension to exercise your vested stock options. 
 Your healthcare coverage will continue until the end of the year. 
 We have hired a top HR consultancy (Hudson HR) to help you with job opportunities, interview skills, and CV management. 
 ONE will pay for flights back to your home country for you and your family. 
 You are permitted to keep your laptop permanently for your job search and beyond. 
 Your leaders will help with job referrals through our individual networks. 
 Your leaders will provide references upon request. 
 For Singapore-based employees, your gym membership will continue until the end of the year. 
 
 Immediately after our company meeting, our leaders will start one-on-one virtual video meetings throughout the day with every person impacted by this workforce reduction. We had hoped to do everything in person and face to face, but the current lockdown in Singapore has made it impossible to do so. With all of us stuck in our respective homes, we will do our best to treat everyone with dignity and compassion. Please note that, if you do not receive a call by 7 pm Singapore Time today, you will not be part of this workforce reduction. 
 While this is a sad day for all of us, I want to assure everyone that the  fundamentals of our company remain unchanged. Like other global sports media properties such as the NBA or the EPL, ONE is an IP-heavy, asset-light global platform business. As Asia’s only billion-dollar sports media property at global scale, ONE has a rare and dominant position in our industry. Our institutional investors understand these qualities deeply and continue to show unwavering support as witnessed by today’s capital raise announcement.  
 For me, today is one of the saddest days since I started ONE Championship. To everyone who has ever been a part of the ONE Championship story, please accept my most heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for everything. Tears, laughter, dreams, and love forged our magical memories together. No one can deny us of our greatness. No one can deny us of everything we have achieved together. No one can deny us of the hope, strength, dreams, and inspiration we have given to the world. 
 We are ONE. We will always be ONE. ",Joseph Gan,0,4,"[(0, 0.27601764), (1, 0.33747512), (3, 0.38645422)]","['EPL', 'ONE', 'CV', 'NBA']","['Asia', 'Sityodtong', 'Singapore']"
649494,Can online food delivery ever be profitable?," For many of the world’s biggest online food delivery platforms, being profitable in a thin-margin space remains elusive. But China’s Meituan-Dianping seems to prove that it’s entirely possible. 
 After weathering some rough waters after its initial public offering, Meituan-Dianping recorded close to US$400 million in net profits for 2019, with more than half of the company’s revenue coming from food delivery. Meanwhile, its US counterparts Uber and GrubHub are still striving for profitability.

 But the Chinese company’s success raises this question: Can others replicate its success in markets other than China? Meituan-Dianping benefits from some advantages, such as the country’s densely packed megacities, highly developed infrastructure, and even relatively lax parking regulations. 
 These same factors can also be found in Southeast Asia. That said, the region’s food delivery space is in its early stages and remains unprofitable – a new   Reuters  report  says that GrabFood’s Thailand business is still making a loss. 
 Densely populated megacities 
 On the whole, food delivery is typically an efficiency game. Margins are thin, and the traditional path to profitability lies in attaining high volumes while keeping costs down. 
 Therefore, the denser and more populous a city is, the more efficient it is for food delivery platforms. A delivery rider can fulfill more orders in a shorter span of time if they’re covering a smaller area. 
 “The market size at a country level is not important; the market size across top cities is what matters,” says Sangeet Paul Choudary, founder of  Platformation Labs  and author of the book  Platform Revolution . “Delivery economics are impacted by route optimization. Density and parking [regulations] are the biggest factors there.” 
 Chinese cities are generally much more densely populated than American ones. As  Bloomberg  points out, China’s urban areas have 2,426 people per square kilometer, almost eight times the comparable density. The US has 10 cities with a population of over 1 million, but China has over 100. For example, Liuzhou, China’s 50th largest city, has 2.1 million people. 
    
     
 Cities in India and Southeast Asia also tend to be densely populated megacities, which should give them a similar demographic advantage. Metro Manila in the Philippines has a population density of 21,000 people per square kilometer, while Indonesia’s Jakarta has 14,464 people per square kilometer. The latter does not even include the surrounding areas that make up Jakarta’s metropolis, which is home to an additional 20 million people who mostly spend their days within the city limits. 
 Of course, some of the biggest American cities like New York City or Chicago have comparable population densities. But ultimately, the US doesn’t have as many as China or Southeast Asia do. 
 Efficiency can go beyond demographics, however. It matters where a city’s restaurants are located, according to Jianggan Li, founder of venture builder Momentum Works and a former managing director of Foodpanda in Singapore. Delivery is always more efficient with streetside establishments because couriers can leave their bikes directly out front. In comparison, restaurants inside shopping malls require couriers to park in a designated area first before they can make their way into the building.

 “At Foodpanda, we saw that deliveries were very efficient in Barcelona,” he says. “Most restaurants front the street, and so do most apartments. A courier can just park in front and, at worst, run up a couple of stories without needing to go through security or present IDs.” 
 This ties in with another factor Choudary has pointed out, which is relatively lax parking regulations. 
 “In the US, you can’t exactly ride a scooter, leave it on the sidewalk, and run upstairs into an apartment. There are parking regulations, parking tickets to [pay for],” says Jeffrey Towson, a professor of investment at Peking University. “This is not the case in China and other Asian markets.” 
 There’s also the matter of labor. It is most expensive in the US, while Asian countries such as China and Indonesia have significantly lower labor costs and a ready supply of delivery workers from lower-tier cities. 
    
     
 Singapore is one Asian country where labor is relatively more expensive despite a lack of across-the-board minimum wage regulations. That said, Li says labor is not as readily available in the city-state, leading to a reliance on foreign sources, which means complying with government quotas. 
 “It’s a chicken-or-egg problem,” he says. “You need large density and order volume to be efficient, but on the other hand, you will [also] need a lot of investment to get there.” 
 Low “multihoming” costs 
 There are even more factors at play, such as Meituan-Dianping’s ability to make money from advertising. Restaurants can pay Meituan-Dianping for a more favorable positioning in the app and in other marketing initiatives, which gives the platform more revenue at no additional cost. These, in turn, can be used as customer subsidies. 
 After Meituan acquired the food review app Dianping in 2015, its user base broadened to include dine-in consumers, which has led to more efficient user acquisition for deliveries. Momentum Works’ Li points out that this development encouraged the merged company to go into bike-sharing and powerbank rentals, which allow them to gain and retain customers at cheaper costs. 
 This strategy, however, would have different ramifications for the US and for Southeast Asia. In the US, advertising is mature enough that restaurants can promote themselves through Google and Facebook. China’s advertising networks, on the other hand, do not have the same maturity,  wrote  Sheji Ho, a former chief marketing officer at the ecommerce enabler aCommerce. Hence, platforms have turned to the super-app model as a way to build customer acquisition channels. 
 Ho points out in his article that unlike in the US, Facebook and Google don’t have a strong hold on Southeast Asia’s local advertising market yet. This means adopting China’s super-app model could work in the region, though some say the delivery volume is still not big enough for restaurants to see the value of advertising.

 In 2019, Meituan-Dianping recorded 15.8 billion yuan (or US$2.2 billion) from online marketing services. Its total user base equaled 6.2 million active merchants and 450.5 million transacting users. 
 For comparison, Gojek’s GoFood  announced  that for 2019, it had 20 million users ordering from 500,000 merchants. 
 Yet even at Meituan-Dianping’s scale, most of its revenue still comes from commissions. In 2019, commissions, including those from food delivery and other services, made up 67.2% of total revenue while online marketing made up 16.2%. 
 The same goes for Delivery Hero, the Berlin-based parent company of Foodpanda and a host of other brands. Present in over 40 countries, Delivery Hero claims to be the largest food delivery company outside of China, but its volume is still much smaller than Meituan-Dianping’s. The German company announced that it passed the 500,000-restaurant milestone in January 2020. 
 For 2019, Delivery Hero recorded 75.3 million euros (US$85.4 million) in revenue from “prime placings” – what it calls its online marketing service – which made up just 5.1% of revenue. On the other hand, commissions and delivery fees made up 86.9%. 
    
     
 Another advantage that Meituan-Dianping has is its commanding market share, which helps it overcome what Choudary says is a big issue in food delivery: low “multihoming” costs. 
 “It’s very easy for users to use multiple platforms and switch whenever it suits them,” he explains. 
 China has two main food delivery players: Meituan-Dianping, which has about 65% of market share, and Alibaba’s Eleme. Conversely, the current US leader GrubHub does not have majority market share and has to contend with more than one competitor. 
 Things are more fragmented in Southeast Asia, where the competition varies from country to country. GrabFood, which is present in eight markets, is the player with the widest regional presence. Foodpanda operates in five, while GoFood is only in three markets, although one of them – Indonesia – is the region’s largest. 
 But ultimately, neither the US nor Southeast Asia can compare to China in terms of scale, which has helped its food delivery platforms drive down prices. The size of China’s online food delivery market is estimated to be worth US$51.5 billion in 2020, according to Statista estimates – almost twice as high as the US’ and almost 15x compared to Southeast Asia’s in aggregate. 
    
     
 But in a sign of China’s more mature market, compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for 2020-2024 equals just 7%, whereas all of Southeast Asia’s markets have double-digit rates, according to Statista. China’s 410.8 million online food delivery users also represent 29.3% of its population. That’s higher than every Southeast Asian market, except for Singapore’s (42.1%). Malaysia has the second highest rate with 21%, while Indonesia has 14%. 
 There’s also the question of wealth distribution. China has multiple economic centers while much of the economic power in Southeast Asia is still concentrated in the capital cities. This can mean that in lower-tier cities, food delivery is more of a luxury. 
    
     
 A good omen for the super-app model 
 Fundamentally, food delivery platforms are locked in a tug of war between keeping prices down in order to earn a profit, and not overdoing it to the point of alienating restaurants. 
 Li thinks that Covid-19 aside, “platforms would prefer to keep the price as similar as possible to dine-in [prices] so that it remains competitive.” He adds, “If the price difference becomes too high, then people just go the old way.” 
 As for restaurants, Li explains that when delivery is not their main source of income, they have an incentive to raise prices on the app, especially because they don’t have to pay a commission for dine-in customers. The idea is to reduce the burden of commission while still attracting people to dine in. 
 With Covid-19, commissions can eat up the margins of restaurants because delivery has inevitably become their main source of revenue. 
 “If a platform has negotiation power, their option is to squeeze the restaurant – but not a lot, because it will still cause unhappiness among the restaurants,” Li says. 
 Meituan-Dianping, for example, takes different commission rates, depending on the restaurant. Bigger restaurants have more negotiating power.

 When taking into account the entire revenue pie, though, restaurants ultimately have the largest share. That’s because the biggest component of a delivery order will always be the food itself, and almost all of the proceeds go to the restaurant. This explains why platforms such as Deliveroo are going into cloud kitchens, Choudary says. 
 Cloud kitchens let platforms  improve margins  by renting spaces in less strategic locations while also leveraging data to determine which cuisines or dishes do well. And because the space is fully used for online deliveries, there is less incentive for restaurants to raise prices. 
 However, this is a nascent strategy that can still evolve. We’re already seeing platforms launching their own food brands – and keeping all of the income for themselves. 
 Restaurant chains have long offered in-house delivery. McDonald’s is an example, along with pizza places like Domino’s or Pizza Hut (which operates a delivery-only offshoot called PHD in Indonesia). These restaurants include delivery in their cost structure, and their delivery riders are not on-demand “freelancers.” 
 McDonald’s outlets are also located strategically. Its riders need to serve only one branch of one restaurant instead of multiple ones over the course of an hour, which lets the restaurant plot out the most efficient delivery path for each rider. 
 But McDonald’s did end up partnering with UberEats in several markets. One reason may be the trouble of overseeing their own delivery fleet in markets such as Singapore, where managing manpower in general is not easy, according to Li. 
 Labor in the city-state is not as available as in other markets, and the government sets regulations for foreign worker quotas. McDonald’s still offers its own delivery service in Singapore, however, while also being present in platforms like GrabFood. A restaurant business of McDonald’s scale would also have more negotiating leverage. 
 All in all, this bodes well for the super-app model espoused by Grab and Gojek in Southeast Asia, but with caveats. Peking University’s Towson says that Meituan-Dianping was shrewd in pairing a high-frequency, thin-margin service like food delivery with low-frequency yet higher-margin services like hotel bookings. Food delivery helps with the app’s stickiness, but it’s the other services that bring home the major cash. 
    
     
 This is apparent in Meituan-Dianping’s financial statements. While food delivery brought in 56.2% of the company’s 2019 revenues, it made up just 8.6% of gross profits. Meanwhile, its in-store, hotel, and travel segment brought in 61.1% of gross profits. 
 For Southeast Asian players, copying Meituan-Dianping by also going into travel may not be realistic. Traveloka, for example, is already a large operation, particularly in Indonesia – though Covid-19 has since led to much uncertainty in the industry. The answer, for now, appears to be fintech.

 Though the company kept the investors in the round undisclosed, One Championship group president Hua Fung Teh said it included participation from existing institutional investors as well as a new institutional investor. 
 Founded in 2011, the mixed martial arts major is one of the region’s largest sports media properties, broadcasting to over 2.7 billion potential viewers across more than 150 countries. 
 It most recently raised US$166 million in a series D round in late 2018 led by Sequoia Capital. Other investors in the round include Temasek and Greenoaks Capital. In 2017, One Championship banked US$100 million in a series C raise co-led by Sequoia India and Mission Holdings. 
 In addition to the funding, One Championship also said it has streamlined its operations, which included cutting its total worldwide headcount by 20%. According to its LinkedIn profile, the company has between 201 and 500 employees. 
 As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, One Championship announced in March that it would be suspending live events. It was planning to hold matches without fans in Singapore during April and May, but strict social distancing measures forced the company to cancel the events. 
 One Championship’s last event was held in Singapore on February 28. However, Teh remains positive about the company’s operations moving forward. 
 “With nine figures of cash on the balance sheet and a streamlined organization, One Championship looks forward to continuing to delight our fans around the world with more heroes and new experiences for many years to come,” he said. 
 On the other hand, its US-based peer Ultimate Fighting Championship has already returned to action last month.

649445,The importance of key metrics in building an enduring business," The most successful founders leverage data every day to get better at what they do. 
 They start with a vision, which they then break down into goals that are relevant for each phase of development.

 No matter how a business outlines its action plan, it’s best to identify the metric that would matter most in each phase, as well as a counter metric that will help ensure sustainable success. 
 For example, when scaling its business, a company’s key metric could be the number of active users and the counter metric would be customer acquisition costs (CAC). Then in the revenue phase, the focus may be on the average revenue per user, with the conversion rate as the counter metric. 
 Once identified, these key metrics should be the company’s North Star. 
 Translating a goal into a series of measurable steps helps ensure that everybody can do something to move the ball forward each day. And in reviewing data, accountability is assured through a constraint that’s measured with a counter metric. 
 Picking the right metric for your business goals 
 Founders typically ask themselves one of three questions to help define their North Star: 
 
 
 What is the company’s vision?  Consider Facebook: Their vision is to connect the world, and their key metric is monthly active users on the platform. For the last 15 years, this has remained their top priority. 
 
 What phase is the company in?  A startup’s business goals may change with each phase, which is also applicable to their key metric. A company that’s looking for product-market fit will want to focus on engagement and retention, while a company in the scale phase would likely pay attention to the number of users. Those in the stage of building an economic engine to monetize their startup will want to focus on unit economics. On the other hand, a growth-stage company that’s looking to build a sustainable business will focus on cash flow. 
 
 What’s the biggest risk to the business and how can it be mitigated?  This is an important question for any startup in a highly competitive industry or one where the failure rate is typically high. How can I quantitatively track progress against the key risk to my business? 
 
 The key metric will vary from startup to startup, depending on their phase and business priorities. 
   
 The founders of B2B payments company BharatPe, for example, focused obsessively on driving usage once it learned that it had product-market fit. The company’s key metric was the number of transactions as well as the total payment volume that was flowing through its system. 
 Shortly after launching, it was doing 50,000 transactions per month; that figure has since grown over 1,000x in the last 18 months. Much of BharatPe’s success can be attributed to its initial focus on that key metric and the drive to improve on it. 
 Meanwhile, other companies focus on a data point that can prove they can grow at scale, like this particular startup that Sequoia Capital had partnered with at the seed stage. With his company focusing on the blue-collar jobs space, the founder was confident it could scale the number of users, given the millions of people in his target demographic. However, when he looked at the competitive landscape, he realized that other companies in the space had lost momentum due to low user retention. 
 So he looked at his key metric through the lens of business risk instead: Can long-term engagement be driven in what has been a very transactional category with historically poor retention? 
 For both companies, the process of defining one key metric helped bring clarity, focus, and alignment across their teams while driving accountability at the same time. 
 Watch the counter metrics 
 What’s impressive about the rapid growth of BharatPe’s merchant base is that it scaled quickly without increasing CAC. 
 Its decision to try to limit CAC as a key counter metric affected many other decisions the company has made, including what channels to use for acquisition, what segments and geographies to focus on, how to onboard new merchants, when to accelerate growth, and when to slow down. 
 Having a clear counter metric can help founders make critical decisions on where and how to spend their money. This can be a lifesaver for a startup, especially in the current economic environment. All too often, founders take a “growth at all costs” approach once they’ve raised capital. A counter metric can help develop a more sustainable approach to building and growing the business. 
 This measure can also help keep everyone in the company on the same page and aligned with the company’s vision, as startups often drop the ball in this aspect. 
 Check out the data for this social-video startup. Keen to drive stronger engagement, the company picked the daily active user/monthly active user (DAU/MAU) ratio as their key metric. As the graphs below indicate, it was performing well on this measure. But oddly enough, the D1 retention rate, which tracks the percentage of new users that come back the next day, was falling sharply. 
   
 A probe into the matter revealed that the team charged with driving DAUs had been spamming users with eight to 10 notifications a day to drive engagement. While this strategy works in the short term – odds are someone will click on them – users quickly get tired of it and switch away from the platform. It’s an example of “low-quality” improvement that will not lead to sustainable growth. 
 This is why communication and alignment are so important. Founders should think about the biases in their organizations and make sure they’re not being led astray by some small gimmick. It’s surprising how often a company tries to implement measures that are intended to drive key performance indicators but ultimately erode the business. 
 At each phase of the startup journey, identify one key metric and one counter metric – and track both relentlessly. Track all the data possible to help optimize for those “mother” metrics.  Make sure everyone in the company is aligned to the same vision, the same goal – and following the same detailed road map. Plus, it creates a culture of honesty, whereas short-term hacks are often just that: short-term hacks. 
 If you can move the ball forward every day, and if you can articulate exactly how to measure that progress, you’ll set the foundations for building a long-term, enduring business.

649574,Thai proptech startup ZmyHome bags pre-series A money," Fraud is a common problem in property marketplaces, as over 90% of all listings are duplicated, fake, or outdated. Recognizing this problem,  ZmyHome  wants to create a “clean property platform” that lists only available properties and their actual prices, eliminating duplicate entries. 
 The Thailand-based company today announced that it has secured an undisclosed amount of pre-series A funding led by South Korean VC firm BonAngels Venture Partners. Existing investor KK Fund and some Thai angel investors also participated in the round. 
 The latest investment comes after the startup bagged  US$400,000  from KK Fund in 2018. ZmyHome said it has raised a total of US$1 million to date.

 Founded in 2016, ZmyHome helps sellers offer their properties directly to buyers in a neighborhood and claims that its platform allows users to sell their properties online within a month of listing. 
 The company also provides advisory services for location and project assessment, pricing evaluation, legal processes, and loans, among others. 
 The new funds will go toward improving the tool it uses to match buyers and sellers, acquiring more users, and establishing an agent service called YueYen. 
 YueYen, which means “happy living” in Thai, was soft launched in April. It consists of a network of 10,000 agents who facilitate property transactions in a certain neighborhood and uses technology to collect listings from owners and agents in the area and promotes them to home buyers. According to a statement, a service fee is charged when a transaction is completed, and all sellers – including agents – only pay a share of commission for every successful deal. 
 To date, ZmyHome has attracted 1.2 million visits per month, with over 25,000 listings sold or rented. 
 Despite the impact Covid-19 has wrought on the real estate market, the company said it still sees the opportunity for firms to use technology to remodel the traditional sector. As buyers spend more time online, ZmyHome claims to have served over 100 enquiries within a month, with traffic growing by 30% month over month since March. 
 Other proptech players in Thailand include  Hipflat  and  Horganice , which is backed by Beacon Venture Capital, the corporate VC arm of Kasikornbank. There’s also DDProperty, which was acquired by Singapore’s PropertyGuru in 2011. PropertyGuru itself said it grew its revenue by  24%  last year, but expects a slowdown in 2020 due to the pandemic.

 TPG will take a 0.93% equity stake in Jio while L Catterton’s investment will translate into a 0.39% stake on a fully diluted basis. 
 The two companies are the latest Jio investors, joining Facebook, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The digital services firm has now raised a total of US$13.7 billion since April. 
 With more than US$79 billion of assets under management, TPG’s portfolio companies include Airbnb, Uber, and Spotify, among others. 
 Meanwhile, LVMH-backed L Catterton focuses on investing in consumer-focused brands with around US$20 billion of equity capital across seven fund strategies. Its portfolio includes exercise equipment and media company Peloton, online used cars platform Vroom, fitness classes provider ClassPass, Japanese eyewear chain Owndays, and Indian store FabIndia, among others. 
 “I particularly look forward to gaining from L Catterton’s invaluable experience in creating consumer-centric businesses, because technology and consumer experience need to work together to propel India to achieving digital leadership,” Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, said. 
 Jio Platforms aims to enable a digital India for 1.3 billion people and businesses across the country, including small merchants, microbusinesses, and farmers. 
 According to a report, India is the  second-largest online market  behind China with over 560 million internet users, and it’s expected to reach 666 million by 2023.

 The Singapore-based fintech firm announced that it has raised US$11 million from its parent company, GBCI Ventures.

 The platform, which was rolled out last year, also allows users to build their own social networks in-app as well as make contactless mobile payments. 
 “Fincy can provide an affordable, contactless alternative to existing financial services, especially in a post-Covid world,” said Gan, who is also GBCI’s chief executive. 
 The blockchain-powered contactless payments approach is already present in Myanmar and Cambodia, where it’s serving more than 700 merchants and over 40 companies for payroll, said Fincy. Its app allows users to make purchases and perform transactions, receive salary, and manage their money without physical interaction. 
 With the latest capital injection, Fincy plans to build its presence in Singapore and accelerate its growth across Southeast Asia. It will also establish a base in the city-state’s central business district as well as expand its data center network across Asia, where it has around 500 employees. Around US$1 million of the funding will be used to add around 50 new hires to support the team in Singapore. 
 In addition to the latest investment from GBCI, Fincy said it will be finalizing an external funding round in the coming weeks. 
 Fincy is not the only player in the money app space. It’s up against some big rivals such as ubiquitous Chinese super app WeChat and Singapore-based fintech firm Nium, which just  raised a funding round from Visa and BRI Ventures , among others.

649261,Solving Asia’s cross-border logistics puzzle," The Covid-19 pandemic has turned out to be an unexpected contributor to the growth of ecommerce in Southeast Asia. With more people staying indoors amid imposed lockdowns,  downloads of shopping apps have increased in most markets across the region . 
 Ecommerce platforms now have an important part to play in helping people purchase essentials and do their shopping, and a key component to carry out this mission is logistics. 
 “Logistics plays a primary role in the customer’s perception of trust in an ecommerce platform,” says Ku Young Bae, the founder and CEO of  Qoo10 , one of Asia’s leading online marketplaces. “If an otherwise flawless platform uses a logistics partner that constantly falls short of expectations, it will not take long for customers to avoid using it.” 
 The current climate has brought this to the fore: Exponential increases in orders have led to  delivery backlogs and items going missing . These issues affect not only customers but also sellers, who often face criticism for poor delivery processes that they don’t even manage. 
 
   Ku Young Bae, founder and CEO of Qoo10 / Photo credit: Qoo10  
 
 The challenges of cross-border logistics 
 As online shopping platforms become more globalized in their selection of products and merchants, the importance of logistics processes has also increased. This is particularly true in Asia, where there are  varying levels of infrastructure development  and a lack of unified customs processes. That said, affordable tiers of international delivery services can take anywhere from two to eight weeks to fulfill an order, making the wait for overseas products inconvenient. 
 “Customers would usually turn back to retail options or not make their purchases at all, and the opportunities of having overseas merchants selling on the platform will be wasted,” says Ku. 
 As a result, people tend to pay a lot more for faster delivery services, and cross-border logistics players are trying to balance speed, efficiency, and cost to meet consumer standards. 
 There are a few hurdles in combining these factors, though. At the big-picture level, international logistics requires huge amounts of foundational infrastructure to run smoothly across geographical borders, which undoubtedly costs a pretty penny. 
 Closer to the ground, other issues have cropped up: Inaccurate item declarations on logistics paperwork, unsecure packaging that leaves products susceptible to damage, and varying customs rules per country regarding prohibited items. 
 Often, these issues can result in delivery delays or, in some cases, cause parcels to go undelivered entirely, says Wilson Wong, group leader at  Qxpress , the logistics subsidiary of Qoo10. 
 Lithium-based batteries and alcohol-based hand sanitizers, for instance, cannot be sent via air freight. 
 “If these are straightforward products, platforms like Qoo10 can always build logic into their purchase process to automatically prevent these kinds of sales overseas,” Wong says. However, if the prohibited items are undeclared components of larger parcels that are only discovered en route to a destination, it will fall on the logistics company to decide what to do, he adds. 
 Delivering satisfaction 
 Better synergy between ecommerce platforms and their logistics solutions providers would go a long way toward simplifying the fulfillment process and reducing potential points of failure. 
 For instance, Wong shares that by integrating Qxpress functions into the dashboards of Qoo10 sellers, logistical processes like waybill printing, tracking code updates, and shipping statuses can be seamlessly and automatically updated for the various parties involved. 
 Meanwhile, Qxpress’ last-mile delivery and selective warehousing capabilities adds another layer of convenience. By offering storage, inventory management, and fulfilment services for selected products, it minimizes certain risks for ecommerce firms. 
 The inventory management system, Wong says, intelligently orders a new batch of products based on the sales metrics from the previous batch, which makes the system more efficient overall. “It also allows for real-time updates of remaining product stocks,” he shares.

 Selective warehousing, Ku adds, also enables the platform to react quickly to customer orders. After all, Qxpress’ sorting facility and warehouse are situated in the same building, which saves a lot of time in the fulfilment process. 
 “Ultimately, this allows customers to receive their purchases the next day or even on the same day,” he says. 
 To facilitate even international deliveries, Qxpress generates automated customs clearance reports, integrates with ecommerce platforms through APIs, and offers real-time delivery tracking, inventory management, and fulfilment services. 
 The platform seems to be largely successful, delivering 97.5% of all international parcels within five working days, says Ku. Its prices, he claims, are up to 60% lower than similar services. 
 Making the speed and cost equation work 
 Logistics firms operate on the principle that delivery speeds can only go up with higher costs. But that needn’t be the case. High-speed delivery at lower price points is possible, and the catalyst lies in raising job volumes to achieve maximum cost efficiencies. 
 “Contrary to popular belief, increasing job volume does not mean more delivery delays,” says Wong. “Rather, it allows for better fleet scheduling and overall efficiency by closing the distance between each delivery.” 
 With ecommerce in the region  projected to continually trend upward  in the next few years, larger parcel volumes are in the cards. 
 Logistics companies, such as Qxpress, that are actively working on the speed-to-cost equation are well-positioned to ride this wave.

649339,A uniquely Chinese strategy is helping Zynn take on TikTok," In May, Chinese short-video company Kuaishou quietly launched Zynn, a new app that looks and functions like ByteDance-owned TikTok. 
 In less than a month, the app topped the charts in US app stores, surpassing TikTok thanks to an aggressive reward scheme that uses cash to draw in new users. While the customer acquisition tactic is uniquely Chinese, it’s now making its way to other markets as Chinese apps gain more ground overseas. 
 Easy cash 
 Kuaishou, China’s second-largest social-video app with  300 million  daily active users, has followed rival ByteDance’s footsteps to the US market with the dramatic launch of Zynn. 
 Developed by Kuaishou-owned 3D imaging company Owlii, the app and its release show that Chinese social media companies are prepared to spend big as they bring their rivalry to the West.

 There are three ways that users can earn rewards on Zynn: signing up, referring friends, and simply watching content. 
 The platform’s referral program, for instance, rewards US$20 to users who invite a friend to use the app, with an additional US$10 for every five friends they recruit thereafter. This means that if users can get 50 people to sign up, they receive a cash reward of up to US$1,100. 
 On top of that, the app has a reward system that gives out points to users for viewing content, which they can then exchange for cash or gift cards. With no limit to how much they can earn, some users have reportedly pocketed thousands of dollars from the app in just a few weeks. 
 While such systems are common in other apps, these tend to reward credits that can only be spent on the platform. China’s twist on this concept is that users get to cash out and spend the money however they like. 
 A slew of short-video platforms in China already employ similar user acquisition schemes. For example, Tencent’s short-video app Weishi offers up to 88 yuan (US$12) if a user watches videos for seven consecutive days, while Baidu’s short-video app Haokan also has a gamified cash reward system. 
 It can be cheaper to pay people to join the app than pay for media placements. 
 This approach is steeped in Chinese culture – giving friends and family members bright red envelopes stuffed with money is a tradition that often symbolizes good luck. In China, giving out virtual red packets is a common feature in mobile payments, food delivery, bike-sharing, and social media apps as well. 
 Tech behemoths like Tencent and Alibaba, for instance, have digitized and gamified this experience in apps like WeChat and Alipay. 
 Indeed, paying users has proven to be an effective tactic to make a splash in a new market like the US not only because “free” money is irresistible, but also because companies rewarding users with cash is a novelty. This undoubtedly helps Zynn stand out and proves that localization is not always the go-to strategy when it comes to international expansion. 
 “It may seem counterintuitive to pay people to use an app. However, user acquisition costs via paid media can be incredibly expensive,” Brendan Gahan, partner and chief social officer at San Francisco-based advertising agency Mekanism, tells  Tech in Asia . “It can be cheaper to pay people to join the app than pay for media placements.” 
 Take TikTok for example. In 2018, it  reportedly  burned around US$1 billion to run ads on popular sites like YouTube and Facebook. 
 Drawbacks 
 One of the criticisms of this tactic is that, in most cases, paying users for referrals and usage only works short term. 
 Apps in the first flush of growth like Zynn can effectively tap new users to recruit their circle of friends with financial incentives. But the system doesn’t address challenges like retaining its newly acquired users, creating usage habits, and generating buzz when the money tap turns off. 
 As the app reaches certain growth milestones, the rewards are likely to become less generous and more targeted, Jamie MacEwan, an analyst at UK research firm Enders Analysis, tells  Tech in Asia . “In the long term, the attractiveness of the product itself will need to do more of the heavy lifting in reducing churn and boosting engagement, while the cash rewards can be calibrated to effectively support this effort and bring in new users,” he says. 
 Case in point, Kwai, another short video app developed by Kuaishou, gained traction in a handful of markets a few years ago by employing  aggressive promotional strategies . But not long after, its momentum fizzled. 
 Taking a closer look at the strategy, there are also other caveats. With huge cash incentives, Zynn’s users may have joined the app with the intention of making easy money and not because they were interested in its premise, says Alessandro Bogliari, co-founder and CEO of marketing agency Influencer Marketing Factory. 
 In fact, users have  pointed out  that Zynn is a less sophisticated version of TikTok and that most of the videos uploaded to the platform are content that’s been ripped off from platforms like TikTok and Instagram and posted by pseudonymous accounts. 
 Zynn has been removed from Google Play Store since Tuesday over accusations of stealing content from other social platforms. The app is still live on Apple’s iOS app store.

 To succeed in the social media space, especially in the US, it generally comes down to cultivating and supporting the content creator community. Without creators to produce and share original content, the user experience would be ruined, Bogliari explains. 
 If Zynn wants to make further inroads in the US, it can’t rely heavily on its current cash-burning strategy. Technology capabilities like algorithms that know what viewers want to watch is also crucial. 
 “We believe quality and rich content is the key to user retention. Our algorithms can also help us take on this challenge,” a Kuaishou spokesperson tells  Tech in Asia . “We are currently working with a large group of creators to help us enrich the content on our platform.” 
 Cash outs, cashbacks, and subsidies 
 Rather than subsidies, cashback, rewards, and cash-out programs can be more attractive for users, as they are a more visible form of reward and are more likely to generate feelings of gratification. They’re also extremely flexible from a business point of view because they can be applied to any user action on any app, says MacEwan. 
 For instance, companies can tie rewards to specific growth and engagement targets while easily tweaking the level of investment, he explains. 
 Furthermore, cash and reward incentives coupled with gamification can help cultivate repeat behavior as users attempt to reach certain goals. 
 WeChat and Alipay are already doing this, giving out cash and rewards points to their mobile wallet users to boost usage. The two apps also ramp up efforts during holidays and festivals like the Chinese New Year, when they compete to roll out new schemes and games for users to earn virtual red packets worth hundreds of millions of dollars in total. 
    
     
 But aggressive cash-out schemes may still cause a company to bleed out. US-listed Chinese news aggregator Qutoutiao, which is backed by big investors like Tencent, uses a loyalty program to boost new sign-ups and encourage referrals on top of hefty spending on media placements. One of the platform’s top users reportedly received over 250,000 yuan (US$35,000) just by reading news and inviting friends to join. As a result of these measures, the company posted skyrocketing losses – US$386.3 million – in the fiscal year of 2019. 
 Lean and mean upstarts like  US-based news aggregator BuzzBreak  have seemingly found a way to employ cash-out tactics while remaining profitable. The company, founded by a former ByteDance employee, rewards users with small payouts of US$0.10 per click. And it can afford to do so thanks to its revenue-generating ads business and by keeping costs down. 
 On the other hand, ecommerce, ride-hailing, and delivery apps still commonly use subsidies as a way to attract users, which often take the form of discounts on products and services. This, however, can lead to significant losses on low-value orders, as delivery fees are effectively fixed costs. 
 Many ride-hailing companies like Uber depended heavily on passenger and driver subsidies for growth but were forced to scale back in order to curb losses. 
 The US is still a pay-to-win market. 
 While Uber never went so far as to hand out cash to users, it employed generous financial incentives and subsidies to drive up usage, ending up with a loss of over US$5 billion in the second quarter of 2019. 
 In the wake of Uber’s losses, Grab, which relied on large subsidies for growth, scaled back on its driver subsidies and food delivery promotion efforts. The ride-hailing firm then shifted to a point-based reward system where users can redeem vouchers and discounts for its services. 
 For new apps like Zynn, the US is still a pay-to-win market. Even dominant players like TikTok, which achieved its massive growth thanks to big spending in advertising and promotions, quietly started exploring rewards schemes last year. 
 With the support of Kuaishou and the backing of Tencent, there is nothing stopping Zynn from gaining a foothold in the Western short-video boom. But to compete in the increasingly crowded market, it needs to do more than splurge on cash-out programs.

649432,Gojek’s GoPlay is more like Spotify and Amazon Prime Video – not Netflix," It wasn’t too long ago when Indonesia had plenty of over-the-top (OTT) video providers. International streamers such as Netflix, Iflix, Hooq, and Viu as well as local players like Genflix and Vidio, which are subsidiaries of media conglomerates Mega Media and Emtek, respectively, crowded the scene. 
 But as time went on, some of them have struggled to stay in business. Singapore-based Hooq, backed by major telecommunications firm Singtel, recently  filed for liquidation , while Catcha Group’s Iflix has let go of staff and saw its co-founders depart as it  faced debt problems . 
 Amid this uncertainty, GoPlay, the video-streaming arm of homegrown unicorn Gojek, has scored a win. It has secured its  first external investment  in a round led by ZWC Partners and Golden Gate Ventures, with Openspace Ventures, Ideosource Entertainment, and Redbadge Pacific participating. An investor tells  Tech in Asia  that the funding is “in the ballpark of US$15 million.”

 Launched in September 2019, GoPlay believes its trump card is in being laser-focused on working with the Indonesian film industry to create content that locals want. And while people often liken it to Netflix, that isn’t the best comparison, people close to the company tell  Tech in Asia . 
 Instead of forking out huge sums of money upfront for content, which is how the entertainment industry and players like Netflix largely works, GoPlay is opting for an approach that it believes is more financially sustainable. 
 It’s using “a revenue-sharing model with content creators and production houses, for both GoPlay original movies and other local content, which helps filmmakers increase quality and benefits everyone in the ecosystem,” explains Edy Sulistyo, the company’s chief executive. 
 Hian Goh, co-founder and general partner at Openspace Ventures, echoes this view. Other players failed because they didn’t focus on providing quality original content for the Indonesian audience, says the investor, who built and eventually sold the Asian Food Channel in 2013. 
 Investors see parallels between China and Indonesia. “When iQiyi started in China [in 2010], the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and internet penetration were similar to Indonesia’s in 2019,” says Patrick Cheung, founder and managing partner of ZWC Partners. 
    
     
  Sources:  World Bank ,  PricewaterhouseCoopers , ZWC Partners’ research  
  * Forecasted based on ratio between China’s GDP per capita and entertainment and media spend per capita in 2019.  
 GoPlay was born from Gojek’s ambition to build a super app. Today, GoPlay users can pay the subscription fee via GoPay or buy a bundle package with discounts for other Gojek’s services, like GoFood and GoSend. 
 In this manner, GoPlay seems more similar to  Amazon Prime’s offering  in India rather than Netflix. 
 Gojek is trying to create a “complete ecosystem to get people’s money,” says Thomas Barker, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham’s Malaysia campus. “You order your transport, your food, and your entertainment.” GoPlay can certainly tap into its parent firm’s ecosystem to lower user acquisition costs, a luxury that Netflix or iQiyi didn’t have. 
 Taking a page from Spotify 
 To survive, GoPlay is avoiding the trap that has taken down Hooq and other similar platforms. By focusing exclusively on Indonesian content, GoPlay will likely stay in its home country for some time. 
 While GoPlay’s competitors are also commissioning Indonesian content, ZWC Partners’ Cheung isn’t worried. “How much resources will they be spending on Indonesia?” he asks. 
 Also, don’t expect GoPlay to splurge on content the way Netflix does. The US streaming giant is famous for its bullish approach: It spent US$15.3 billion on content acquisition in 2019 and is projected to spend  additional US$17.3 billion in 2020 . However, much of this activity is funded by debt.

 GoPlay prefers a more measured strategy, and it’s “pursuing a more new media approach to revenue-sharing like Spotify,” Openspace Ventures’ Goh says. Neither is it planning to hire expensive executives and consultants like Hooq did, he adds. 
 But revenue-sharing certainly has downsides. Spotify, for example, faces pressure from  influential music labels  that keep asking for larger and larger portions of the revenue. That’s why the music streamer is ramping up the production of original podcasts, far away from the territory of these industry heavyweights. 
 GoPlay, however, doesn’t need to contend with powerful music executives and act as a middleman. Instead, it’s working with local production houses and involved in the creative process. 
 In the past, GoPlay acquired licenses to adapt well-known foreign shows like South Korean crime serial  Tunnel  and US teen drama  Gossip Girl  for Indonesian audiences. The move enabled GoPlay to piggyback on the popularity of the original titles and reduce the time for script development, according to an executive from a competing company. This seems to have worked in GoPlay’s favor, as the localized version of  Gossip Girl  contributed to 25% of total views on the platform. 
 However, because GoPlay wants to invest in quality, each episode of that show costs 600 million rupiahs (US$43,000) on average to produce, the source says. Assuming that the production costs for its new family-focused series  Saiyo Sakato  is similar, then GoPlay has to shell out around US$1.5 million for those three programs. According to the executive, the licensing fee for an adaptation is “small” compared to production costs.

 GoPlay says that costs vary, depending on the production company as well as the genre and story requirements of the series. 
 According to Goh, US$43,000 per episode is an average budget for a well-made series that doesn’t include A-list actors or special effects. However, he also stressed that there’s no standard budget for content, and a high amount doesn’t guarantee quality. “I’ve seen people spend US$150,000 on terrible content, and US$20,000 on amazing content.” 
 On top of that, GoPlay also doesn’t have to shoulder 100% of expenses as it can co-produce content and split costs with other parties. 
 Ultimately, GoPlay’s approach is novel, but its sustainability remains to be proven. While ZWC’s Cheung cites iQiyi as a positive example, the publicly listed Chinese platform has yet to turn a profit despite also running revenue-sharing schemes with content producers. 
 According to its  financial statement , iQiyi been running at an operating loss since 2015 at least, and its cost of revenue – which covers bandwidth and content production costs – have consistently outstripped revenue.

 On the other hand, Netflix’s debt-fueled approach has been efficient. It has yielded  stronger bottom lines  and  fatter operating margins  year after year. Of course, despite this, Netflix’s cash-burning strategy isn’t practical for most companies to copy, unless they have the financial muscle of Disney or Apple. 
  Simplified P/L table for Netflix from 2015 to 2019  
    
     
  Source: Netflix’s financial report  
 It’s looking like GoPlay could be operating at a loss for a few years. But by leveraging Gojek, there’s a chance that it won’t have to burn as much as other players do to hit the same milestones. 
 Are customers responding? 
 GoPlay declined to share the number of its monthly active users but said that its registered users number in the hundred of thousands. Its users have grown 13x in recent months, though it’s unclear how much of it can be attributed to people staying at home during the Covid-19 pandemic or a 50% price drop in monthly fees last March, going from 89,000 rupiahs (US$6.40) to 45,000 rupiahs (US$3.20). 
 The main stumbling block for video-streaming companies in Southeast Asia is the lack of disposable income among users, according to consulting firm Fitch Solutions. The abundance of low-cost local competitors is another problem. 
  Comparison between OTT players in Indonesia  
    
     
 GoPlay’s rating in Google Play has been poor, with most of the complaints citing difficulties in logging in and app crashes. CEO Sulistyo says he is taking the feedback seriously, and the GoPlay team continues to improve the app. 
 Another hurdle for GoPlay is that Indonesians, like people in many other countries, seem to favor foreign movies over local ones – a preference that adds to Netflix’s appeal.

 Sulistyo is aware of this situation and says that it’s the local film industry and GoPlay’s “homework” GoPlay, to change the status quo. 
 China model 
 ZWC Partners’s Cheung admits that the most sought-after content in every country tend to be foreign ones. However, conditions will change once local platforms start producing high-quality content, he says. 
 In China, homegrown shows gained eyeballs when platforms like Youko got involved in the creative process, Cheung notes. “There are people who will still consume international content on Netflix, but the local market is still huge.” 
 He also believes that it’s more of a supply problem than a demand one. In Japan and South Korea, the ratio between local and foreign content is much higher compared to Indonesia.

 Cheung also points out that China’s entertainment scene has surged in popularity because it’s always trying new business models, like live broadcasting. 
 That said, while he’ll help Sulistyo by sharing lessons from China, ultimately it’s up to the GoPlay boss and team to figure out what works best in Indonesia. 
 In terms of content, Cheung thinks GoPlay may diversify further away from what can be typically found on Netflix. Live concerts could be a possibility, stemming from Sulistyo’s experience in that field, he predicts.

649438,"Hell yeah, enthusiasm matters"," Dear readers, 
 I joined  Tech in Asia  to run the sales team at our Studios arm, where we help brands connect to our network through sponsorships, content and events. Shortly after that, Willis, our CEO, and Maria, our COO, approached me and asked if I could take on a few new projects and a new group. While it worked out in the end, I have to admit that my immediate reaction fell short of expectations. 
 I hemmed and hawed at first, thinking out loud, “I mean… OK, I guess I can, but I’m not really sure how I’ll make time.” I was met with a surprised look that said, “I thought you’d be more into this.” 
 I learned an important lesson that day – one that I’ve learned before, but it clearly didn’t stick: Hell yeah, enthusiasm matters. 🔥 
 I thought about how this might be helpful in the context of other fast-moving startups. We often can’t control the pace of change around us, but we can control how we react to it.  If you try this, I promise it will supercharge your career. 
 There are simple ways to recalibrate your reaction to change. Saying “yes” doesn’t immediately solve every operational problem, and that’s OK. Those details are important, but you can address them after the moment has passed. 
 When presented with a new opportunity, instead of saying, “I don’t think I have time,” try: “That’s interesting! Let’s discuss how to prioritize this among my current projects.” 
 Instead of saying, “I don’t know how to do that,” try: “Can! But can you help me learn the right way to do this?” 
 Instead of saying, “That’s not the kind of project I want to be working on,” try: “I’m open to trying, but can you help me understand how this builds on the career goals that we’ve talked about?” 
 Some minor repositioning will work wonders for your career growth. It doesn’t mean you have to agree at once – you’re not a pushover – it just means you aren’t rejecting change out of hand.

649401,Vietnamese lending platform F88 secures $6m in new funding," Vietnamese financial services startup  F88  said it has closed its third growth investment round, raising roughly 140 billion dong (US$6 million) from Mekong Enterprise Fund III and Granite Oak. 
 The company secured the new funds at a valuation of 2.1 trillion dong (US$90.7 million) as of late 2019, according to a statement.

 Since its establishment in 2013, F88 has been focused on providing its customers with fast and easy vehicle title loans. The startup also provides other financial services, such as distributing life and non-life insurance, bills payment, mobile money, and e-wallet top-ups. 
 The new investment will allow F88 to continue expanding its network of branches as well as accelerate the growth of its existing locations, said its chairman and CEO Phung Anh Tuan. 
 F88’s branches serve as financial convenience hubs for its customers, providing easier access to its suite of financial services. The startup currently has 180 locations across 25 cities and provinces in Vietnam, growing from just 11 back in December 2016, according to Mekong Capital partner Chris Freund. 
 “Since our initial investment in 2018, F88’s performance has consistently surpassed our expectations with respect to growth, loan portfolio quality, and profitability,” said Simon Wagner, managing partner at Granite Oak. 
 As of last year, F88 claims to have successfully issued over 200 billion dong (over US$8.5 million) of corporate bonds, working with local investment banks and financial institutions. 
 The company was also granted the Client Protection Certificate by SmartCampaign, an international initiative that looks to ensure fair customer treatment in financial services, in September 2019.

 Launched in January this year, Ula offers products, a doorstep delivery service, and pay-later options for small retailers to help them store less inventory. The company – which was founded by former employees of Amazon, Flipkart, Lazada, P&amp;G, and Booking.com – also uses data science to give retailers working capital credit. 
 Currently in private beta mode, Ula only serves East Java but plans to expand across the island and across categories such as apparel and electronics over the next year, according to a statement. 
 Amid Covid-19, the company is focused on supplying daily needs such as fast-moving consumer goods and staples. With teams spread across Indonesia, India, and Singapore, it claims that the business has grown 10x since launching. 
 According to Ula, traditional retail contributes to nearly 80% of the retail market and employs millions of Indonesians. 
 “A typical store has an 8% to 10% cost advantage over modern retailers, given that they are usually tax exempt, employ their own family, and operate out of their homes,” said Ula co-founder Derry Sakti. 
 However, 70% to 80% of retailers in the archipelago aren’t competitive, as they are plagued by inefficiencies in supply chain, inventory, and working capital management, said Abheek Anand, managing director at Sequoia Capital India.

649130,Local services marketplace Zehitomo nets $7.5m in series B round," Launched in 2015,  Zehitomo  connects people who look for services with professionals such as photographers, yoga teachers, and consultants, among others. Last year, the Japan-based firm developed an AI feature that helps it select the right professionals that suit a client’s requirements, beefing up its recommendation system. 
 Now, the company has just raised US$7.5 million in a series B funding round led by DG Daiwa Ventures. 
 Venture capital firm Energy and Environment Investment, real estate developer Mitsubishi Estate, Persol Innovation Fund, AirTrip, as well as existing investors Coral Capital, SMBC Venture Capital, Mizuho Capital, and some individual investors also participated in the round.

 According to a statement, the company will use the new funds to hire talent as well as drive the supply side of local services online. 
 Jordan Fisher, CEO and co-founder of Zehitomo, said their service works differently from the traditional model where platforms take a margin in between transactions. “Our business model is lead generation, which means that the professionals pay to be introduced to client leads that they are interested in,” he explained. 
 The company claims that more than 200,000 businesses have registered on the platform to date and that more than US$100 million worth of job requests were generated via Zehitomo last year. 
 However, Fisher said that during Japan’s state of emergency, which the country declared in response to the Covid-19 threat, Zehitomo saw fluctuating demand, with the largest drop seen in events-related services such as photography and emceeing. Meanwhile, there was an increase in demand for online lessons, wellness practitioners, and certain home improvement services. 
 Demand has since recovered, Fisher said, vastly due to the country easing into normalcy. He noted, however, that Zehitomo is still a supply-constrained business. 
 “Consumers are searching online, but local service professionals like plumbers still use fax machines. So our challenge has been how fast we can bring the supply side online,” he said. 
 For the company, the pandemic – which has made getting new clients via offline means even more challenging for service providers – is an opportunity to help more professionals transition online. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.9996428)]",['AirTrip'],"['Japan', 'Zehitomo']"

 During the first quarter of 2020, Sea posted a total adjusted revenue of US$914 million, a 57.9% increase compared to the US$579 million it had recorded in the same period in 2019. 
 The growth was mainly driven by Garena, which grew its revenue by 30.3% year on year to US$512 million. Meanwhile, Shopee drew US$314 million in revenue, a 111% jump from the US$149 million it had reported a year prior. 
 Sea’s continued growth, coupled with strong investor interest shown by its climbing market cap, means that its business has been relatively safe from the effects of the global pandemic. 
 Covid-19 has been “materially accelerating a shift to online lifestyles that is broad, deep, and, in our view, irreversible,” Sea CEO Forrest Li noted during the company’s earnings call for the first quarter. 
 Li added that Sea will be able to profit from expanded growth opportunities as it continues to respond to increased consumer demand and react to potential business disruptions brought by the current crisis.

649302,500 Startups invests in pay-later startup Split,"  Split , a fintech startup that enables businesses to offer installment payment plans to their customers, said it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding in a round led by 500 Startups. 
 The funding was rounded off by global angel investors, including AccorHotels Asia Pacific deputy CEO Louise Daley. With her investment, Daley also joins the startup’s board of directors, according to a statement.

 Split provides businesses with a buy-now-pay-later solution that lets customers make up to three interest-free payments. The startup does this by paying businesses upfront, then managing the monthly payments from consumers. Companies are charged a transaction fee when customers opt to pay with Split, the statement said. 
 According to the startups’s CEO, Dylan Tan, the global pandemic has shifted consumer spending behaviors considerably, leaving many businesses struggling to adapt. 
 “Covid-19 has brought enormous economic uncertainty. This means consumers are more mindful of the money they spend, and businesses can’t keep offering unsustainable discounts,” he explained. 
 The fundraise comes as the startup continues to scale its platform across various industries, according to the statement. 
 Split, which operates in Singapore and Malaysia, was co-founded in 2018 by Tan and Vishvesh Suriyanarayanan as part of the talent investment program of global venture builder Entrepreneur First. 
 The startup started off by enabling installment payments in the travel industry, then it expanded to support transactions in the consumer goods and services spaces. 
 Now, Split supports major ecommerce platforms, in-store purchases, as well as social commerce apps and websites. Over 30 store partners have integrated its solution into their operations. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.99945456)]",['fintech'],"['Singapore', 'Malaysia']"

 Founded in 2015, Wallex is a business-to-business platform that focuses on providing small and medium-sized enterprises with foreign exchange and cross-border payment services. Its users can convert and pay in over 40 currencies, collect money via virtual accounts, and hold funds in a digital wallet. 
 Wallex plans to use the new capital to focus on building out its capabilities in specialized foreign exchange products and international collections, the company told  Tech in Asia . It also looks to scale its operations in Hong Kong, a new market for the startup, as well as in its existing markets of Singapore and Indonesia. 
 According to a statement, Wallex intends to grow its footprint across Asia, where 52% of global trade happens. With a team of over 75 employees, it claims to have achieved an annualized gross transaction value of US$1 billion. To further expand its business, the firm will continue hiring and developing partnerships as well. 
 Wallex’s series A round comes as businesses realize the importance of digital payments amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In Asia, the digital payments segment is seeing US$2.5 trillion in total transaction value this year, and it’s expected to reach  US$4.5 trillion  by 2024, according to Statista. 
 Prior to its latest funding, Wallex secured  pre-series A funding  from Beenext, Central Capital Ventura, and Indonusa Dwitama (an early investor in Tokopedia). ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(0, 0.1340298), (3, 0.86549366)]",['fintech'],"['Singapore', 'Asia', 'Tokopedia', 'Beenext', 'Indonesia']"
649276,"Smove endured layoffs and a stalled Uber partnership, but not Covid-19","  Every startup has earned its fair share of battle scars, and Singapore-based  Smove Systems  is no exception. Since it was established in 2011, the car-sharing startup had recovered from failed expansion plans and a round of retrenchments, survived a halted partnership with Uber, and even teetered on the brink of bankruptcy several times. 
 Things finally looked up for Smove in 2020. The firm had gotten rid of expensive long-term lease cars that numbered in the hundreds and was eyeing a path to profitability. 
 
  Smove Singapore is now undergoing liquidation. / Photo credit: Smove 
 
 But then Covid-19 struck, causing the company’s April revenues to drop by 85% compared to January. When the Singapore government decreed that nonessential businesses had to cease operations during the country’s circuit breaker period, co-founder Tom Lokenvitz decided it was the end of the road for Smove Singapore, the startup’s operations arm. 
 “We were already a sick patient when the pandemic started,” Lokenvitz tells  Tech in Asia  in an exclusive interview. “Since our revenue went to zero almost right away, we had no chance to continue operations and we were not able to meet our debt obligations. That’s why we needed to look into liquidation.” 
 He also clarified that contrary to erroneous media reports, parent firm Smove Systems will stay in business “for now.” 
 Burdened by leases 
 Operating off its fleet of leased cars, Smove offered customers a “free-floating service,” which means they can pick up a vehicle from the nearest location, drive to their destination, and drop off the vehicle at any of its designated drop-off points. At its peak, Smove had over 470 vehicles in its fleet, which were accessible at over 130 places around Singapore.

 It quickly gained popularity for its ease of use. Drivers only needed to tap a prepaid travel card called EZ-Link on a device attached to the cars to gain access. All Smove vehicles had a push-to-start button, so no keys were required, and they could be accessed 24/7 through its mobile app without the need to make a deposit. 
 “You skipped signing papers, going to an office, or other troublesome things that you have to do with traditional rental car companies,” says Lokenvitz. 
 And users could take the car for short drives, paying just S$1.25 (less than US$1) per 15-minute block, with mileage charges starting from S$0.21 (US$0.15) per kilometer, subject to petrol prices. For longer durations, prices start at S$50 (US$35) for a minimum booking of three hours, depending on the car category and usage type. 
 But the burden that dragged the car-sharing startup to its demise was the “unavoidable” monthly fees for long-term car leases that it signed in 2015. These vehicles cost S$1,800 (US$1,298) per month to rent, as those prices then were pegged to higher  Certificate of Entitlement  (COE) prices in 2015. 
 The decision to continue paying the long-term leases was “unsustainable” as the “unit economics did not make sense,” according to ex-Smove employees who spoke to  Tech in Asia  on condition of anonymity. As one of them points out, “If there are fixed monthly recurring costs in the form of leases for your car fleet on top of personnel costs, the impact of low to zero revenue is even larger for your cash position.” 
 So why did Smove sign off on such pricey long-term leases? Lokenvitz says that it was the most cost-effective solution at the time. 
 “When we were starting out with zero experience in the industry, we figured that if we do it more capital light by renting cars, we would only be concerned about monthly leasing costs, rather dealing with potentially hefty upfront payment requirements from buying our own cars,” he explains. “If we wanted to get a fleet of 500 cars and they cost S$100,000 (US$71,840) each including COE, the total amount of some S$50 million (US$35.9 million) in spare cash was something we didn’t have access to.”

 “Our mistake was not being able to get out of these long-lease contracts earlier,” adds Lokenvitz. Attempts to negotiate for lower rates or exit the arrangement early were unsuccessful, as the leasing company threatened to sue for the remaining contract value. 
 Looking back on the startup’s beginnings, when the team pivoted from electric vehicles to petrol cars, Lokenvitz says that if “they knew what they knew now,” they would’ve negotiated the termination clauses with the fleet provider differently. 
 Costs and losses 
 The long leases also put a damper on Smove’s price points, forcing the company to operate at an “immediate loss,”especially when the car rental market collapsed after  regulatory changes  and  Grab’s purchase of Uber’s Southeast Asia business  in March 2018.As such, Smove couldn’t raise prices to increase margins because it had to stay competitive. 
 Putting matters into perspective, Lokenvitz says that “majority” of the business was centered around hourly rentals, and the average car yielded revenues of S$2,600 to S$3,100 (US$1,860 to US$2,227) a month. Smove’s operating margins peaked at 10% to 15%, but they would fluctuate due to seasonal booking patterns, such as during public holidays, or more consumer rentals during school breaks. 
 Smove’s problem with profitability arose when its long-term leasing contracts for its fleet were no longer cost-efficient and sustainable, according to Lokenvitz. 
 According to financial filings seen by  Tech in Asia , Smove reported total losses of S$2.66 million (US$1.91 million) in 2018, going up from S$2.25 million (US$1.61 million) the year before. 
 These widening losses led Smove to hit the brakes on its expansion plans for Australia, where it had set up shop in March 2019.The team thought it was imperative to refocus its energies on extending the runaway of its Singapore unit and steer it back  to profitability. 
 In October 2019, the senior management decided to axe its entire headcount in Sydney as well as its marketing department in Singapore. 
 
  Smove’s ex-employees praised the company’s culture but said that retrenchments dealt a big blow to morale. / Photo credit: Smove 
 
 “It was pretty ugly, how they handled things,” says a former Smove Singapore employee.  “We were called into a meeting room before lunch and told we were getting retrenched. [We were] told to leave immediately.” 
 The source adds, “There was very little transparency about this as they told everyone that layoffs would be done fairly. But there was zero protocol in place.” Staff morale also took a hit after the job cuts, leading to resignations. 
 The sudden retrenchment “hurt” a lot of people, as Smove had built a working environment where “people genuinely cared for each other,” according to an ex-employee who “loved” the company and stayed on until May 2020. 
 While Lokenvitz laments how painful the process was and admits that they could have done some things differently,  the layoffs were necessary. ”We had to make a decision,” he says. 
 
  Smove’s entire fleet consisted of leased vehicles / Photo credit: Smove 
 
 After the cost-cutting measures, a solution was in sight earlier this year. Smove was on the cusp of linking up with a new provider that charged around S$1,200 (US$862) monthly to lease a car, saving the startup up to S$600 (US$431) per vehicle. 
 Smove was confident enough about its prospects to  quash media reports  that it was shutting down in February, saying instead that it was in fact expanding its fleet. 
 Lokenvitz reveals to  Tech in Asia  that it was looking to accelerate its partnership with the provider to add some 600 cars by mid-2020. “After phasing out the previous cars under expensive contracts, we were actually back on track towards profitability,” he adds. Smove Systems was also working towards another fundraise mid-2020, when it would have reached “overall profitability.” 
 In the end, Covid-19 put a stop to that plan. 
 The Uber hangover 
 Lokenvitz says that Smove never quite recovered from one setback: the abrupt suspension of its partnership with Uber in 2018, which happened after the San Francisco-based ride-hailer’s deal with Grab. 
 After inking an agreement in late 2015, Uber drivers were renting Smove’s leased cars on an hourly basis, broadening the use case for the Singaporean startup. 
 By early 2016, Smove began scaling up with Uber, with its fleet going from 30 cars to 350 in less than six months, and its workforce increasing threefold.

 Teaming up with Uber was a high point for Smove, recalls Lokenvitz, as operating margins finally turned positive to 10% to 15%, despite the fact that it still had to grapple with the costly car leases. 
 It even led to Smove’s first trial outside Singapore – in early 2017, it joined the ride-hailing rental market in Manila. Lokenvitz says the project was initially “promising,” but Smove had to pull out of the Philippines as Uber  lost its license  to operate in the capital in 2018. The two companies rolled out a function in Uber’s app designed to let users book Smove vehicles for consumer use. However, two weeks before the launch, the Grab-Uber merger happened. The move plunged Smove’s operating margins from May onwards deeply into the negative, as the car-sharing firm had lost its biggest partner. 
 “You have to keep in mind all the funds that were poured into our tech and product teams. All of Smove’s expansion plans and potential for further market entries just disappeared overnight,” shares Lokenvitz. 
 According to Smove, Uber had ambitions to boost its car-sharing capabilities – it was eyeing a similar product for the US and other core markets. But Grab had a different set of goals then, and car-sharing wasn’t part of it. Instead, the Southeast Asian unicorn was focused on expanding into super-app functions such as e-payments. 
 Grab did push Smove as a rental option for its drivers, though its rates weren’t as competitive as renting directly from Grab. Breaking down Smove’s usage statistics, Grab drivers took up 10% of its bookings over the last year, with consumer rentals still accounting for the bulk of trips and bookings at 90%. 
 Looking back on its partnership with Uber, Lokenvitz says he doesn’t regret it because any venture-back company would have been hard-pressed to pass up on a growth opportunity.  It also offered Smove a chance to showcase its capabilities “at a larger scale with a big tech player in the transportation industry.” 
 Moving on 
 While Smove Singapore is undergoing liquidation, Lokenvitz aims to  sell  intellectual property developed by Smove Systems “to get some value for [its] shareholders, creditors and employees” before shutting down the business completely. 
  Tech in Asia  reached out to Rebright Partners, 500 Startups, and Wavemaker Pacific, which participated in Smove’s US$1.1 million funding round in 2014. But the investors declined to comment, citing the sensitive nature of the liquidation process and the sale of Smove System’s intellectual property rights. 
 After nine years in the driver’s seat of a startup, Lokenvitz will take a few weeks off to “rest and reflect.” His personal life has also taken some twists and turns: He has tied the knot and is raising two daughters aged 3 and 5, but he had also lost his mother while Smove was restructuring and fundraising in 2018. 
 “I want to take time to properly reflect on the experience, but I would also like to pass the knowledge and experience on and put my entrepreneurial energy to good use,” he says. “As for what form in which that will take place – we’ll see after some time.” ",Joseph Gan,0,9,"[(1, 0.9757173), (2, 0.015214806)]","['Smove', 'Uber', 'COE']","['US', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'Uber', 'Manila', 'Sydney', 'Philippines', 'Smove', 'Australia']"

 The startup provides locally produced compact motorcycle storage (CMS), which enables motorcycle parking to be more “secured, accountable, and comfortable.” 
 According to the company, there are around 120 million motorcycles in Indonesia, and around 15% of them are in Jakarta, making the capital one of the most congested cities in the world. Moreover, the number of motorcycles on the road continues to increase by 7% yearly, while the annual growth of road surface in the archipelago is less than 0.1%, based on data from the country’s statistics office. 
 “With an approximately 60-square meter plot of land, one CMS module can cater up to 240 motorcycles, essentially eight times more productive than conventional off-street parking,” Kenneth Darmansjah, chief financial officer at Soul Parking, said. 
 To ensure the security of parked vehicles, the startup deploys CCTV cameras and hires parking attendants as well. And since the CMS is 100% designed and made in Indonesia, it can be adjusted to fit the shape and size of each plot of land, the company said. 
 With the fresh capital, Soul Parking is looking to build 10 CMS modules this year. It currently has three units in its first location in Jakarta at Kebon Kacang area, where it claims thousands of motorcycles park every day. 
 Part of the new funds will also go toward the development of apps with parking discovery, booking, and payment features. Soul Parking plans to launch them by the end of this month. 
 Across Asia, there are other startups developing smart parking solutions to address traffic and parking issues in key cities. For example, Indian app Park+, which is being developed by a former Tokopedia exec, has recently raised  US$11 million  from Sequoia India and other investors ahead of its launch. There’s also Get My Parking, which operates in Indonesia as well. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.99962485)]","['Tokopedia', 'CMS', 'CCTV']","['Indonesia', 'Jakarta']"

649236,Fireside Chat with Chatri Sityodtong," One Championship is not often seen as a tech company, but the sports media unicorn’s founder, chairman, and CEO Chatri Sityodtong begs to differ with this perception. He explained why during a fireside chat with  Tech in Asia  on June 4. 
 According to him, broadcasting content, whether to one country or 150 countries, has an incremental margin of 100% for a media company. He compared this to a software company growing its product by selling it to customers at no additional cost to the business. 
 With everyone deriving “massive economic value” from sports, Sityodtong sees sports media properties as the ultimate platform business. Furthermore, he believes that One Championship is onto something indestructible, especially after the company has reached scale and with its current ranking as one of the top sports media properties in the world. 
   ﻿   
 One out of three Asians tuning in 
 The founder’s long-term goal is for the company to eventually overtake the US’s National Football League and take the top spot globally. More specifically, this is how he envisions success: Having one in every three Asians tuning in live to One Championship’s events. He took this metric from the Super Bowl viewership in October, where one out of three Americans tuned in to watch the annual football championship. 
 And Sityodtong is very optimistic about achieving this as he sees limitless opportunities for digital products, especially with how big livestreaming has become. 
  The Apprentice  
 People also do not usually associate One Championship with reality television. That is going to change, however, with the upcoming launch of  The Apprentice: One Championship Edition , a television show conceptualized by Sityodtong’s team in an effort to find content that would cater to the general audience. 
 The basis of  The Apprentice  franchise remains largely intact – business people competing for the US$250,000 job offer to work under a CEO for a year – but Sityodtong is also adding some twists. 
 Contestants will be pitted against 12 world champions in a series of adventure challenges such as rock climbing and eating spiders, and they will be judged by some of Asia’s top CEOs, which include Patrick Grove from Iflix and Ankiti Bose from Zilingo. 
 This is the first project for One Studios, the company’s television and film production division launched in April 2019, and Sityodtong is kicking it off with a bang: He wants the series to be the most watched  The Apprentice  franchise in history. 
 Thriving amid the pandemic 
 The Covid-19 pandemic has sent shockwaves across the sports media industry and One Championship has not been spared. All of its global live martial arts events have been postponed. 
 However, that has not dampened Sityodtong’s mood. With most people stuck at home, the company is seeing record-breaking growth in its organic social and digital video views, and sales of online merchandise have skyrocketed. 
 Currently, Sityodtong is focused on expanding digital partnerships to help grow One Championship’s content even more.

649188,Singapore’s Nium announces Visa card issuance services in Australia," Singapore-based fintech firm  Nium  announced today that it can now issue Visa cards in Australia as part of its ongoing partnership with the payments giant. 
 The announcement comes after the startup  raised funding  from Visa last month.

 With the Visa issuance license, Nium can conduct real-time fund transfers to physical and virtual Visa credit and debit cards and enable in-store, online, and ATM payments through tokenization, as well as facilitate payments via multicurrency cards with multi-wallet spend management features. 
 It aims to streamline the process so businesses can easily operate digital wallets that can be used with Visa-supported POS systems. 
 The startup claims the new service, which was first launched in Singapore, can shorten the lead time for Visa card issuance from the usual six months to four to six weeks. 
 According to Nium, many business owners still rely on outdated card management systems, with limited or no digital access. White-labeling card solutions can help them become more cost-efficient. 
 “The flexibility of our APIs tools and turnkey infrastructure, coupled with Visa products and services, allow us to support different use cases […],” said Gitesh Athavale, head of product (cards) at Nium. 
 Nium is part of  Visa’s Fintech Fast Track program, which helps fintech startups build and deliver new commerce experiences on Visa’s network.   
 The company currently operates in Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and the US. It claims to be processing billions of dollars in transactions a year. 
 Other fintech companies in Asia Pacific issuing Visa cards include Sequoia-backed unicorn Airwallex, which raised  US$160 million  in April. It has launched borderless cards with Visa, enabling businesses to pay suppliers and let employees make corporate purchases.

 A startup that aims to solve the world’s plastic crisis raised a ton of money, so Joseph Gan decided to explore the science behind it and see if it stands up to scrutiny. 
   There’s no such thing as a perfect layoff   
 It sucks to be on the receiving end of layoffs, and it sucks as well to be the one who has to do it. While Airbnb has set the standard for conducting a retrenchment, it has one thing many startups don’t: a ton of resources.

649177,"Behind Oyo’s layoffs in Malaysia, which affected hundreds of people"," India-headquartered budget hotel chain Oyo cut hundreds of employees – or most of the team – in Malaysia this year, five affected ex-staff tell  Tech in Asia . 
 The retrenchments, which have gone unreported by the media, were meant to remove excess overhead and help Oyo reach profitability. It was also meant to slash costs amid a pandemic that has ravaged the travel industry. 
 The company declined to reveal exactly how many people were affected, but it says its current workforce has around 100 people. Sources say that the company peaked at 600 employees last year.

 The first wave of job cuts, which came in January before the full effects of the pandemic were felt, were part of a  global cost-cutting initiative . 
 “We realized that we hired more people than we required to have a sustainable and profitable company. We apologized for that,” Mandar Vaidya, Oyo’s chief executive for Southeast Asia and the Middle East region, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Furlough with no job guarantee 
 On April 9, Oyo’s CEO and co-founder Ritesh Agarwal told the   Financial Times   that the company intended to have “no or negligible layoffs” as a result of Covid-19. This applied to all of Oyo’s operations, including Malaysia, Vaidya adds. 
 The company tells us that more departures happened in January rather than in April, when another round of retrenchments occured. Regardless, the cost-cutting measures have happened throughout 2020. 
 As Oyo’s revenue plunged by 50% to 60% due to the pandemic, it laid off or furloughed  hundreds  of employees in Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. It’s also shedding the majority of its staff in the UK, the company  previously said . 
 The furloughs in Malaysia came with no job guarantees at the end of the process, according to former employees. That “was a deal breaker for me. I was not willing to take that risk,” said one former staff member. 
 Some employees who rejected the furlough, which came with limited entitlements, had resigned instead, Vaidya says. 
 Oyo did not tell  Tech in Asia  what benefits came with taking the temporary leave, but ex-employees say furloughed staff did not receive their full salary. Instead, they got an “ex-gratia” payment that amounted to 45% of their one month’s salary doled out over three months, with full medical benefits. 
 Gradual fall 
 According to Vaidya, Southeast Asia has contributed to Oyo’s growth. And Indonesia and Malaysia in particular are its most important markets in the region, accounting for 45% and 20% of its revenue in the domain, respectively. 
 After China, Southeast Asia is the second market where Oyo saw an impact on its business due to the pandemic. In late February 2020, the company had seen the early signs of a plunge in demand, which was made worse over the following months when countries began applying lockdowns and social restrictions, Vaidya says. 
 “In countries or regions where there is a lockdown and customers are not allowed to move, we saw the occupancy drop close to zero. In countries like Indonesia where there is no central formal lockdown, it’s more like a gradual fall,” he explains. 
 Responding to the dive in demand, Oyo Malaysia tried to cut any insignificant fixed cost first, including travel, printing, utilities, and stationery expenses. But that wasn’t enough, so the company reduced salaries at the executive level. This move was announced via an email to all employees, which stated that “high managerial level” employees would have a 25% reduction in fixed compensation from April to July 2020. 
 The company realized, however, that the move would still not suffice and that a wider salary reduction exercise would also fall short. Finally, Oyo offered furloughs – or leaves with limited benefits – for employees that did not get a salary reduction option.

 When asked which employees were eligible for salary cuts – which many preferred over furloughs or retrenchment – Oyo says that it didn’t offer the option to most “junior level employees” and people with low salaries. 
 Staffers who didn’t have work due to the dip in demand were more likely to be furloughed or retrenched as well, Vaidya adds. 
 Former employees, however, were left with many questions when the cost-cutting exercise was carried out. 
 While Ming Luk Tan, Oyo’s country head for Malaysia and Singapore, contends that the process had been explained in detail to all employees, many former staff disagreed. 
 The rationale “was not communicated to me,” says a former employee who wasn’t given a salary reduction offer. “I hold a head position; [I’m] not sure if that is low-level.” 
 Some staff, meanwhile, felt they were rushed into making a decision between accepting a furlough or leaving the company. A former employee says that they were asked to respond by 5 pm of the same day they were presented with the options. 
 Oyo says, however, that the company didn’t set a deadline. All employees that didn’t resign or get retrenched were automatically furloughed. 
 “We tried to have a discussion with each of them. With some of them, there was only one conversation, but for some others we had three to four discussions,” Tan says. 
 “There is no work available” 
 For the people who chose to resign from the company, there was another problem. In Malaysia, the government’s Employment Insurance System (EIS) provides benefits for retrenched employees. Resigned staff, however, are not eligible for the claims. 
 After Oyo considered the impact of the EIS on its resigned workers, it opted to say that all of them had been retrenched instead. 
 “Some employees said, ‘Could you give us a letter of retrenchment that allows us to access the government’s benefits?’ We said, ‘Fine, we will provide that,’” Vaidya explains. 
 In an official letter of retrenchment for an employee seen by  Tech in Asia , Oyo wrote “As there is currently no work available at all, we are not requesting you to serve out your notice period. In this regard, salary in lieu of notice will be made.”

 However, some employees were unhappy about the retrenchment package they received. The company gave them 10 days of notice for each year they served the firm. While this is in line with  Malaysia’s employment law , the employees’ offer letter had initially stated that they would be given a notice of two months, three sources say. 
 Retrenched staff were offered severance pay, leave encashment, and salary in lieu of notice – a payment made to employees for not serving a notice period. However, the salary in lieu was to be given in installments for a three-month period, instead of the one-off payment they were expecting. Some people who rejected the offer were told by Oyo’s HR department that the package was final. 
 The company declined to reveal what compensation they offered but said it paid whatever was required by regulators. 
 After the exercise, Oyo says it also helped some employees find new jobs, though some sources say they never received such assistance. 
 ESOP for all employees 
 The company has now opted to better recognize current staff members. In an email seen by  Tech in Asia , Oyo is preparing to expand its employee stock option plan (ESOP) to all of its existing staff worldwide. Team members with existing stock options will be able to receive them sooner. 
 Retrenched workers, however, will not be eligible for this scheme, and the company says that it is still finalizing the mechanism of the new ESOP. 
 “I will forever be grateful to you for understanding this situation and giving the company the runway required to work towards recovery,” Agarwal wrote in the email announcing the initiative.

 In the same email, he also said that there is a high chance that the travel industry will take longer to recover, which Vaidya says refers to the uncertainty of how long the pandemic will last. 
 “Although two months has passed, it is still early days. Once we go out of the lockdown, we will see how consumers behave,” shares Vaidya. 
 Besides Oyo, other budget hotel aggregators like RedDoorz have also carried out  cost-cutting measures, salary reductions, layoffs, and temporary furloughs , while Airy decided to  close down its operations permanently .

 Called Ayannah Global, the new entity will be headquartered in Singapore, a strategic location among fast-growing markets in Southeast Asia. It also aims to draw from the city-state’s talent pool and forge new partnerships with companies there. 
 “Both companies saw huge operational and technological synergies in their products and growth strategy, and a merger will enable the enlarged entity to better reach customers, scale up product development, and expand their reach within Southeast Asia,” a spokesperson for Ayannah Global told  Tech in Asia.  
 The company also looks to capitalize on the greater demand for open banking and omnichannel distribution platforms driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, the spokesperson added. 
 Founded in 2010,  Ayannah developed an AI-enabled platform to launch a suite of financial and lifestyle products and services ranging from payments, remittances, insurance, and telemedicine.   
  See:  Forget e-wallets. Ayannah taps agents to serve the unbanked and it’s growing fast   
 Meanwhile, Bengaluru-based ECAPS caters to the needs of domestic migrants and the unbanked population in India. It enables domestic money transfers, utility bill payments, recharges, and travel ticketing. 
 Together, Ayannah and ECAPS have operations in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. After the merger, Ayannah Global looks to extend its reach into Vietnam. It expects to reach over 10 million customers in these markets through its mobile apps and a growing network of over 60,000 offline touchpoints, the new entity said. 
 In addition to the merger, the company said it will start raising money for its series B round on June 15. It looks to bag US$30 million to US$50 million through the round. 
 Ayannah’s existing backers from previous fundraising rounds include Wavemaker Partners, Golden Gate Ventures, and 500 Startups, as well as several large family offices across Asia.

649153,Grab unveils B2B marketplace to help small businesses go online," Southeast Asian ride-hailing giant  Grab  today announced a business-to-business service called GrabMerchant to help small businesses across the region go and grow online.

 GrabMerchant is a self-serve platform where Grab’s merchant-partners can purchase supplies at wholesale rates. It also allows food businesses to build their online stores on the Grab app, set up cashless payment options, and create their own ads. The platform also offers an insight tool where users can keep track of their sales, operations, customers’ behavior, and marketing performance. 
 GrabMerchant will be available as a mobile app starting this month, according to a statement. A web portal will also be rolled out in July in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. 
 The new service is part of Grab’s Small Business Booster Programme, which aims to help small businesses adapt to the “new normal.” 
 Under the initiative, Grab will also launch an offline-to-online merchant support program to help businesses integrate GrabPay with their online stores. Grab said this will build on its Remote GrabPay Link solution, which gives merchants a URL that they can send to customers to facilitate payments. The new service will be launched in Singapore first, then in Malaysia and the Philippines in the coming weeks. 
 A new feature called Merchant Discovery will also be rolled out to increase merchants’ visibility on the Grab app through the Nearby Merchants widget. The company said it will also create free personalized ads worth US$3.5 million for 6,000 local businesses across the region starting July. 
 “Covid-19 has accelerated change. We have seen dependency on online services grow exponentially almost overnight,” Grab co-founder Hooi Ling Tan observed. She also noted that small businesses make up the backbone of the region’s economy, yet only  34%  of them have an online presence. 
 Apart from its B2B initiatives, Grab also said it’s working with governments in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand to connect rural entrepreneurs to the digital economy and enable farmers and agricultural stakeholders to earn directly from sales off the Grab platform. 
 Grab claims over 78,000 merchants were onboarded to its platform between March and April, with small businesses seeing a 21% increase in online revenue during the pandemic.

649140,12-year-old programmer tackles Apple’s first student coding contest," As developers across the globe await the start of Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 22, a group of young programmers will soon find out which of them won the tech giant’s first coding competition for kids. 
 The Swift Student Challenge is a virtual competition designed to help kids learn how to code using Apple’s five-year-old Swift programming language. The competition is based around Swift Playgrounds, an educational app introduced in 2016 to teach beginners the basics of coding. 
 To move an animated cyclops character through an increasingly complicated set of digital mazes, players have to make use of the programming concepts they picked up along the way. Once they finish the lessons, kids can build their own mini projects in the app using Swift.

 Jacob Prohaska, a 12-year-old student at Renaissance College in Hong Kong, is one of the youngest entrants in Apple’s new competition. An avid  Dungeons &amp; Dragons  player, he said he has always loved creating his own games and wanted a way to digitize them. Playgrounds became his starting point. 
 “In around Year 3 [at school], I found out about this app called Swift Playgrounds. And I had a lot of fun tinkering with it, trying out the different features and just having fun with it,” said Prohaska as he opened Playgrounds on his iPad to explain the fundamentals of Swift coding to adult noobs like me. 
 Working through levels in Playgrounds requires a decent amount of patience and concentration, something you don’t always find in kids his age – except maybe when they’re playing  Fortnite  or  Minecraft . I asked Prohaska to show me a stage that he had never worked on. For around 10 minutes, his mind was solely focused on solving the puzzle in front of him and explaining to me his thought process. 
 Coding in Playgrounds proved challenging. Prohaska said he spent hours a day coding in the app while he was working on his contest submission, though he “calmed down with the coding” after that. But he also said it’s why he enjoys it so much. 
 “I really love how after you’ve worked really hard on a project, you see that it just works,” he explained. “I’ve had many moments when I think my code is perfect and there’ve been problems in it. And that made me a little frustrated… [but] I’ve found many strategies to overcome problems not just in code, but also in real life.” 
 Playgrounds might be a fun way to welcome kids into the world of programming, but it does have its limitations. You can build a project within Playgrounds, but the project isn’t a standalone app. For the Swift Student Challenge, Prohaska submitted a Blackjack-like card game where a player wins if they become the first to accumulate 20 points worth of cards. This game exists solely within the realm of Playgrounds – you can’t play it outside the app. 
 For anyone who wants to build a standalone app, they’ll have to move from Playgrounds to Xcode – the full suite of tools that allows people to build real software for the operating systems running on iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, and other Apple devices. That’s far more challenging than completing simple tasks in Playgrounds. And in any case, if you want to go beyond Apple’s ecosystem, you’ll have to go elsewhere to learn languages like Python and Javascript. 
 It was a challenge that Prohaska faced when he was looking for ideas for his contest submission. 
 “I was really, really stuck and I did not know where to start. I mean this was after I used Swift Playgrounds and I wanted to move on to Xcode, but I did not know how to get the help I wanted,” he said. 
 He ended up taking online classes from an instructor he found on the internet. It’s a reminder that it likely takes more than just an app and a (US$330) iPad for coding beginners to really get a firm grasp of the skills needed to become a full-fledged programmer. 
 Still, Prohaska suggests that Playgrounds can serve as a good starting point for other kids who want to dabble in programming. 
 “My advice is to start small because if you jump into a big project, then it can be very confusing and stressful,” he said. “I think that the way I approached it was a good way because I started small using Swift Playgrounds, and I learned all the basics.” 
 The result of the Swift Student Challenge will be announced on June 16, Pacific time. Apple says the winners will receive “an exclusive WWDC20 jacket and pin set.”

649135,Deep Dive: The cloud kitchen phenomenon,"    
 Cloud kitchens have become increasingly prominent in the past couple of years, with players like Grab, Foodpanda, and Deliveroo setting up their own operations. 
 The vertical is a gamechanger for the food ecosystem, with food delivery platforms emerging as the big winners because they stand to see their order numbers grow. But it’s a different story for restaurants despite the perks that they can get by signing up with cloud kitchens.

 ADIA will take a 1.2% equity stake in Jio, while Silver Lake’s investment will now translate into a 2.1% equity stake on a fully diluted basis. Silver Lake and co-investors have now invested a total of US$1.4 billion in Jio after announcing a  US$747 million  injection last month. 
 ADIA is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world with about  US$580 billion  in assets, according to Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. 
 “Jio Platforms is at the forefront of India’s digital revolution, poised to benefit from major socioeconomic developments and the transformative effects of technology on the way people live and work,” Hamad Shahwan Aldhaheri, executive director of the private equities department at ADIA, said. 
 With more than 388 million subscribers across India, Jio Platforms’ digital ecosystem is composed of network, devices, apps, content, and services, among others. It looks to enable a digital India for 1.3 billion people and businesses across the country, including small merchants, microbusinesses, and farmers. 
 According to Statista, India is the  second-largest online market  with over 560 million internet users, just behind China. It also has around 50% internet penetration rate as of this year. It’s expected that India will see over 650 million internet users by 2023. 
 Jio is up against Airtel and Vodafone in the telco and internet spaces in the country. Just last week, it was reported that US ecommerce giant Amazon is in talks for a  US$2 billion  stake in Airtel. India is an important market for Amazon, which has committed around US$6.5 billion for its expansion in the country.

649101,WeWork co-founder Miguel McKelvey to leave the company," “At the end of this month, I’ll be leaving WeWork,” wrote Miguel McKelvey, WeWork’s co-founder and chief culture officer, in a LinkedIn post. 
 The news comes after the the firm’s CEO and co-founder, Adam Neumann, left the firm last year.

 Before McKelvey’s exit, Neumann had stepped down from his role following WeWork’s failed attempt at going public last year. He was then replaced by Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham as co-CEOs, until Sandeep Mathrani was appointed CEO early this year. 
 “While it’s hard to leave, and I know there is a lot more work to be done, I could only make this decision knowing this company and our people are in good hands,” McKelvey added. 
 The development comes amid the SoftBank-backed company’s ongoing five-year strategic and financial plan, which includes goals of becoming free cash flow-positive by 2022 and reaching about US$1 billion of free cash flow by 2024. 
 The plan was laid out in March 26 this year under the leadership of Mathrani and Marcelo Claure, executive chairman of WeWork and current CEO of SoftBank. 
 Separately, WeWork said it will be investing US$100 million in its India operations. WeWork India plans to use the funds for “focused growth” locally over the next 36 months, according to a  Reuters  report. 
 Earlier in May, WeWork India laid off 100 employees, representing about 20% of its total workforce in the country, in an effort to save cash amid the pandemic. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.17971863), (2, 0.81982666)]","['Reuters', 'WeWork', 'SoftBank']","['Asia', 'India']"
649083,JD.com looks to raise over $4b in Hong Kong listing," China’s  JD.com  is looking to raise up to HK$35.6 billion (US$4.6 billion) in its second listing in Hong Kong.

 In a prospectus dated June 8, the ecommerce major said it will be offering 133 million new shares, priced at HK$236 apiece, to raise about HK$31.4 billion (US$4.05 billion). Of those shares, 6.65 million will be offered locally while the remaining will be offered internationally. 
 If the overallotment option is exercised in full, that amount will be bumped up to US$4.6 billion, the company said, adding that it plans to use the proceeds to fuel supply chain-based tech initiatives. 
 Specifically, it will continue investing in key operational systems, such as its smart pricing and inventory management system, customer service solutions, and omnichannel smart retail platform. It also aims to build a suite of in-house logistics systems and bolster its research and development team. 
 The Walmart-backed company aims to begin trading on June 18. 
 JD.com will become just the third company to launch a secondary listing in Hong Kong. It is also expected to be the largest Hong Kong public offering so far this year. Chinese internet giant NetEase is also seeking around US$2.7 billion in a stock sale in the city. 
 These moves follow Alibaba’s successful US$13 billion Hong Kong offering last year. 
 JD.com and NetEase are just two of the Chinese companies expected to list in the city this year, as escalating tensions between the US and China continue to pose great risk. It was earlier reported that other tech giants such as search engine Baidu, fast-food firm Yum China, and travel agency Ctrip are also eyeing secondary listings in Hong Kong

648754,How Covid-19 has changed the media industry in Asia," The spread of Covid-19 has crippled many industries such as tourism and airlines, yet it has also been a boon for ecommerce and food delivery services. 
 However, the effect of the pandemic on the region’s media and content players is less straightforward. What is clear is that it has changed media and content consumption patterns across the continent – perhaps irrevocably.

 A surge in news, education, and gaming 
 In March,  Nielsen’s study  on how Covid-19 has affected North Asian media found that television viewing and engagement numbers in February skyrocketed by as much as 57% compared to the same period in 2019 – a predictable scenario once lockdowns were put in place. 
 TV and online news consumption also jumped as people kept up with the latest Covid-19 developments, and then later sought out food recipes, ecommerce deals, and tips on living through lockdowns. Naturally, social media usage also spiked as more traditional shops and service providers started using its platforms to engage with buyers. 
 A  Comscore study  that surveyed Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia, Vietnam, and Singapore corresponded with Nielsen’s findings in North Asia, revealing that news sites in the region experienced a rise in traffic by as much as 36% in February compared to a month prior. 
 Parsing the data further, Nielsen noted that viewership of children’s programming and education shows saw the largest spikes of up to 50%, which isn’t that surprising, since many schools and universities had been conducting virtual learning sessions and parents were searching for ways to keep children entertained at home. 
 Across Asia Pacific, the consumption of video and gaming content has surged across all age groups. School closures have given over-the-top media and streaming services such as Hong Kong’s Viu and China’s iQiyi  a boost . Similar players sought to capitalize on this, with Malaysia’s Iflix  offering free membership  for a few months to draw in new users and Disney offering its Hotstar streaming app  for free  to Singapore’s large migrant worker population. 
 Firms like Netflix and YouTube, on the other hand, are playing a numbers game, choosing to  lower the quality of their videos  so that people in areas with low bandwidth can still access their content libraries. 
  A survey  conducted by Media Partners Asia found that mobile streaming in Southeast Asia increased by a whopping 60%, from 36.4 billion weekly minutes in mid-January to 58 billion minutes per week by April 11. 
 Print media and ad spend suffer 
 But not all of Asia’s media and content players are benefiting from this shift online. 
 Traditional print media across the continent have suffered major losses. Newspapers in the Philippines, India, Vietnam, and Australia  have suspended operations  for the time being, while Blu Inc, a major magazine publishing group in Malaysia, closed its doors for good in March. 
 Players who didn’t already have a digital roadmap are paying the price as Covid-19 lockdowns cripple distribution networks, and the fear of transmitting the virus sends people to online news sites instead. With social distancing expected to be the new norm even after the pandemic blows over, it is highly unlikely that companies that have “temporarily” stopped their printing presses will return. 
 But while one would expect digital advertising revenue to rise given the larger audience numbers,  a Deloitte study  found that marketers are keeping their powder dry to see if the current consumption trends hold up. 
 Case in point: Chinese digital content producer Xinchao Media  axed more than 10%  of its 4,500 staffers while Malaysia’s Iflix  laid off 50 of its employees . Online platforms are also projecting declines in ad revenue as consumers hold back on discretionary spending. 
 A new normal for media and content creation 
 The same Deloitte study pointed out that advertisers are starting to develop content that speaks to the current situation. One company that has taken this to heart is Spotify. The music-streaming service, which hit  130 million subscribers  amid Covid-19,  launched a pilot self-service Ad Studio platform  in Asia in mid-April. 
 Ad Studio allows brands in the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan to create and manage audio campaigns directly. Alternatively, marketers can upload a script, which Spotify will turn into an audio ad within 48 hours. The launch came at a perfect time: With creative teams unable to work together onsite and marketing budgets being slashed, the need for automation and self-service products is rising. 
 The higher appetite for news has also sent more users to social media sites such as Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. These platforms support entire media ecosystems made up of news networks, independent content creators, and corporate players. The abundance of data has led to the development of adaptive recommendation engine algorithms that can craft tailored content selections for consumers. 
 With work-from-home and self-isolation measures expected to last for at least a year, brands can effectively tap into the reach of these platforms.  Apps like Douyin  (owned by China’s ByteDance) understand this and have capitalized on it by allowing users to immediately search for and purchase clothing and other goods they’ve seen in videos. 
 Going forward, VCs and angel investors need to invest in media and content players that can help bridge gaps. These include ad agencies that can design for mobile and online content producers that don’t depend solely on advertising revenue but also act as unique marketplaces. 
 One such partnership is between Chinese mobile app player  Imaginato and Astro GoShop , the ecommerce platform of Malaysia’s media and entertainment group Astro. The tie-up aims to further help brick-and-mortar Malaysian businesses market and connect with customers online. 
 If investors are willing to support business models that produce worthwhile content – be it new startups or legacy media outlets trying to revamp their product offerings – the media and content industry will be primed to grow once marketers and advertisers start spending again.

649039,Gojek’s video-streaming service independently raises money," Gojek’s video-streaming service  GoPlay  has closed its first independent funding round led by ZWC Partners and Golden Gate Ventures, along with Openspace Ventures, Ideosource Entertainment, and Redbadge Pacific. 
 This comes less than a week after Gojek announced new investments  from Facebook, PayPal, Google, and Tencent  as part of its ongoing series F round.

 GoPlay was  launched  in September last year to bridge the gap between mobile audiences and the country’s growing entertainment industry. 
 It serves as a platform for Indonesian filmmakers to introduce and distribute their work to a broader market, while providing consumers with access to locally produced movies and shows. It claims to have served hundreds of thousands of mobile users to date. 
 Last week, it was  reported  that Gojek would be spinning off GoPlay, which had secured about US$15 million in funding. Gojek declined to comment on the matter. 
 The new capital injection announced today will be used to enhance GoPlay’s technology to help local filmmakers better meet consumer demand for high-quality local content, according to a statement. 
 “Indonesia’s local pool of content creators need more avenues to showcase their talent, while our growing pool of mobile consumers want access to more local content at their fingertips,” said Edy Sulistyo, CEO of GoPlay. “There is huge potential here that is not being addressed by commercial movie theaters, and we are working hard to close the gap between supply and demand.” 
 According to Statista, Indonesia is the  fourth-largest  smartphone market globally after China, India, and the US. Its video-streaming sector raked in  US$172 million  in revenue in 2020 and is expected to reach US$274 million by 2024. 
 Some big players across Southeast Asia include US-based streaming giant Netflix, Malaysia-based Iflix – which just  partnered with short-video platform TikTok  – and Hong Kong-based Viu. Gojek’s archrival Grab partnered with Hooq before, but the Singtel-backed video streamer had  filed for liquidation  earlier this year.

 With the Special Situation Fund for Startups (SSFS), EDBI and Seeds Capital will invest in selected startups with private sector co-investors on a one-to-one basis, according to a statement. 
 EDBI is the corporate investment arm of Singapore’s Economic Development Board, while Seeds Capital is Enterprise Singapore’s funding unit. 
 According to the announcement, the SSFS will support early- to late-stage companies that could contribute to the city-state’s national priorities. EDBI will focus on late-stage startups with larger funding needs and bigger teams, while Seeds Capital will focus on early-stage startups. 
 To be eligible for the special funding, a startup must be incorporated as a private limited company with headquarters and key value-added activities in Singapore. It should also possess strategic capabilities such as technology and innovation competencies or sustainable competitive advantages, according to the statement. 
 In addition, a startup should have substantial innovative or intellectual property content developed or owned in-house and a commercially viable business model. It must be able to articulate its scalability in its target customer segments and globally. A startup should also have a capable management team and strong corporate governance. 
 “We look forward to working with partner funds to support technology startups so they can continue to execute their growth plans [and] build strategic capabilities in Singapore, continue with their innovation activities and expansion plans to capture new market opportunities,” Swee Yeok Chu, CEO and president of EDBI, said. 
 The scheme was first announced by Deputy Prime Minister Swee Keat Heng in the budget speech last month. It will end once the funds are fully committed or by October 31, 2021, whichever is earlier.

649053,Ovo’s lending arm Taralite secures P2P license," Indonesian fintech major  Ovo  today announced that its peer-to-peer lending arm Taralite has been awarded a business license by the Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK).

 Officially operating as an IT-based lending provider, Ovo and Taralite said they will continue to work with the government to bring Indonesia’s micro, small, and medium enterprises closer to digital financial services. 
 According to Indonesia’s central statistics agency, MSMEs contribute roughly 60% of Indonesia’s GDP and absorbs over 97% of the national workforce. As of last year, however, more than 77% of Indonesians were reportedly unbanked or underbanked. 
 “We hope that this [license acquisition] will boost financial inclusion rates and help the financial landscape in Indonesia become less fragmented,” said Ovo CEO Jason Thompson. 
 Taralite, which was founded in 2015, was acquired by Ovo last year as part of its plans to expand its reach into financial services. It also recently launched  DanaTara , a service that gives MSMEs access to financing of up to 500 million rupiah (about US$35,600) with terms of up to 12 months. 
 Ovo claims that the amount of loans disbursed by Taralite has grown by nearly 50% since the start of 2020. It also said that it has an ecosystem of about 500,000 MSMEs so far. 
 The OJK started officially regulating online lending services in 2017, recognizing the industry’s rapid growth over the previous years. 
 The regulation requires service providers to have 1 billion rupiah (US$71,300) in capital and prohibits them from conducting other businesses outside of P2P lending, such as acting as a lender or borrower themselves, among others. 
 Other companies that have recently acquired OJK licenses this month are Pinjam Modal, Danarupiah, Pinjamwinwin, Julo, Indodana, Awantunai, and Alami. 
 In October last year, OJK also issued licenses to six other fintech firms, including Modalku (aka Funding Societies) and  Finmas , among others.

648978,"Analysis: Facebook, PayPal will help Gojek win Indonesia, but not Southeast Asia","  Earlier this week , Gojek announced that it received investment from US-based tech giants Facebook and PayPal. Both firms join existing backers Google and Tencent who also participated in this funding round. 
 The deal not only gives Gojek the cash it needs to ride out the pandemic, which has affected its  ride-hailing  and  food delivery  volumes, but it will also help the Indonesian unicorn in its bid to conquer digital payments in its home country.

 Looking outside of Indonesia, things are more complicated. The new investment is unlikely to help Gojek make a dent on Grab’s dominance in other Southeast Asian countries. In fact, it’s unclear how much importance Gojek is putting on its regional expansion, as Indonesia remains a must-win market for any consumer tech firm in the region due to its size. 
 That being said, Facebook’s backing could set the table for more capital injections that may bring the company closer to amassing a war chest that can rival Grab’s. 
 At the moment, Grab leads Gojek by a wide margin in terms of active users in Southeast Asia, according to third-party estimates seen by  Tech in Asia . But while Gojek has a lead over Grab in the same metric in Indonesia, the gap is smaller. 
 Win-win in Indonesia 
 The latest investment brings Gojek’s series F fundraise over the US$3 billion mark, according to the company. This implies that it has raised an additional US$800 million since its last announcement in March. 
    
     
 Facebook’s investment in Gojek marks the social media giant’s first capital injection in an Indonesian firm. Gojek’s payment arm GoPay, which is ubiquitous in the country, may have been a key consideration in Facebook’s decision. 
 Currently, the payment service is only active in Indonesia – it operates in other countries via a partnership model – and is competing against Grab’s digital payment partner Ovo. GrabPay, meanwhile, is available in five countries. 
    
     
 For the social network, the recent deal could mark a breakthrough in its attempt to penetrate Indonesia’s payments market. 
 Prior to this, Facebook had tried to enter the Indonesian payments space by approaching three of the country’s major players, GoPay, Ovo, and LinkAja, a source familiar with the discussions told  Tech in Asia . The aim was to bring a peer-to-peer transfer service to WhatsApp, which would allow the app’s users to send money from their GoPay, Ovo, or LinkAja accounts. 
 According to the person, the integrations have not materialized. 
 Parallel to these efforts, Facebook has been rolling out its own payments feature, Facebook Pay, in several countries. The service will allow users to transact inside the social media giant’s platforms: Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. 
 With Facebook Pay, for example, users can buy a product they see on their news feeds or send money to their WhatsApp friends directly on these apps. 
 
  Example of Facebook Pay usage / Source: Facebook 
 
 In Asia, the social media firm has launched the feature in Taiwan, Malaysia, and Vietnam, according to its website. 
 With its investment in Gojek, Facebook could launch the service in Indonesia with GoPay as a payment option. This move would deepen Facebook Pay’s reach among many users in Indonesia, considering the low penetration rate of credit cards, alternative payment methods like PayPal, and even bank accounts in the country. 
    
  This chart of Grab and Gojek investors is interactive. You can pan, zoom in and out, and view specific data points.  
 Meanwhile, the benefit for Gojek is clear: Facebook Pay could help set the stage for true social commerce in the country, where the entire purchase journey for consumers would happen within the social network. A lot of those payments would be processed by GoPay. 
 “The main value of the deal is the partnership with Facebook,” says Hian Goh, co-founder and managing partner of Openspace Ventures, which has also invested in Gojek. 
 But there’s a caveat: Some venture capitalists doubt that the collaboration will be exclusive. Over time, users can expect Facebook to add GoPay’s competitors like Ovo and LinkAja to the list of payment options. If Facebook Pay is rolled out to other countries in Southeast Asia, the company may open the platform to more providers. 
 “It’s less likely to be exclusive because Facebook must want to give the most convenient experience to users,” says Aldi Adrian Hartanto, vice president of investment at MDI Ventures. 
 That said, Gojek may still have an advantage in the Facebook ecosystem, as it is now part of the company’s investment portfolio, the sources speculate. Facebook could prioritize GoPay as its payment option in the country, for instance.

 At the same time, the social media titan can also pursue deeper integrations between WhatsApp and the other payments-related services under Gojek’s belt, such as payment gateway Midtrans and point-of-sale app Moka. 
 “[Gojek’s] ecosystem will eventually give WhatsApp Pay a wide reach outside of GoPay and potentially embed itself deeper into the business processes of MSMEs,” says Hiro Kiga, chief operating officer of cross-border payments startup Wallex. Facebook is already  pursuing a similar strategy  in India, where it hopes to position WhatsApp as a way for local mom and pop shops to buy wholesale goods. 
 But with a Facebook-Gojek integration having potentially far-reaching effects, how does PayPal fit into the picture? According to the press release announcing the deal, GoPay users will be able to make payments to any merchant around the world that accepts PayPal. 
 This could give PayPal a huge boost, considering its main top-up options, credit card and bank accounts, isn’t that ubiquitous in Indonesia. An integration with GoPay would allow the company to tap into the large unbanked population in the country. 
 However, sources suggest that this kind of integration could become a subject of regulatory scrutiny, as it involves cross-border money transfers. Similar to Facebook, PayPal may not make Gojek its exclusive partner in Southeast Asia. In fact, Grab’s users can already use PayPal to pay for orders. 
 Gojek declined to disclose details about its upcoming integrations with Facebook and PayPal. 
 Southeast Asia a big question mark 
 While Facebook’s investment could prove to be a game changer for Gojek in Indonesia, it’s not clear how much of a bump the company will get in markets where it lags behind Grab. Catching up in those areas will require a huge capital investment. 
 Moving forward, we also don’t know how much emphasis Gojek will put on regional expansion or whether Facebook’s investment in the firm precludes it from backing similar companies that are active in the rest of Southeast Asia. A common opinion, even among people in the know, is that going abroad is not the main concern or strategy for Gojek. 
 While  The Ken   reports  that the Indonesian super app could be building remittance features with PayPal’s help, our view is that the move will strengthen its standing among Indonesian users but not for those overseas. 
 For Wallex’s Kiga, Indonesia will be the center of Gojek’s focus, at least for the foreseeable future.

 And yet, there’s an even simpler benefit for the Indonesian unicorn after it adds Facebook to its cap table: raising more money. 
 The social media company’s involvement is a strong positive signal for Gojek and Southeast Asia which could convince other investors to join in. “Other private equity [firms] may jump in like what happened in India [with Jio],” says an analyst at an investment bank. 
 After Jio received  a US$5.7 billion investment  from Facebook, investors like Silver Lake Partners, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, and KKR placed their bets on the company in the weeks that followed. 
 In Gojek’s case, it’s more likely that its existing private equity backers will top up their investments. Indeed, the Indonesian super app told  TechCrunch  that its series F fundraise is still “ongoing.” 
 If Gojek does raise more money, it might be tempting to think that it could finally mount a fight against Grab for the region. But the case isn’t that simple: There’s some indication that Facebook’s investment could cause a cascade. 
 After the social network’s investment in Jio, for instance, Amazon is now in talks to  acquire a stake  in the Indian firm’s rival, Bharti Airtel. 
 In Southeast Asia, Grab could use Gojek’s latest haul as a pitch to raise even more money. 
 While Amazon has  reportedly  bowed out of talks with Gojek, it could be enticed to finally place a bet on Southeast Asia. That will be a development worth watching.

648973,"Is Octopus’ launch on Apple Pay too little, too late?"," I spent a large chunk of my university days in the UK in a homesick haze. There was a lot I missed about Hong Kong: my family, the food, my friends, and the Octopus card. 
 Every time I fumbled for change in a store in London or dug through my pockets hoping I hadn’t lost my Tube ticket, I’d think about how much easier life was in Hong Kong with an Octopus card. With that one card, I could take a train, buy a drink, and pay for groceries – all without taking it out of my wallet. It felt like the future. 
 Now, Octopus has finally launched on Apple Pay. It should be a triumphant moment, bringing the ubiquitous card to Apple’s enormous base of users. But it comes as Hong Kong is starting to move on from the Octopus card. 
 
  From left: Octopus sales and marketing director Rita Li, CEO Sunny Cheung, and technical director Sammy Kam / Photo credit: Octopus 
 
 Launched in 1997, Octopus cards are smart cards that can be used on trains, ferries, and buses. They have a stored value that can also be used to pay in stores and restaurants. And it’s contactless, operating without the need to insert or swipe. 
 If this all sounds rather humdrum and commonplace now, that’s because it is. But twenty years ago, the idea that a single card could do all that – and do it without ever needing to come out of your wallet – was revolutionary. 
 The card quickly became essential in the city. The operator of the system claims that an astonishing 99% of people in Hong Kong aged between 16 and 65 use Octopus cards. It’s even used in some schools to take attendance. 
 Being able to use Octopus by waving your iPhone instead of waving a plastic card doesn’t sound like much of a change. But it does make a profound difference. Suica, a similar smart card in Japan, saw a sharp uptick in use when it launched on Apple Pay, according to Ata Distance. 
 But the numbers don’t match the experience, because I can tell you firsthand that using Suica on Apple Pay feels, well, magical. 
 I realize this is a bold claim for something so seemingly mundane, but I stand by it. Think about it: Odds are, your phone is already in your hand. You don’t need to unlock it, you don’t need to launch an app, you don’t need to do anything other than wave it towards the sensor. It’s so intuitive that even on short trips to Japan, it quickly became second nature to tap my phone and walk on without breaking stride. 
 Most importantly, it achieves the goal of any technology: it’s frictionless to the point of being practically invisible. 
 This is why so many clamored for Octopus to arrive on Apple Pay, which had been rumored for years and promised for months. But as the launch kept getting pushed back, other payment platforms made moves on the Octopus card’s turf. 
 The biggest? The MTR, Hong Kong’s subway system, said it’s teaming up with Alipay to install ticket gates that will add QR code-based payment as an option alongside Octopus. 
 (Abacus is a unit of the  South China Morning Post , which is owned by Alibaba, whose affiliate Ant Financial operates Alipay.) 
 QR codes have had an enormous impact on China. They play a hugely important role in the country, catapulting hundreds of millions of people into the digital payment age. 
 But they’re terrible for mass transport. 
 Time and again, issues emerge with QR code ticket gates. Even when they work properly, their very nature makes them slower than an NFC-based solution like Octopus. 
 Just look at the MTR’s own concept for how it might work: Launch the MTR app, tap the QR code button, and generate the code. Hold the code over the reader… and hope that you’ve aligned it correctly. 
 It’s staggering to think that Hong Kong is upgrading its subway in a way that will make it less efficient. But in a sense, it also shows how forward-thinking the Octopus card was; that technology from decades ago can still be competitive with more modern options. 
 The Octopus card once felt like the future. Maybe a new home on mobile will make it feel fresh again.

648950,Construction management startup Hubble nets $3.6m to expand in Southeast Asia,"  Hubble , a digital construction management startup, today announced that it has raised S$5 million (US$3.6 million) in a funding round led by Tin Men Capital, a VC firm focusing on business-to-business tech startups in Southeast Asia. 
 This is the Singapore-based startup’s first external investment since launching in 2016, Hubble said in a statement.

 Hubble’s software automates the entire range of construction processes on-site, covering the management of workforce, construction inputs (materials), equipment, and capital flows. 
 By deploying, tracking, optimizing, and automating the management of these four aspects via dashboards and apps, the solution could help contractors improve scheduling, resource deployment, productivity, quality, and safety, among others. 
 Hubble plans to use the funds to expand further outside of Singapore. It landed in Malaysia in January and plans to enter Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia next once travel restrictions are lifted. 
 Part of the new funds will also go toward product development to build additional modules that will be helpful for the industry in the post-Covid world, the company said. 
 According to McKinsey &amp; Company,  80%  of all construction work worldwide is still done on-site, but many developers and contractors are already looking into off-site ways to digitize the whole process. 
 In the city-state, another startup that wants to disrupt the construction industry is Wavemaker-backed Novade, which recently closed its  series B round  led by SIG and Vulcan Capital to accelerate its expansion in Europe, China, and Japan.

 With the announcement, Mubadala has become the latest investor in Jio, joining US-based companies Facebook, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, KKR, and General Atlantic. Jio’s total funding raised over the past couple of months has now reached US$11.5 billion. 
 Mubadala is a global investor with interests in multiple sectors such as aerospace, information and communications technology (ICT), healthcare, agribusiness, and real estate. Its US$229 billion portfolio currently spans five continents. It has offices in Brazil, Russia, and the US, as well as a joint venture in Hong Kong. 
 In a video announcing the deal, Mubadala’s CEO for aerospace, renewables, and ICT, Khaled Abdulla Al Qubaisi, said the move is in line with the company’s current ICT strategy and complements its other investments in telcos, satellite operations, data centers, and other ICT infrastructures. 
 Mubadala’s investment in Jio also further highlights the appeal of India’s massive internet market to foreign investors. 
 Yesterday, it was reported that Amazon is in discussions to buy a stake in Bharti Airtel worth at least  US$2 billion . Airtel is one of India’s largest telcos and a competitor of Reliance Jio, the top telco in the country. Another large player in the industry is Vodafone, which was also reportedly in talks with Google about a possible investment for a 5% stake.

648694,The battle of super-app giants in China,"  ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
 Mobile phones have become ubiquitous in China, where smartphone penetration grew in tandem with the proliferation of mobile internet. 
 Over the last decade, the country’s mobile internet-using population has grown fivefold. As of June 2019, there were more than  847 million  mobile internet users in China, accounting for over 99% of its netizens. In this environment, super apps have seen significant growth in terms of users and revenue. 
 Leading the market is WeChat, a social platform owned by Chinese gaming giant Tencent, with over 1 billion monthly active users (as of March 2020). Close contenders are Ant Financial’s mobile payment app Alipay and Tencent-backed Meituan-Dianping, which operates services ranging from food delivery to in-store dining and hotel booking. 
   
 
    
     
 
 As the market moves toward  cashless payments , companies are increasingly putting fintech capabilities at the forefront. In the third quarter of 2019, for instance, China saw  US$8.16 tril­lion  worth of third-party mobile payment transactions, according to data from iRe­search Con­sult­ing Group 
 Fintech and business services have become one of the main sources of revenue for Tencent as well, with a contribution of  22%  to the firm’s total revenue in 2019. WeChat Pay has also seen a boom in commercial transactions – clocking in  1 billion transactions  per day in Q4 2019. 
 In a market dominated by Alipay and Tenpay (Tencent’s PayPal-like platform), Meituan doesn’t want to miss the boat. In January, it launched  Maidan , its virtual credit card that can integrate with the company’s apps, as well as external partner platforms such as ticket-selling app Maoyan Entertainment. 
 
    
 
 But it’s not just Alipay and Meituan that have placed more emphasis on mini-programs amid the pandemic. WeChat, too, has been focusing on expanding its ecosystem. The chart above shows that the number of apps with MAUs larger than 1 million and 5 million soared in March. 
 
   ﻿   
     
 
 Mini-programs are apps that run within a larger app. From logistics, bike-sharing, ride-hailing, to ecommerce, users can essentially find and do anything in the form of mini-programs. Tencent, the pioneer of this format, is leading the race with  2 million  mini-programs in its roster. In 2019, it generated  US$115 billion  through these platforms, with average daily transaction volumes doubling year on year. 
 After WeChat’s success with mini-programs in 2018, Alipay rolled out its own version, aiming to help  40 million vendors  digitize their operations by enabling them to open mini-programs on its app. 
 While Meituan has also integrated the feature on its platform, the development is still in its early stages compared with other major players. 
    
  
    
     
 Launched in 2013, Meituan’s food delivery business has consistently dominated the market since 2015. Total revenues from the service have increased by 44.2% to 12.8 billion yuan (US$1.8 billion) as of Q2 2019, an impressive feat considering that it was also able to improve its gross margins by  6.5%  in the same time frame. 
 But 2020 hasn’t been a good year for food delivery services. With the pandemic dragging on, a lot of restaurants have either shut down or reduced operations, and Meituan’s food delivery business experienced an operating loss of  70.9 million yuan  (US$10 million) in Q1 2020. 
 On the other hand, Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial has plans to allow third-party vendors to offer services such as food delivery and hotel bookings on its Alipay mobile payment platform, expanding beyond its financial services focus. 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
 In recent years, Southeast Asia has become a hot topic owing to its  robust economic growth and high smartphone penetration . China is the perfect example for the region on how to utilize the growth of mobile internet users, and with Southeast Asia increasingly being  dominated by Chinese apps , it’s likely that we’ll see two or three super apps from the country enjoying the lion’s share of the region’s digital economy boom. 
 Grab and Gojek are the current leaders in Southeast Asia’s super app race. Who will be next?

648941,Healthtech startup Ubie bags $18.7m in series B money,"  Ubie , a Tokyo-based healthtech company, announced that it has secured US$18.7 million in a series B funding round from Suzuken, a Japanese pharmaceutical distributor. This follows the US$10.1 million Ubie raised in its previous funding rounds. 
 The company plans to use the new funds to expand its research and development capabilities, hire talent for sales and engineering roles, and scale its products.

 Founded in 2017 by Yoshinori Abe and Kota Kubo, Ubie operates AI Monshin, a software-as-a-service product for hospitals, and Ubie, an AI symptom checker app for individual users. 
 AI Monshin automatically asks medically relevant questions customized for each patient. It combines workflow-enhancing functions with clinical decision support to make medical record keeping more efficient. Ubie claims it could help diagnose 1,104 diseases and reduce interview time by around six minutes. 
 Meanwhile, its AI symptom checker could help users understand their symptoms better by answering questions from within an app. The startup officially released the service in April in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Ubie said it also looks to expand its presence in Asia in the near future. 
 Last year, the Asian healthtech sector saw nearly  US$5 billion in total funding across 340 deals , according to a report. China, India, and South Korea were the top three markets in terms of total deal value. Meanwhile, investments in Southeast Asia doubled to US$266 million.

648920,Amazon reportedly in talks to buy $2b stake in Indian telco Bharti Airtel," Amazon is in talks to buy a stake in Indian telecom company Bharti Airtel worth at least US$2 billion,  Reuters  reported, citing three people familiar with the development.

 Discussions between the two companies are currently in the early stages, two of the sources said, which means an agreement may not be reached. If the deal materializes, the ecommerce titan would be acquiring roughly a 5% stake in Bharti Airtel based on its current market value. 
 India is one of Amazon’s most important growth market. It has committed US$6.5 billion to expand its footprint in the country. During his visit to India earlier this year, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company’s plan to invest over  US$1 billion  to help digitize local small- and medium-sized businesses. 
 India is also one of the fastest-growing ecommerce markets globally. According to recent projections by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Indian software industry body Nasscom, ecommerce transactions are expected to hit US$150 billion in the next two years, up from US$84 billion in 2020. 
 Another company that looks to capitalize on this growth is Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). Through its ecommerce venture JioMart, the local conglomerate plans to digitize  kiranas , or small neighborhood stores, by making their products accessible online. 
 JioMart operates under Jio Platforms, RIL’s umbrella platform for its digital initiatives. Aside from JioMart, it also runs music-streaming service JioSaavn, online payments platform JioMoney, and the largest telco in India, Reliance Jio. 
 Over the last couple of months, Jio has been racking up billions of dollars in investments from global institutions. Its biggest one so far is Facebook’s US$5.7 billion commitment in exchange for nearly 10% of the company. 
  See:  Why is Facebook betting $5.7b on Reliance?   
 Prior to the deal’s announcement, it was being reported that Jio and the social media leader were in talks to build their own super app, combining features such as social, digital payments, and gaming. 
 RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani later revealed Jio’s collaboration with Facebook-owned WhatsApp to help  kiranas  accept digital payments. 
 JioMart has since piloted a service that lets consumers place orders from local grocers straight from the messaging app. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(2, 0.99947345)]","['app', 'Reliance', 'Facebook', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers', 'RIL', 'Nasscom', 'WhatsApp', 'Amazon', 'JioMart', 'Reuters']",['India']
648882,Grab to double down on GrabMart as Covid-19 boosts deliveries,"  Grab  said it has expanded its daily essentials and grocery delivery service into eight countries in Southeast Asia amid the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Over the last three months, Grab has rolled out GrabMart in 50 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar, and Cambodia.

 GrabMart is an on-demand delivery service that helps users buy consumer goods such as groceries, home essentials, health and beauty items, and gifts, among others. It also serves as a new channel for Grab’s merchant partners to reach more consumers online. 
 Grab said it has partnered with over 3,000 stores, including supermarkets and convenience stores, to date. 
 It will continue to double down on expanding its GrabMart service to continue supporting consumers’ shopping needs in the post-pandemic era. 
 “Covid-19 has accelerated the adoption of on-demand delivery services across Southeast Asia,” Demi Yu, regional head of GrabFood and GrabMart, said. “In a post-Covid-19 normal, we anticipate demand for delivery services to remain elevated.” 
 Last month, Grab’s group CEO and founder Anthony Tan said that Grab has seen a  sharp decline  in its ride-hailing business, with volumes in some markets down by double-digit percentages. However, its online food and grocery delivery business has seen increased demand as people stay at home during the pandemic. 
 According to some reports, Southeast Asia’s online grocery market is expected to reach  US$309 billion  by 2021. Grab’s archrival Gojek has also expanded its GoFood service to let users purchase grocery items and have them delivered to their homes during the lockdown. 
 In India, food delivery unicorn Swiggy also expanded its services to deliver groceries and essentials to over 125 cities. Restaurant discovery app Zomato has also started delivering groceries in more than 80 cities in the country.

 Founded in 2017, LingoAce helps students aged between six and 15 to learn Mandarin online. With nearly 1,000 native speakers teaching from China, the platform now serves more than 10,000 students across Asia, North America, and Europe, the company said. 
 The new funds will be used to expand its operations in Southeast Asia, starting with Indonesia, considering the population and the gap between demand and supply in the archipelago. The startup noted that it has already reached a few customers in Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia as well through its office in Singapore. LingoAce also operates in Beijing, Wuhan, and Los Angeles. 
 Some established names in the online language learning space include the likes of US-based Duolingo, which has almost US$150 million in total funding, according to Crunchbase. There’s also London-based Busuu. 
 Compared with other players, LingoAce CEO and founder Hugh Yao said, “Our key differentiation is that we are closer to the market to develop and execute appropriate product strategy, while keeping strong supply operation (on the teacher side) in China at same time.” 
 Looking ahead, the company will leverage emerging technologies such as AI, augmented reality, and virtual reality as it sees an uptick in online learning adoption amid the pandemic. Yao said the company saw its revenue grow by more than 4x from January to May.

648840,Are you in the Grab or Gojek camp?," Dear readers, 
 A couple of months ago, Grab  raised $850 million . And just yesterday,  Facebook and PayPal  announced that they’re injecting cash into Gojek, marking the social network giant’s first investment in an Indonesia-based startup.

 With the new investments announced, we thought it would be nice to  update this visualization . You can zoom in and out of the chart as well as click on specific funding rounds and the names of individual investors. For now, please have a look at this: 
   
 What the graph shows is that with the  exception of Visa , investors are either siding with Gojek or Grab. It’s hard to have a foot in both camps, and that’s perfectly normal behavior. 
 If you zoom in closer, you can see a SoftBank vs. Google-Tencent skirmish happening. The Tencent camp also includes other Chinese tech giants Meituan-Dianping and JD.com. However, I’m not the first to point this out:  Tech in Asia  guest writer Jessica Chang made this observation  two years ago . 
 Picking one side over the other has a trickle-down effect, too. For example, you may receive friendly messages from the other camp saying how disappointed they are in your choices. Again, I guess that’s bound to happen as the competition heats up. It highlights how fierce the Grab-Gojek rivalry is and that the tension does make  a merger  between the two seem impossible. If that’s the case, then may the best team win.

648632,The leadership practices that helped us survive as business ground to a halt," In the past two months, a lot has changed for Pathao. Overnight, our rides business dropped to zero and food orders went down by more than half. To extend our runway, we had to conduct salary cuts as big as 80%, and nearly all marketing spending were put on hold.

 In this situation, it’s expected for company morale to hit rock bottom. But somehow, that hasn’t been the case for us. In fact, in the last few months, the team has launched five new product verticals, which together make up 70% of our current revenue. 
 Here are the leadership practices that helped us cope with and survive the downturn. 
 The lockdown 
 To curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus, Bangladesh imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25, which was initially set for a couple of weeks. But after monitoring other markets, we anticipated that it would last for much longer and that recovery wouldn’t be immediate. 
 The reality turned out to be largely in line with our predictions: Our rides business, which represents a sizable portion of our transaction volume, was at a complete standstill. Food orders were down by 70% in the first week alone. 
 We knew that our balance sheet would become hugely lopsided, but we didn’t know for how long. We needed to take action to preserve cash and extend our runway. 
 Prior to the pandemic, the company had already been running promotions to grow its food business. But when the crisis hit, we immediately cut marketing spending – though not all of it. It was still a means for gaining market share, and we didn’t want to rule that out. 
 That left us with the elephant in the room: payroll expenses. 
 Salaries were our biggest operating expense, which is both good and bad news: Good news because it’s within our locus of control, but bad news since it meant tough decisions and sacrifices. 
 Here are some of the actions we took that worked for us. 
 1. Acting early and being decisive 
 Two weeks into the lockdown, we announced the implementation of progressive pay cuts throughout the company. 
 This meant that the hardest hit would be those with higher salaries so that lower-paid employees would be protected and job cuts could be avoided. 
 We were already running a lean team when the lockdown was imposed, after reducing our headcount by 50% over the past year; we didn’t think that layoffs would be productive. 
 Proactively cutting down payroll costs for the next six months seemed aggressive, but preserving cash was crucial for survival, and we were transparent about this with our team. 
 2. Telling the truth 
 In difficult situations, people instinctively tend to show false optimism and shy away from reality. But doing this would have led us astray and prevented us from making contingency plans or taking bold actions. 
 Instead, we aimed to be transparent and explained in detail how we were going to get through this crisis and what that meant for each team member. 
 When we  addressed the company , we were upfront in admitting that we didn’t know how drastic or prolonged the effects of the pandemic would be. Our chief financial officer started by saying, “We are asking all of you to make a personal sacrifice.” It wasn’t a rosy beginning, but it was direct and called on everyone’s sense of responsibility. 
 The decisions were then outlined to the team: 
 
 C-suite executives would be on zero pay to show that we practice what we preach and foster a feeling of shared sacrifice. 
 Progressive pay cuts would be enacted for the next six months so that the lowest-paid employees would be the least affected. 
 Festival bonuses, which range from 50% to 100% of employees’ salaries, would be taken out, even though the Eid holidays are a big deal in our country. 
 
 When we announced these in April, we were among the earlier ones to do so in the ecosystem and in the country. We faced criticism, mostly from parties outside the company, and people questioned if we were going out of business. 
 After we had addressed the staff collectively, the conversation cascaded into team and one-on-one employee chats. Our CEO kept open hours to talk with anyone. Nothing was off the table. 
 3. Charting a course, creating purpose 
 It wasn’t only our finances that needed to reflect changing realities. We also needed to adapt what we were building. 
 So we asked ourselves three questions: What services will our customers need? How are they spending their time and money during the lockdown? What are the problems we can solve for them? 
 Based on this, and our assumption that recovery will take time, we changed our product roadmaps. Some features and products were accelerated while some were put on the back burner. 
 Next, we set goals for each product: How many transactions did we want to achieve? How much revenue did we want to earn? In how many days? This brought people together to work toward a common goal. 
 4. Forging partnerships, building momentum 
 For Pathao, the crisis produced an urgency and a momentum to get things done much faster. Deals that would have taken months to finish were negotiated in hours and executed in days. 
 And instead of building everything ourselves, we made strategic partnerships that helped us move fast and gave us access to the expertise that our partners possessed. 
 For example, we built Pathao Health, a new tool to connect people to health resources, in collaboration with partner organizations who were in a better position to provide quality content and better telemedicine services than we could have built ourselves. 
 And these partnerships aren’t relegated to just business deals; they involve technical integrations as well. 
 The truth is that in normal, predictable times, leadership is not that critical; the quality of the systems in place is more important. But in a crisis, even the strongest organizational habits, structures, and resources prove inadequate to meet new challenges. In these circumstances, strong leadership is crucial.

  SBI Kejora Orbit Fund I  will invest between US$200,000 and US$3 million per ticket size in areas such as supply chain, education, medicine, consumer goods and retail, agriculture, fintech, and digital media. 
 It’s expected to hit its first close on June 30. According to a statement, confirmed investors include family offices, high-net-worth individuals, corporations, and other institutional investors across Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, and Europe. 
 The new fund is the successor of Kejora Star Capital II, Kejora’s early-stage investment vehicle launched in 2016. With US$380 million assets under management, the Indonesia-based VC firm invests from early stage to growth stage. It has 35 portfolio companies across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, South Korea, and Hong Kong. 
 The joint fund also marks SBI’s first fund focusing solely on Indonesia. The company’s previous investments in the archipelago include ecommerce unicorn Tokopedia, fintech firm Investree, business-to-business marketplace Ralali, and peer-to-peer lending firms Amartha and Taralite. 
 The Orbit Fund will be led by Billy Boen and Shunichi Keida, along with Leon John Hermann, Yudi Anugrah, and Richie Wirjan. 
 Last year, Indonesia saw at least 110 funding transactions, with total funding raised amounting to nearly  US$3 billion  from 60 disclosed investments. Sectors such as finance, software as a service, ecommerce, and logistics secured the biggest number of transactions, according to a report.

 Before the company achieved this level of visibility, however, its co-founder and CEO Shashank Dixit had to walk the typical founder’s path first. During the startup’s early days, to save cost, he’d sleep at the Singapore Changi Airport after a day of knocking on doors and selling software. 
 Deskera has since drawn prominent investors like Tembusu Holdings, Naver, and Jungle Ventures, and a large backlit company logo now greets visitors in its Singapore headquarters. Over the years, the India-born Dixit has even come to call the country home.

 But even with its high profile, the firm wants to shake things up. Beyond opening a new office and applying a fresh coat of paint, the company is undergoing the biggest overhaul in its 12-year history. 
 The changes are aimed at resolving some of the persistent complaints from customers about its software and from ex-employees about the company’s work culture. 
 They’re also aimed at attracting a new generation of smartphone-wielding business owners who would have never picked up Deskera’s software. “There’s a tectonic shift” happening,  as Dixit has put it . 
 I’m sick of people taunting us. 
 Indeed, the changes – which began before the CEO declared his intention to seek a unicorn-level valuation as part of the startup’s series B fundraise – have shaken up the organization. 
 Deskera has laid off dozens of product and engineering staffers in India and is rebuilding part of the team in Singapore. It is also tweaking its distribution model and sunsetting its flagship products. 
 “We have to be on par with the best software – the Xeros and the Quickbooks. I’m sick of people taunting us because our software doesn’t look good,” Dixit tells  Tech in Asia  in an exclusive interview. 
 
  The new Deskera app / Image credit: Deskera 
 
 In fact, the company has written a new Deskera app from scratch using a new technology stack and is selling it under a new pricing scheme. This strategy is seeing some success: The new app has acquired around 75,000 monthly active users about eight months after it was launched. 
 In several conversations with  Tech in Asia , Dixit has said that drastic changes are par for the course even among successful enterprise software firms. He believes that while the startup has its share of unhappy customers, its client base, on the whole, has been satisfied with its products. 
 The cost of growth 
 Deskera, which develops cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, has seen blistering growth: Its revenue more than doubled to US$68 million in the financial year 2017, Dixit  has told the media . 
 He now adds that the firm has since surpassed that figure, with 10% to 20% of its income coming from services. 
    
 Recently, the firm sold thousands of licenses to one enterprise customer under a white-label contract worth millions of US dollars, though a confidentiality agreement prohibits Dixit from disclosing the client’s identity. 
 In this arrangement, the enterprise would sell a software bundle containing its own products and Deskera’s – minus the brand name – to end-users. 
 Customers obtained through this deal won’t count under Deskera’s user numbers, though, as they technically belong to the enterprise. 
 More such partnerships have been in the works. However,  Tech in Asia ’s interviews with over 20 ex- and current staff, customers, and competitors reveal that the company’s pursuit of growth came at a price. 
 
  Deskera’s Pune office / Photo credit: Deskera 
 
 Deskera’s product and engineering team in India struggled over the years to deliver on the lofty expectations the company and its partners set when pitching to clients. Its software was limited when it came to configuring the customers’ needs. Instead, customizations for each geography had to be hardcoded, making the software hard to maintain and bug-ridden, claims an ex-employee. 
 The team had to meet “unrealistic deadlines,” says an ex-staff. “Something that would have taken ideally one month to develop was ordered to be completed in two weeks.” This caused customers to complain about features that didn’t work or were missing. 
 Part of the problem was Deskera’s tendency to hire en masse smart but inexperienced fresh graduates in India, and sources say the low pay and long hours affected company morale as well. Fresh graduates were asked to work even on Saturdays. 
 Employees also had to deposit a sum of money as part of a two- or three-year bond – a  common but not necessarily effective  practice among software companies in India. Appraisals were given late, which would then delay salary increments. 
 Sales promises 
 When it came to acquiring customers, Dixit says Deskera relied heavily on a network of tens of thousands of partners. Most of its sales and implementation were made through this network, and its tie-up with major software distribution platform Ingram Micro accounted for 25,000 of those partners, the CEO claims. 
 As the sales team hustled for deals, potential customers were promised features that were not yet built and, in many cases, an implementation period (when the software is integrated into the organization) of no more than three months. 
 These promises were sometimes not kept. “We signed up four years ago, paid 100% upfront, and it’s still not fully implemented and cannot do half of what was promised,” says a small-business owner who purchased the product. Another customer used the software for eight months before eventually asking for a refund.

 Another issue was how a large number of customers in Singapore had used a government grant – available between 2010 and 2018 – to defray the purchase of Deskera software. A number of them didn’t really need it but couldn’t resist taking advantage of the grant’s lax approval process, claims an ex-sales staff. 
 Dixit, however, says clients are mostly happy with the software. He cites an internal survey conducted among a random sample of customers in October 2019 by business consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan, which says clients gave the software an average score of 4.08 out of 5. Frost &amp; Sullivan called it “a highly positive rating,” he shares. 
 A cafe franchise, which still uses the software today, tells  Tech in Asia  that it has spent a five-digit US dollar sum on the system (half of it subsidized by the grant) and has had an overall positive experience with it. 
 “During the first six months, there were some teething problems and bugs [but] things got better after the first year. Service was good and quite prompt,” says the business owner. 
 “It got very personal.” 
 Deskera also battled complaints from employees in Singapore. Common themes emerged among ex-staff between 2015 and 2020, and a spate of resignations toward the end of 2019 and at the beginning of this year occurred for various reasons. 
 Even though employees in Singapore were well-paid, some were not happy at how managers had treated them. 
 A few complaints centered around the micromanagement of lunch hours. One employee, for instance, was reprimanded for being out for longer than an hour, even though it was for a meeting with a potential partner. “There’s a lack of trust,” the person says. 
 Several ex-staff were also berated in front of the whole office for returning from lunch a bit later than the allotted time – never mind that it was during a slow season. “It got very personal, and we couldn’t tolerate that kind of behavior,” the person recalls. 
 Sources further complained about a manager who would deny leave applications despite an employee having a valid reason, and how non-sales staff was made to do cold calls to offer free software licenses. The latter practice, however, isn’t uncommon in the startup world. 
 At times, employees weren’t given clear instructions. With departments working in silos, orders from different managers were often conflicting.

 Dixit concedes there were some acrimonious departures due to disagreements over employee stock options, but he claims that the people who left were junior staff whose departures were not a blow to the company. He chalks up the conflicts to Deskera’s fast growth – it doubled its headcount in the past 12 months – which led to new hires that felt like a “cultural or ambition mismatch.” 
 “I know that we don’t get all things right all the time, and I am sorry that occasionally this leads to disappointments,” he says. “We will take steps to ensure this does not happen again.” 
 Some ex-staff, however, enjoyed their stints at the company. “It really depends on the boss you get,” says someone who worked out of its Singapore office. 
 “Given a chance, I’d be pleased to be a part of it again,” says a marketer who worked in the company’s Pune, India office. 
 A blessing and a curse 
 Deskera’s issues aren’t unique. Like its peers, the startup makes most of its money through “channel partners,” Dixit explains, and it’s a dominant model among enterprise software companies. 
 With this business model, Deskera’s partners take a 25% cut on each sale. If they provide add-on services such as implementation or customer service, they take a bigger commission. 
 If they build their own features on top of the software, they get to charge – and keep – a markup on top of the base pricing. 
 The approach allows companies like Deskera to access the market without having to invest in a large headcount, Dixit adds. 
 We’re not getting a good look at customers. 
 Partner aggregators like Ingram Micro also serve as middlemen who process and collect payments on behalf of the software provider. This is a necessity, given that there’s “low credit card usage for business-to-business transactions, even in Singapore,” explains Dixit; only  2% of the population  in India, which is Deskera’s biggest market by client base, owns a credit card. 
 But the method brings its own headaches. For one, Dixit claims that Deskera has little control over what the channel partners say or do, contributing to the complaints. 
 The company also has limited data on its sales process and clients. “My problem is not revenue. My problem is not growth. My problem is that I can’t control it. And as a SaaS company, we’re not getting a good look at customers.” 
 Every ERP software firm – even giants like SAP, Oracle, and Netsuite – faces the same challenges as a result of their reliance on channel partners, who are often “interested in making money, [but are] not interested in improving the product or improving the support,” Dixit says.

 Deskera’s business has its inherent limitations as well. “ERP software is just bad generally,” says a former manager at a major Silicon Valley firm who now runs a startup. “They’re often bulky and not user-friendly. Any time you might save [from using one] is spent wrestling with the software.” 
 In her current stint, she prefers specialized software such as Xero for accounting and Zoho for sales. While she thinks an ERP software would make more sense once a company reaches over 150 people or US$20 million in annual revenue, she still prefers to “buy function-specific tools and have them all integrate with each other via an API.” 
 Even large tech companies struggle with off-the-shelf ERP software, with many opting to build their own, she says. “If I’m a tech company, why would I trust SAP or Oracle over my own engineers?” 
 The hardware manufacturing firm she used to work for managed its supply chain with both spreadsheets and ERP software. “For every transaction that was recorded in our ERP system, I feel like two more happened outside of it,” she recalls. 
 Similarly, a businessman operating ecommerce and retail stores tells  Tech in Asia  that he relies on spreadsheets and offline software to manage store operations, and finds switching to ERP software costly due to the complexity of data migration. 
 These concerns would mean that Deskera has a growth ceiling since it specializes in serving small and medium-sized enterprises. Dixit himself says that his company’s software best suits firms that manage inventory, such as retail and food businesses. 
 He acknowledges that Deskera can do better, and addressing these issues would require nothing less than an extensive overhaul. 
 Beyond cosmetic surgery 
 As a first step, the company has rebuilt part of its engineering and product team in Singapore, which meant laying off dozens of employees in India. 
 While India is famous for producing  strong enterprise software firms , Deskera believes it will have an easier time building a product and engineering team that can create world-class software in Singapore, says a source familiar with the deliberations. 
 Dixit  has previously explained  that the country “offers some niche technology abilities. Singapore developers are advanced when it comes to creating high-valued, non-commoditized stuff.”

 The move was also made to bring the core intellectual property closer to management, which sits in Singapore. The island-state serves as an ideal “lab for SME innovation” due to the sheer number of small businesses that are reachable within a short travel time, the CEO tells  Tech in Asia . 
 But rebuilding the engineering team proved to be a messy task, and one employee in India found himself receiving the short end of the stick. 
 As the company whittled down its India team amid the pandemic-induced lockdown, he thought of seeking another job in case he would get laid off next, but a promise of a transfer to Singapore made him stay put. 
 It didn’t happen in the end, though. “We don’t have any work for you,” the employee was told.

 The reality was that Deskera was rewriting its ERP software using different programming languages. 
 From Java, it shifted to Go. Instead of using iOS’s and Android’s respective native languages, which had caused problems with app notifications, it switched to React Native, which works across platforms. 
 “We had to let go of people who weren’t trained on the new stack,” Dixit says. 
 The company was also seeking engineers who could do more than write code. “If you can’t tell your story, [if] you can’t communicate what you do, then maybe you’re not the right engineer for us,” the CEO says. As such, Deskera’s engineering team now maintains a  blog . 
 The new app, which launched in October 2019, looks modern – a vast departure from the old version’s Windows-era aesthetic. 
 
  Deskera’s old web interface 
 
 On the business front, Deskera is reducing its reliance on channel partners and aims to sell 50% of its software through direct sales. Channels will still be involved, but their role will be restricted to sales. 
 While the move seems drastic, Dixit says it’s pretty common among successful enterprise software firms. 
 Zoho, for example,  went through two transformations  before becoming a software-as-a-service company. Jira, the popular bug tracking software by Atlassian, began as a downloadable program before it moved to the cloud. 
 
  Deskera’s new web interface 
 
 Dixit believes the time is ripe for Deskera to change. Its partnership model is a remnant of a past when enterprises primarily shopped for software by making phone calls. “That supply chain is vanishing” as more businesses buy software online now, he says. 
 Another trend that the company wants to capitalize on is e-wallet payments, which is  surpassing credit card transactions  in India. Dixit believes this trend will make it feasible for software makers to sell directly to Indian businesses, who now have a convenient means to pay. 
 To ride on the rising wave of tech-savvy business owners, Deskera is doing something it’s never done before: Offering its mobile ERP app for free to one user per company, forever. Businesses that want to grant more employees access to the app will need to pay a fee. 
 The goal of the new app is to allow people to run their businesses entirely on their phones. Dixit says there’s never been a mobile customer relationship management or ERP app as complete as Deskera’s. Aside from tracking customers, expenses, invoices, and claims, the platform also has a chat feature and will soon launch a marketplace where businesses can buy and sell supplies. 
   
 Users have created 1.5 million invoices through the app between January and May this year, Dixit reveals. That’s about eight invoices per user, most of whom come from India. If the company can bring 10% of those users onto its US$468 a year plan, that will mean an extra US$8.8 million in revenue. 
 But while the new app appears to be drawing plenty of new customers, migrating old ones over will be tricky. With much of the friction found in data transfer, the company is exploring using machine learning as a means to automate this process. 
 Unicorn hype 
 With its new vision, Deskera sought “a valuation in the unicorn range,” the CEO  previously told   Tech in Asia , adding that it had received a term sheet that brought it close to that market value. 
 While Dixit confirms receiving multiple offers, he maintains that he wasn’t planning to move forward with any of them. 
 “There was no serious investment discussion. There was no banker involved,” he now says. “We wanted to obviously talk about being a unicorn, but there was nothing serious.” 
 Instead, it was more of a “dipstick survey” to gauge how the market valued Deskera, which then became “overblown” into a funding round, he claims. 
 We’re all partners in this crime. 
 Dixit says his company doesn’t need more investment money. “If you’re an entrepreneur, I’ll tell you not to raise capital,” he said last year at a  DealStreetAsia  event attended by fund managers. 
 For enterprise software firms, he believes it’s better to let the customers be their investors. In Deskera’s case, the company raised a series A round only in 2018, a decade after its founding, and Dixit says a large part of that round went toward paying back earlier backers. 
 At the panel, he lamented a culture where private “soonicorns” and unicorns are held up as heroes. He also declared paper valuations as the worst measure of respect. 
    
 “We’re all partners in this crime” of pumping up valuations, he told the room. The media “won’t even write my story if I say I’m not a unicorn, so I have to start with, ’Oh, I’m going to be a unicorn’ […] People won’t read this news unless it’s about a unicorn.” 
 For him, the true measure of a company’s worth is a public listing. And even though his first attempt in 2016 didn’t pan out, this goal is still in his sights. 
 “If you do an IPO, you get a million people to agree on your value [and] that’s your value,” he says. “Anything else is just paper money.” ",Terence Lee,0,14,"[(0, 0.57699996), (2, 0.20329808), (3, 0.21968827)]","['Dixit', 'Oracle', 'app', 'SaaS', 'Netsuite', 'ERP', 'Java', 'SAP', 'Xeros', 'Pune', 'Channels', 'Deskera']","['US', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'Naver', 'India', 'Xero', 'Tech', 'Atlassian', 'Deskera']"

  The Finder  provides expats with tips, ideas, and inspiration for what to do and buy and where to go in Singapore and around the region. It has more than 300,000 “global-local” users and is circulated in more than 400 locations, according to a statement. 
 Following the acquisition, Moovaz will be taking over the publication’s assets including its quarterly print and digital magazines, The Finder Kids supplements, web content, and social media content, among others, in Singapore and Malaysia. 
 Moovaz said the deal will help the magazine reach its relocation clients and build an ecosystem of end-to-end logistics and lifestyle services. At the same time, the startup looks to cater to global-locals as they relocate and settle into local communities. 
 As part of the transaction, the magazine’s editor-in-chief Sara Lyle Bow will be joining Moovaz as director of  The Finder  and head of community. SPH will also become a Moovaz shareholder and help with the startup’s regional outreach efforts via its media platforms, according to the statement. 
 Founded in 2017, Moovaz aims to offer transparency and open access to mobility services worldwide. The company said it currently has a global network of more than 2,000 certified partners. 
 The acquisition comes after Moovaz raised  US$7 million  in a series A funding round led by Quest Ventures in April. It previously secured  US$1 million  in seed funding from Mojo Partners in 2018, followed by  an undisclosed amount of investment  from Hustle Fund and two former 500 Startups partners last year.

642299,Grab and Gojek’s investors visualized on an interactive network graph,"    
 ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
  This chart is interactive. You can pan, zoom in and out, and view specific data points.  
 Southeast Asia’s super-app giants have been slugging it out in several verticals, from ride-hailing to food delivery to mobile wallets. They’ve also been competing to attract investors to fund their frenzied expansion plans. 
 This chart features the existing shareholders of Grab and Gojek. Even though the two companies have grown in scale, both are still in the red. Their financial backers are waiting for the day when these archrivals become profitable and enable investors to realize the value of their investments through a public listing. 
 At the same time, both firms have attracted a bevy of strategic investors who aren’t just in it for pure financial returns. 
 One such backer – Visa – is actually  betting on both . After all, the growth potential of their core ride-hailing business is huge. While the number of ride-hailing users in Southeast Asia soared from 8 million active users in 2015 to 40 million in 2019, these consumers represented just 6% of the region’s population, according to a recent report from Google, Bain &amp; Company, and Temasek. 
 More recently, Facebook and Paypal have jumped into the ring by  investing in Gojek  to boost their presence in Indonesia. 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
 The sheer growth potential of Grab and Gojek has catapulted the companies to dizzying valuations of US$14 billion and US$9.5 billion, respectively. 
 While that’s a remarkable achievement, it will be harder for both to justify such lofty numbers if they remain in the red. 
 With the general appetite for injecting fresh capital waning among venture capital and private equity firms amid the economic uncertainties brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s crucial for startups to show existing and would-be investors that they can minimize cash burn and reach profitability soon.

648711,Stamping out counterfeits from Vietnam’s ecommerce space," It’s a regular day in Hanoi. A lady clad in designer pieces from head to toe steps out onto the street. She slings a Chanel bag over her shoulder, and its chain strap clinks against her Gucci belt. She puts her Dior sunglasses away, dons her helmet, and climbs on her Vespa scooter, kicking off with her Nike shoes. 
 Pretty impressive? Take a closer look, and maybe you’ll realize something else: These could all just be replicas. 
 In 2018, counterfeiting cost the world economy  US$323 billion . And in a place like Vietnam, where everyday items like electronics, clothes, and even health products could turn out to be bogus, the impact is in the  billions . 
 This calls into question consumer safety. At home, faulty electronics could explode. In factories and on the road, fake parts could become damaged more quickly, resulting in potentially dangerous malfunctions. 
 Vietnam’s geographical proximity to China, the world’s  largest  counterfeit hub, means that such goods can be smuggled into its warehouses, repackaged as legitimate products, and then shipped to international markets. The country is also a major transit hub to the rest of Southeast Asia by land, air, and sea.

 A counterfeiting culture 
 A lack of systematic enforcement and low penalties have exacerbated Vietnam’s counterfeit culture. 
  Businesses  often shy away from reporting counterfeiting cases to authorities, believing that doing so would reduce consumer trust in their brand and lessen sales. 
 Vietnamese consumers themselves are price-sensitive and indifferent to  authenticity , so it’s unlikely they would report fakes either. 
 But this reluctance isn’t the only concern about this illegal practice. 
 Shady businesses often operate online or have false addresses, making it  more difficult  for local authorities to track them down. And the rise of ecommerce marketplaces, which offer counterfeiters such low barriers to entry, pose another challenge for regulators. 
 In order to address the proliferation of sham goods, these parties need to work together. 
 How Sendo detects counterfeits 
 “Technology is a solution for this issue,” says Nguyen Phuong Hoang, CTO and co-founder of Vietnam-based ecommerce firm  Sendo . 
 The company has developed a comprehensive system to weed out fraudsters at scale and has formed a team dedicated to this effort. These anti-counterfeit specialists and AI and data science experts help recognize new cheating formats and enforce policies. 
 For instance, retailers on SenMall, Sendo’s marketplace for branded products, have to pass a stringent screening process for their business license and certificates of product origin and distribution. This allows the company to establish a business’s legitimacy and the source of its goods. 
 “Our system automatically scans and checks the information, then alerts us in the case of any unclear product origins,” says Nguyen. 
 Artificial intelligence is essential to the firm’s anti-counterfeiting process. 
 The Sendo marketplace has millions of active products listed by hundreds of thousands of merchants. Bad-faith sellers attempt to bypass the monitoring process by using product photos with small logos from different angles and a host of keyword variants in product descriptions. Monitoring the entire system manually is virtually impossible. 
 “We have developed a holistic counterfeit monitoring system based on state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing and computer vision,” explains Nguyen. The system is capable of automatically recognizing product images that contain banned brand logos as well as analyzing and detecting possible variants of prohibited keywords in product descriptions. 
 Sendo’s AI models are robust, having been trained on “hundreds of thousands” of product images and descriptive texts on its marketplace, notes Nguyen. 
 For instance, the machine can detect the minor differences between the different spellings of popular Japanese personal care brand Shiseido – such as “Shiseidoo,” “Shiiseido,” or “Shi sei do” – in multiple contexts. 
 A team of experts also conducts continuous control over categories that are at higher risk of fraud. These specialists possess experience and knowledge about the authentic goods being sold and regularly check product features, appearances, and prices.

 Man and machine join forces 
 Sendo’s proprietary technology and operations has helped purge counterfeit items and encourage positive growth. 
 In 2019, the firm says it prevented thousands of trade fraud and intellectual property violations on its platform. As Nguyen points out, “90% of counterfeit items have been detected and prevented by our engines.” 
 In recognition of its efforts, the company was the only local Vietnamese ecommerce representative to receive the International Anti-Counterfeiting Association  certificate  for its contribution to brand protection and seller support as well as cooperation with retailers. 
 Sendo is currently educating Vietnamese consumers through its work with the country’s Ministry of Industry and Trade in the entity’s anti-counterfeiting campaign. 
 Further developments 
 Moving forward, Sendo will continue to invest in research and development to stay one step ahead of counterfeiters’ evolving tactics. 
 On top of improving the existing recognition and detection system, the firm’s AI research team is looking into the early detection of bad sellers, relying on big data to collect seller data and assess their past and current activities. 
 As the Vietnamese ecommerce market evolves, higher-quality products are more available online and customer needs have become more sophisticated. Manufacturers, distributors, and certified sellers of branded goods are now more willing to sell online as well. 
 Being a pioneer in the Vietnamese ecommerce scene has positioned Sendo as  a potential future unicorn . To fulfil that potential, the company constantly strives to assure users of product authenticity and quality. 
 Sendo is poised to capture growth sustainably, feeding authentic sellers with revenue while weeding out damaging counterfeiters.

648742,Grab launches digital payments card in the Philippines," Singapore-based ride-hailing giant  Grab  today launched its digital-first prepaid card in the Philippines under its existing partnership with Mastercard. 
 
  Image credit: Grab 
 
 Regulated by the central bank of the Philippines (BSP), the GrabPay digital card can be used to make purchases online, pay for digital subscriptions, and make local and global transactions. It expands Grab’s online merchant ecosystem, adding support for global vendors that accept Mastercard cards. 
 The GrabPay card was first  launched in Singapore  in December last year. 
  In 2018 , Grab and Mastercard formed a partnership to play into Southeast Asia’s increasing adoption of cashless payment options and support the region’s underbanked and unbanked individuals. 
 According to a survey conducted in April by Mastercard in the Philippines, roughly 40% of Filipino consumers are now using contactless payments more often in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Citing data from BSP, local media  Philstar  reported that a total of 8.4 million transactions cumulatively worth 43.4 billion pesos (US$865 million) were coursed through the central bank’s money transfer facility from April 1 through April 24 this year. The transaction volume already exceeded the 6.8 million posted in the month prior. 
 “As cities slowly get back on their feet after months of lockdown brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, digital payments become the critical enabler to embrace this new reality,” said GrabPay Philippines head Jonny Bates. 
 The Philippines’ Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is pushing to mandate cashless payments for taxis and transport network vehicle services like Grab as Metro Manila eases into a new normal. 
 The LTFRB chair said that the need to go cashless in the transportation industry has become urgent as the government continues to strive to mitigate the spread of the virus. 
 In 2015, the country  began promoting  the adoption of cashless payments. The initiative, which was part of a bilateral agreement between the Philippine and US governments, aims to turn the country into a “cash-lite” economy within 20 years.

648729,SenseTime’s AI makes sure you park your shared bike properly," One of China’s largest facial recognition companies wants to provide a high-tech solution to a problem triggered by a tech bubble that’s bursting: scores of leftover shared bicycles littering the streets of China’s cities. 
  SenseTime  introduced an “intelligent patrol screen” last Friday that uses computer vision and an abundance of cameras to detect whether people park their bikes properly. But it’s about more than just bikes. It can detect if there’s garbage on the streets or whether a crowd is gathering and alert city managers. 
 
  SenseTime’s Hong Kong office / Photo credit: SenseTime 
 
 The new system currently covers an area in Shanghai along Jiangsu Road, which has been dotted with a whopping 630 cameras. The purpose, according to the company, is to save time – Shanghai is home to nearly 25 million people and has an urban grid-style management system that requires a lot of staff to survey. 
 The system is based on SenseFoundry, a computer vision analysis platform for city security management. Among the platform’s many functions are face and vehicle recognition. 
 SenseTime plans to add even more features in the future. The watchful eye of the company’s AI will be able to detect water accumulation on the streets, street peddlers, illegal parking, and something called “disorderly drying,” which the company told us refers to people hanging their clothes out to dry in the wrong place. 
 To create the system, SenseTime had to solve some interesting technological obstacles. For a traditional computer vision algorithm, a dense group of bicycles may look confusing due to their different sizes and positions. The same is true of trash. It can show up as all kinds of shapes and sizes, unlike conventional targets of computer recognition like vehicles, human bodies, and faces. 
 The new system is part of SenseTime’s push into “new infrastructure,” a term that includes smart city infrastructure, among other initiatives. The Chinese government announced massive investments in digital infrastructure over the next five years, inviting tech companies to participate in the program. Tech giant Tencent also recently announced its own investment of 500 billion yuan (US$70 billion) in digital infrastructure projects. 
 But while SenseTime’s intelligent patrol screen might be limited to Shanghai for now, its surveillance tech isn’t. SenseTime is one of the largest facial recognition companies in China, with SoftBank and Alibaba among its biggest backers. Last year, it was touted as the most valuable AI startup in the world, surpassing US$7.5 billion. 
 ( Abacus  is a unit of the  South China Morning Post , which is owned by Alibaba.) 
 The company’s rise has also invited scrutiny. Last October, as the US-China tech war was heating up, the company was added to a US blacklist that cut off its access to goods and services from American companies without approval. Along with 28 other organizations, SenseTime was accused by the US Department of Commerce of aiding human rights abuses against Uygurs and other minorities in China’s western Xinjiang province. In recent years, the Chinese government has ramped up mass surveillance in the region. 
 At the time, SenseTime responded to the blacklisting by saying that it abides by all the relevant laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it operates. It added that it has been developing an AI code of ethics to ensure its technology is used responsibly.

According to the company, this latest investment is part of its ongoing series F round and brings its total funds raised to over US$3 billion. 
 In March, the firm was said to have secured  US$1.2 billion  in new funding after raising US$1 billion in the first close of its series F round last year.

 The new funds will go toward developing the digital economy in Southeast Asia, with a focus on digital payments and financial services. 
 In 2015, Gojek launched its payments business GoPay to help micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises gain more access to the digital economy. The majority of these businesses rely on cash to operate due to the large unbanked population across the region. 
 The latest capital injection, Gojek said, will support more MSMEs and help them digitize further. 
 “The Covid-19 pandemic and its associated issues have served as a tough reminder that if our economies are to be more resilient, they must be underpinned by digital infrastructure that diversifies the ways in which people can live and transact,” said Gojek Co-CEO Andre Soelistyo. 
 GoPay has since connected merchants to more than 170 million users in the region and processes billions of transactions each year, according to the company. 
 As part of the deal, PayPal’s payment capabilities will be integrated into Gojek, which will allow GoPay users to access the payment giant’s network of more than 25 million merchants globally. 
 The deal also marks Facebook’s first investment in an Indonesia-based business. According to the statement, the social networking giant is seeking to create new opportunities for businesses in the country, including its messaging app WhatsApp. 
 “Gojek, WhatsApp, and Facebook are important services in Indonesia. Through cooperation, we can help millions of MSMEs and their customers to join the largest digital economy community in Southeast Asia,” Matt Idema, chief operating officer of WhatsApp, said. 
 Facebook’s investment in Gojek follows its  US$5.7 billion  injection in Indian digital services firm Jio Platforms as part of its WhatsApp push. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(0, 0.52703375), (1, 0.4726958)]","['Facebook', 'Gojek', 'WhatsApp', 'Google', 'GoPay']","['Indonesia', 'GoPay']"
648701,Analysis: Why Meituan could dominate China’s shared powerbank market," Meituan-Dianping has  moved back  into China’s powerbank rental sector after abandoning it around three years ago. This will reshape the industry by enticing millions of retail space providers with an  offer  they can’t refuse: Sign up for our powerbanks and get visibility in our apps for a better chance of reaching hundreds of millions of customers. 
 Retail space providers or merchants supply the real estate needed to house rental powerbank stations where users can borrow and return chargers. These kiosks are located in public spaces with high foot traffic, such as restaurants, movie theaters, shopping malls, office buildings, hair salons, karaoke bars, and other places of leisure and entertainment. 
   Shared powerbanks: A billion-dollar opportunity or fool’s gold?  
 
   
 Retail shops represent many of the more than 6.2 million vendors on Meituan’s platform, giving the company a natural advantage as it can immediately recruit them to join its powerbank ecosystem. 
 So how does  Meituan’s offer  work? Every time someone charges their phone with a Meituan powerbank on store premises, that shop will get a page view boost in Meituan’s ranking algorithm, resulting in greater visibility across the company’s apps and a better chance of being seen by its 451 million users. 
 Merchants only need to provide the physical space for powerbank stations and sign the contract to be entitled to 60% of rental revenue and the all-important visibility boost in Meituan’s marketplace. 
 Meituan’s offer [harks back] to the  advice  that Grab co-founder Anthony Tan got from Masayoshi Son , when the SoftBank CEO wanted to invest in the Southeast Asian startup: “You take my money. It’s good for you. It’s good for me. If you don’t take my money, not so good for you.” 
 Any shop that doesn’t become part of Meituan’s powerbank system loses out against those that do. Retaining an existing partnership with a different powerbank-sharing company is also a disadvantage – using another powerbank is a lost page view in Meituan’s ranking system.

 On the other hand, accepting Meituan’s offer seems to benefit all participating merchants as well as the customers they serve. 
 Vendors, for example, can increase page views at no cost – a welcome addition in an environment rife with ad fraud, where shops routinely buy traffic and falsify data to gain prominence in Meituan’s apps. Thanks to the new and more trustworthy signal for store quality, consumers get a better user experience and can make more informed choices on their purchases. 
 Meituan gains by getting higher revenue, user growth, and merchant retention. Rival rental powerbank companies are left behind and the market is fully at Meituan’s mercy. Its shared powerbank ecosystem also establishes a walled garden from which it can defend itself and attack new targets. 
 The company has leveraged its scale and network to put a virtuous growth cycle into effect. Merchants are compelled to only sign up for its powerbank rental system because of the advantages, and they could be locked into exclusive contracts to funnel users to Meituan’s platform. More users mean a wider customer base for merchants, giving them more incentive to sign up for Meituan powerbanks. The cycle repeats. 
 A brief history of shared powerbanks in China 
 The concept of shared powerbanks took off in early 2017, following the boom in bicycle-sharing after 2015. While operators in these segments are part of China’s sharing economy, they own all the goods they lease out on their platforms, unlike traditional sharing businesses like Uber and Airbnb. In that sense, it’s fair to also call it a rental economy. 
 Meituan experimented with the idea of shared powerbanks in late 2017, when the market was in its early stages. The company piloted projects in two Chinese cities, Shijiazhuang and Qingdao, but it quit the market after three months over a  purported  “lack of synergy with its other businesses.” 
 After Meituan’s exit in November 2017, powerbank sharing went from being an unknown market to a billion-dollar industry until late 2019, in a turbulent period known as the “War of a Hundred Chargers.”

 Today, the market is an oligopoly of four, but the path to stability was torturous and paved with startup failures. 
 The shared powerbank bank industry went through four stages, broadly mirroring the famous Gartner  hype cycle  and following a similar pattern of tech market evolution in China: 
 
 In early 2017, an innovation trigger led startups and investors to rush into the space. 
 In the second half of 2017, investors pulled back and startups struggled for market share. 
 From late 2017 through 2018, brutal competition led to market elimination and a dozen companies shuttered or left the market like Meituan. 
 In 2019, market leaders reached profitability, proving the sustainability of the shared powerbank model. 
 
 
  The Gartner hype cycle / Image credit: Gartner 
 
 Up until 2019, profit eluded market players and the viability of their business model was in question. People had their own powerbanks, which were cheap to buy. It wasn’t clear if they would embrace or even needed the rental model. Difficulties faced by bike-sharing, the totem of the sharing economy, compounded doubts. 
 An infamous son of a Chinese billionaire was so skeptical that he  proclaimed  in a now-deleted social media post that he’d eat poop if shared powerbank businesses ever took off. 
 The current market is dominated by four players: AnkerBox, Xiaodian, Energy Monster, and Laidian. All are profitable and accounted for over 85% of the Chinese market at the end of 2019, according to  iResearch . In less than two years, they helped build a market that’s worth 7.9 billion yuan (US$1.1 billion) and has 250 million users. 
 Biding time 
 By bowing out of the market early, Meituan avoided costly competition in an uncertain environment, allowing others to test, educate, and develop the market. But the company had its own set of challenges to contend with during this time. 
 In April 2018, competition in food delivery intensified as Alibaba  bought out  Baidu’s stake in then-leader Ele.me for US$9.5 billion. Meituan was also preparing for an  initial public offering  in Hong Kong that took place in September 2018, and its subsequent performance in the markets after listing was lackluster. In March 2019, it  announced  wider losses in its Q2 earnings, with shares dropping 25% from IPO prices. 
 Meituan did some reorganizing, withdrew from markets, and reworked platforms. It slashed delivery costs per order and  backpedaled  from its bike-sharing business overseas. The company’s car-hailing service  adopted  an aggregated model, hosting smaller players in order to better compete with the sector’s overwhelmingly dominant Didi Chuxing.

 In August 2019, Meituan posted its first profitable quarter, followed by strong results again in November and March 2020. Today, shares are up more than 70% since the 2018 IPO, and it is China’s third-largest publicly-listed tech company by market capitalization at over US$86 billion. 
 Throughout this, Meituan continued to focus on two key pieces it needed to upend the shared powerbank market: users and vendors, which it respectively grew from 280 million and 5 million in 2017 to 451 million and 6.2 million in 2019. 
 A second attempt 
 Meituan’s reentry to the sector comes amid rising powerbank rental prices, giving the company an opportunity to undercut rivals. Since September 2019, fees  have climbed  from a minimum of 1 yuan to 3 yuan per hour nationwide. Some upscale areas with high foot traffic have seen prices go up to 12 yuan an hour, causing some customers to complain. 
 It’s also returning to the space off the heels of Covid-19, a period of shutdown for the Chinese economy. Shared powerbank operators likely have limited to zero revenue after the government-mandated lockdowns nationwide from late January to the beginning of April. 
 Meituan is hitting its opponents while they’re vulnerable. 
 Meituan also suffered disruptions and saw  revenue decline  in the first quarter of 2020, but it grocery delivery service saw a 400%  jump  in sales in February. 
 By entering the powerbank-sharing market now, Meituan is hitting its opponents while they’re vulnerable after being starved of revenue for months. And as China’s social and economic activity slowly returns to normal, Meituan, with a cash of US$2 billion, can tide through a lull. 
 Lessons from an earlier war 
 Years before the powerbank sector came into existence, Meituan had fought – and won – in a much bigger war. 
 When it launched in 2010, Meituan was one of the 5,000 group-buying sites in China, each hoping to imitate the success of Groupon, the world’s startup darling at the time, on Mainland shores. What followed was the War of a Thousand Groupons, with these businesses engaging in a fierce venture-funded battle for market share. In early 2011, Groupon itself entered the Chinese market via a joint venture with Tencent. 
   
 Many group-buying companies relied on subsidies and advertising to quickly obtain users, who then jumped shipped just as fast when the next platform launched its special deals. Instead of marketing, Meituan focused on developing its product. By offering a reliable service and superior technology, it gained and retained its crucial set of initial loyal merchants, which it parlayed into more users and a wider list of clients. 
 When the war settled in 2013, only Meituan, Dianping, and Nuomi were still standing, accounting for 80% of the market. Two years later, Meituan and Dianping merged in a US$15 billion deal, and the combined company is now worth over US$80 billion. 
 An “everything store” 
 At present, Meituan-Dianping might be most famous for leading China’s food delivery market. It averaged 23.9 million deliveries a day in 2019 and controls close to  two-thirds  of the market, despite facing stiff competition from a well-funded and high-powered Ele.me. 
 However, Meituan’s success extends far beyond food delivery, a segment that represented 56.2% of its $13.7 billion in total revenue in 2019. Since 2010, the company has progressively expanded alongside China’s burgeoning consumer economy, successively connecting with restaurants in food delivery, cinemas for box office sales, hotels and transportation for domestic tourism, and more. 
 From its original berth in group-buying, Meituan has evolved into a veritable “everything store.” Its app features more than 6.2 million vendors and 200 services and products that span a vast range of sectors. Users can virtually conduct any consumer activity from the offline world. 
 Meituan bade its time and strengthened itself. 
 Meituan’s foundation and future success was forged during the War of a Thousand Groupons. Doubtless it learned much from the experience, as it seems to have applied the same strategy to conquer the shared powerbank market. 
 In both wars, Meituan bade its time and strengthened itself as competitors cultivated the market and destroyed themselves in the process, only swooping in to claim the fruits of their labor. 
 But this time around, Meituan is no longer a startup but a giant, so it can leverage its scale to devastating effect, strong-arming merchants into signing up for its service over rivals.

 The other clear difference is that for three years, Meituan didn’t even fight in the powerbank war. The reason why is now obvious: Its enemies were facing off on its turf, striving tirelessly to get placement in merchants’ stores since 2017. Meituan has owned the merchant relationship since triumphing over Groupon clones in 2013. 
 It’s as if Meituan owned a mall that leases space to millions of retail stores. For years, third-party powerbank rental services have vied to get their stations into these shops, only for Meituan to develop its own solution and offer it to customers, along with cheaper rent.

648628,"ByteDance plans to set up second entity in India, sources say"," 
 
 At a time when  ByteDance -owned short-video app TikTok is weathering mounting criticism due to objectionable content leading to a steep fall in downloads in India, the Beijing-based internet giant is setting up another entity in the country to provide IT services.

  The   Economic Times , citing two sources, said the new entity will likely offer IT-enabled support and services to ByteDance’s platforms globally. This would also include working on content generated across its various platforms, the report said. 
 While ByteDance operates TikTok in the international market including India, it specifically launched Helo for Indian users to compete with local incumbent Sharechat. Back home, it runs the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin, content discovery platform Toutiao, and video-sharing platform Xigua Video, among other apps. 
 ByteDance is expected to file an application with Indian regulators, including those in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, over the next few weeks, the report said. At present, it owns and operates ByteDance India Services in the country. 
 The Chinese internet conglomerate is looking to create a center of excellence in India in the near term, for which the company will be ramping up its workforce, one of the sources told the  Economic Times . According to the source, this will require data and technology transfer into the country, and hence the new entity. 
 ByteDance reportedly had a workforce of over 60,000 worldwide along with 15 research and development centers as of November last year. 
 This is in line with the company’s broader strategy of shifting its center of power away from China. The move seems to be aimed at mollifying the rising concerns across countries, including India, that its apps pose risk to national security and compromise users’ data privacy. 
 Earlier in May, ByteDance poached Walt Disney top executive Kevin Mayer, who led the successful launch of the company’s new streaming platform Disney+ late last year, and appointed him as CEO of TikTok. It also reportedly expanded TikTok’s engineering and research and development operations in Mountain View, California, a  Reuters  report said. 
 India remains one of the most important markets for ByteDance, where it pledged to invest US$1 billion last year. However, over the past few weeks, its most popular app TikTok has come under fire over videos that allegedly normalizes acid attacks, rape, animal cruelty, hate-mongering, and violence. Many netizens have since called for banning the app in the country. 
 Reportedly, TikTok’s downloads fell by 34% and 28% month on month in April and May (up to May 23), respectively. 
 India accounts for one-third of the overall 2 billion global downloads of the duo  TikTok and Douyin , according to a report published by Sensor Tower Store Intelligence in April. 
 The San Francisco-based marketing intelligence firm said India has been the biggest driver of TikTok installs, generating 611 million to date or 30.3% of the total. China was ranked second, accumulating 196.6 million to date, or 9.7% of all downloads. At 165 million downloads, the US is third in line in terms of apps installed.

648609,Xiaomi is getting ready for 6G," Although 5G phones are just starting to go mainstream this year,  Xiaomi  has already started pre-research into the next generation of mobile connectivity, according to the smartphone company’s co-founder and chairman Lei Jun.

 This wasn’t the first time Jun mentioned 6G. In May, during China’s annual legislative meetings known as the Two Sessions, the entrepreneur prepared four proposals for China’s next five-year plan. One of them is making satellite internet a strategic industry by including private companies, which would be a step toward developing 6G communications. 
 Jun later clarified that Xiaomi has no plans to launch satellites itself. But as he told local media on Sunday, 6G will require devices that support the base stations and satellites behind the new wireless standard. 
 But the concept of what 6G is remains vague, with no set standards defining it. Still, 6G is slowly becoming a buzzword among Chinese tech firms. Other companies already looking into 6G are telecom equipment maker ZTE and China Telecom, one of China’s three state-owned telecom carriers, which signed an agreement in May to research 6G together. 
 Both smartphone maker Oppo and Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei have also signaled their interest in the tech. China first started looking into 6G in 2018, making it one of the first countries to do so.

648573,Does this $133m bet on biodegradable ‘plastic’ hold water?," Around 1.4 trillion – that’s the amount of single-use plastic straws Singapore-based startup  RWDC Industries  is aiming to replace by 2025. Straws made from its  bioplastic  raw material called Solon can biodegrade in two months – a mere fraction of  the 200 years  that polypropylene plastic straws take to decay and be absorbed by the environment. 
 Producing and incinerating traditional plastic also results in the emission of greenhouse gases on a massive scale. In comparison, Solon-based products leave behind no harmful by-products after they decompose, according to RWDC.

 “As Solon is made from entirely renewable resources, every ton of plastic we replace will be preventing the corresponding release of methane or carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,” says RWDC co-founder and executive chairman Roland Wee. 
 Solon is a type of  polyhydroxyalkanoate  or PHA, a polymer that’s fully biodegradable in soil, and water, leaving no toxic residue. Apart from straws, Solon can be used in a wide range of everyday consumer goods, including cups, plates, and drink lids. 
 “Some people describe PHA as biodegradable, as it sounds very sexy, but scientists call it a thermopolymer. That means it is easy to degrade and melt,” explains Henry Leung, senior lecturer at the School of Chemical and Life Sciences in Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP).

 In June 2019, Solon made its debut at the  Ecosperity Week  in Singapore in the form of straws. RWDC says that “roughly a dozen clients” are now testing its products, and the straws will soon be available in several leading food and beverage outlets in the city-state. 
 The company declined to reveal its clients due to confidentiality agreements but said they’re “large global brand owners” and “multinational companies.” 
 Widening horizons 
 RWDC tells  Tech in Asia  that the firm’s new US$260 million plant in Athens, Georgia will be operational by the third quarter of this year. The US-based facility can initially produce about four kilotons of Solon per year, but output will be ramped up by over 80 times to 350 kilotons by 2025. The company also plans to build more plants in Asia to meet growing demand. 
 “We have designed our PHA production systems as 25 kiloton modules that can be quickly installed at locations that are defined to be strategic to best serve our customers,” adds Wee. 
 The company will also hire 200 more employees at its Georgia headquarters to support its “24/7 operations” and to fill needs for research, engineering, and business development.

 RWDC’s expansion plans come after its US$133 million series B in May. The round was co-led by Vickers Venture Partners, energy and resources firm Flint Hills Resources, and Swiss pension fund CPV/CAP Pensionskasse Coop. 
 A 2018 financial report indicates that RWDC had largely been investing in research and hadn’t reported any revenue as of yet. The company confirms this, saying that its focus to date has been on research and development, although it recorded some revenue from collaborations with clients in 2019. Wee tells  Tech in Asia  that he expects RWDC to be profitable in late 2021, when its first full-scale production module goes online.

 Wee and Georgia-based Daniel Carraway formed RWDC in 2015, coming up with the company name by combining their initials. They set their sights on solving a growing global crisis: our  dangerous dependency on single-use plastics . 
 But RWDC isn’t Carraway’s first foray into the plastics business. In 2005, he founded  Danimer Scientific , a company that makes  compostable polymers  like PHA. Carraway eventually sold the firm in 2014 for undisclosed reasons. 
 How it’s made 
 Apart from helping ease the world’s reliance on single-use plastics, RWDC upcycles waste products such as used cooking oil to mitigate  environmental problems . The company uses bacteria to convert the oil into PHA resin at its Athens plant. It sources the used cooking oil through an unnamed collection firm, which gathers it from restaurants and industrial food preparation facilities in nearby city Atlanta. 
 Explaining the production process, Wee says that RWDC’s microbes break down carbon in the used cooking oil into PHA, then stores it as an energy source. After a few days of fermenting, the substance is extracted from the bacteria before it’s purified to be sold to clients. The firm claims its production plant has “zero waste,” as it even recycles all the water used.

 “We convert 100% of the used cooking oil to biomass, and 80% of that is PHA,” shares Wee. That translates to about 0.8 litres of Solon generated from a litre of used cooking oil. The other 20% of the biomass – or organic matter that can be used as fuel – doesn’t go to waste, as it is also sold to other companies that use it as animal feed, fuel, or compost, he adds. 
 Yield or the environment? 
 From an environmental standpoint, it’s important that all byproducts of RWDC’s production process are reused, according to NYP’s Leung. 
 He notes that one of the biggest challenges for startups like RWDC happens during the extraction phase. “They aim for yield to impress companies to buy into their tech. [As a result,] they forget about environmental factors, like wastage.” 
 Leung previously worked on a project to make PHA from used coffee grounds, but faced resistance from companies during the pitching process due to his methods, which prioritized environmental impact over yield. 
 “But for companies, they would never sacrifice yield, even resorting to using additional heavy processes to extract that extra 1% to 2% of yield – taking it to the point where the power usage is almost comparable to that of producing traditional plastics. That defeats the environmental purpose of such projects,” contends Leung. 
 The price needs to be acceptable, too. 
 Jan Ravenstijn, an independent biopolymer consultant and veteran of mass industrial polymer makers DSM and Dow, agrees with Leung. “The name of the plastics game is high yields and low cost. But as much as the environment is important, the price needs to be acceptable, too.” 
 RWDC declined to reveal its price point or margins for Solon but said it’s sold at a “market-acceptable price range.” 
 Wee tells  Tech in Asia  that his firm is the “first company to manufacture PHA at an industrial scale and at an affordable price,” though Ravenstijn disagrees with that claim. 
 Based on his calculations, Ravenstijn estimates that Solon needs to be sold at less than US$4,000 per ton to be competitive. But he points out that traditional plastics, such as those in food packaging food are sold for much less by the ton. “Manufacturers are not ready to pay two to three times more to switch to a substitute, regardless of its eco-friendliness.” 
 According to  Argus Media , used cooking oil hovered at around US$690 a ton in April, with prices normally fluctuating between US$600 to US$700 a ton. At face value, this would mean that RWDC is increasing the commodity’s value by over five times. But this figure doesn’t factor in larger expenditures in equipment, research, and operating costs. 
 Ravenstijn also questions if RWDC is the first such company to produce PHA by the kilotons. “There are already competitors in the PHA space that have been operating on an industrial scale since late 2019. On top of that, they have been selling out already,” he says. 
    
     
 In Japan, Kaneka Corporation completed construction of a new plant to boost the production capacity of its polymer product  in December 2019 . It increased its output fivefold to around five kilotons per annum. 
 Closer to RWDC’s plant in Georgia, Carraway’s former company Danimer Scientific also  opened its first commercial PHA plant  in Kentucky last November, with a production capacity of 10 kilotons. In comparison, RWDC’s plant in Athens aims to produce four kilotons of Solon annually by the end of 2020. 
 RWDC declined to comment further, saying instead that it has “overcome all barriers to industrial scale production of PHA, making the right qualities, quantities, and types of PHA at the right price.” 
 Speaking of Solon’s quality, Leung is also concerned about its purity, saying that it may not be able to fully serve as a “drop-in replacement” for the many uses of traditional plastic like the company says. 
 “Different applications of plastic call for different requirements of PHA. PHA isn’t known for giving very good physical strength, hence, it may be a reach to say it could replace heavy-duty plastics,” he observes. “Achieving high purity would mean extra equipment and costs to further distill the product.” 
 Fellow academic Ravenstijn expressed a similar doubt. “PHA can’t be used to replace polystyrene as their polymer structures are vastly different. Manufacturing companies that turn plastic into items would need to recalibrate existing equipment at much [higher] costs.” 
 Responding to the scientists’ concerns, RWDC says that while Solon can’t replace plastics in probiotics packaging or outdoor furniture, it remains “ideal” as a drop-in replacement for single-use plastics use, such as straws and plates. 
 “New machinery is not required. In fact, existing machinery can be operated with lower energy consumption when replacing polystyrene with PHA,” Wee says. 
 Due to the variety of plastics in the market, PHA can’t replace them all, but it will likely work best for certain applications, such as coffee cup film liners, says  Circulate Capital  founder and CEO Rob Kaplan. 
 Circulate Capital launched a US$106 million venture capital fund dedicated to solving Asia’s plastic crisis. It received backing from conglomerates such as PepsiCo, Procter &amp; Gamble, Dow, Danone and Unilever. The firm has just invested a total of US$6 million into two plastic recycling companies in India. 
 In the broader plastics alternative industry, other startups have been making waves, including Australia-based Varden, which converts the waste material from sugarcane into biodegradable coffee pods that will replace those made from plastic.

 Varden, which has kept mum on its manufacturing process, recently announced  US$2.2 million in funding  from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s Horizon Ventures, which also backed Zoom, Impossible Foods, and Spotify. 
 The whole plastic-replacement platform is in its embryonic stage. 
 When it comes to getting manufacturers to make the switch, producers of alternative plastic have much to contend with, besides product purity, strength, and most importantly, price. But as concerns mount over the environmental damage caused by pollutants from plastic, the push to replace them with more sustainable materials has gained momentum. 
 It has also led longtime advocates like Ravenstijn to call for greater support from the public, governments, and corporations to help “turn the tables” on single-use plastics. He thinks demand for PHAs have finally outpaced supply, and firms like RWDC and Kaneka need all the help they can get. 
 “The whole PHA platform is in its embryonic stage. It’s slowly maturing. But what we need now is for legislators not to be a nuisance, and for them to be a facilitator,” he adds. 
 
  Billions of single-use plastic straws make it into the ecosystem every year, causing environmental issues. / Photo credit: 123Rf 
 
 RWDC’s Wee also recognizes that a sudden switch to PHA isn’t possible, noting that it’s looking to take“baby steps” to change governments’ mindsets. Big corporations need a push as well. Soft drink giant Coca-Cola, for example, has  shown reluctance  to do away with single-use plastics, citing how “consumers still want them.” 
 For Coca-Cola, Wee suggests starting with small changes “Perhaps we can start with the bottle cap, rather than the bottle itself, as there is regulatory pressure on detachable plastic closures in jurisdictions like Europe.” 
 NYP faculty Leung is bullish on the alternative plastics sector, believing that it’s possible for the world to make large-scale changes given enough motivation. 
 “Solutions such as PHA may seem far-fetched, but if millions make the switch, a huge impact can easily be seen,” Leung says. “That would reset the clocks on plastics pollution, giving the Earth time to recover from this plastic pandemic.” ",Joseph Gan,2,10,"[(0, 0.9917186)]","['Varden', 'NYP', 'Unilever', 'Dow', 'Solon', 'PHA', 'RWDC', 'Carraway', 'Danone', 'DSM']","['Georgia', 'US', 'Earth', 'Singapore', 'Atlanta', 'kiloton', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'Gamble', 'Nanyang', 'India', 'Japan', 'Athens', 'Australia', 'Kentucky']"

 Its operations in the country will begin in Bengaluru, with Urban Ladder co-founder Rajiv Srivatsa leading the charge as partner, according to a statement. 
 Antler’s inaugural India program will kick off in the city during the second half of the year and is expected to run over a six-month period in two phases. The company also plans to enter other major cities in India in the next three to five years. 
 “Over the next five years, India is expected to be the third-largest market and grow into a 5 trillion-dollar economy, fueling a much higher growth for the digital economy,” Magnus Grimeland, the founder and CEO of Antler, said. 
 In the first phase of the program, Antler will extend its global resources and expertise to help founders build the right teams. The founders will also receive a monthly stipend during this phase. 
 After 10 weeks, the VC firm will invest in the strongest groups, who will then advance to the second phase of the program. 
 “Today, India is at the stage where China was a decade ago,” said Srivatsa. “We will launch an India fund and collaborate with the entire ecosystem including VCs, angels, and work closely with corporate partners and functional specialists as mentors to power the India opportunity ahead this decade.” 
 Srivatsa started Urban Ladder in 2012, helping the company raise over US$100 million in venture capital from marquee investors. Prior to that, he held several positions at companies such as Yahoo, Cognizant, and Infosys. 
 Founded in 2017, Singapore-based Antler has a presence in 11 locations worldwide. It has already invested in and helped build over 160 companies since launch, including freelancing platform Sampingan, eSim vendor Airalo, and machine learning and robotics startup Cognicept. 
 In April, Antler announced that it would be investing a total of up to  US$500,000  in startups tackling Covid-19. It’s looking to back up to five startups that can propose solutions in areas such as mitigation, remote health, digital tools, and medical equipment.

 In its Hong Kong public offering, the gaming giant plans to offer a total of 171,480,000 shares for up to HK$126 apiece to raise HK$21.3 billion (US$2.8 billion). Of that total, 5.15 million shares will be offered locally, with the remaining to be offered internationally, according to a prospectus filed June 2. 
 Assuming that the overallotment option is exercised, the offering will have a total value of around US$3.2 billion. 
 In the prospectus, NetEase said it will use about 45% of the proceeds for its global expansion plans. This includes further investments in Japan, the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia. The company also plans to set aside another 45% for research and development, while the rest will go to general corporate purposes. 
 NetEase is only the second company to launch a secondary listing in the city, following Alibaba’s successful Hong Kong IPO last year. Ecommerce major JD.com is expected to follow suit on June 18 to raise up to US$3 billion by selling 5% of its shares,  Reuters  previously reported. 
 Recently, the US Senate passed a bill that bans companies from listing on US exchanges if they fail to comply with audits for three years in a row. In its filings with the Hong Kong stock exchange, NetEase cited the legislation as a potential risk for investors. 
 In January 2020, reports also surfaced that several other Chinese tech giants are eyeing secondary listings in Hong Kong as tensions between the US and China continue to rise. Those companies include search engine Baidu, fast-food chain operator Yum China, and travel services provider Ctrip. 
 At the time, the companies were holding talks with global investment banks. However, it’s still unclear how the Covid-19 pandemic has shifted these plans.

648366,Meet the startup that created its own ‘university’ to answer Asia’s AI talent shortage," Artificial intelligence has the potential to  reshape the world , but one thing is holding the industry back: a lack of qualified talent. 
 In 2017, there were  300,000 AI practitioners  around the world, but compare that with the millions of job vacancies in the data science field, and you’ll see the problem. As the demand for data scientists continues to rise, the issue will only get worse. 
 Businesses have responded by  rolling out various measures , such as investing internationally to expand their talent pool or providing in-house training to upskill their staff. 
 Others are tackling the problem from the ground up by working with educational institutions to train new AI talent.

 Launched in 2017, Transwarp University was initially created as a way to train the company’s customers on how to use its products, says Transwarp’s founder and CEO, Sun Yuanhao. 
 “Our customers needed to know how to use our product, but they [also had to] have a deeper knowledge of big data in order to use it effectively,” he explains.

 Besides educating customers, Transwarp also worked with China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to provide data science training and certification programs for people looking to upgrade their skills. 
 However, the company realized that these programs would not be able to fully address the lack of data science workers in the market. As the demand for talent continues to increase, Transwarp found that there would be an estimated 2 million unfilled positions in AI and data science by 2026 in mainland China alone. 
 In order for the business to grow, it needed to play a bigger part in addressing the issue and developing the AI ecosystem. The solution: bringing Transwarp University to actual schools and learning institutions. 
 Entering the mainstream education sector 
 When Transwarp first began approaching schools, the main problem it encountered was getting administrators to see the importance of having a proper AI training program. While universities were aware that data science was a big trend, it was not something they were particularly concerned about developing. 
 “The key thing was to educate [the universities] and show them that they need focused data science programs,” says Sun. “Schools had programs for mathematics, computer science, statistics – all the parts of big data, but separated.”

 With Transwarp University, the company helps educational institutions design AI and data science training programs by providing expertise and advising on curricula. It also offers the know-how for schools to construct their own data science laboratories which allows students to gain hands-on experience. To date, the firm has already partnered with some of China’s top colleges like Peking University and Fudan University to open big data and AI research labs. 
 For Sun, businesses and schools need to collaborate in order to provide the best learning experience for emerging AI talent. 
 “Schools teach and help students gain knowledge, but they cannot provide industry experience,” he explains. 
 Indeed, opportunities like internships and on-the-job training would enhance a student’s learning experience, says the CEO. 
 Going regional 
 Largely based out of China, Transwarp is now looking to take its university program abroad. 
 The company already has several partners in Singapore – it’s working with  Singapore Polytechnic  to provide enhanced learning opportunities in data science for students and  AI Singapore  – an AI program launched by the government – to develop training programs in the country. 
 In the future, Transwarp hopes to expand the program to other countries in the region, such as Indonesia, where the government is currently developing a  national AI strategy . 
 Ultimately, Sun believes that growing the data science talent pool is a big requirement for the AI industry to flourish. 
 “The industry needs to develop well, [in order for] businesses to develop well too,” he says. 
 
 Transwarp is one of China’s leading big data and AI platform providers, focusing on enterprise-level cloud computing on container, big data, and AI core platform research and services. Transwarp University, the company’s education and training arm, aims to help cultivate AI and data science talent in China and abroad.

 Founded in 2018, the startup plans to use the new funds to expand its virtual docking systems. The model ensures that riders park the scooters in predetermined parking spots by offering incentives through the Beam mobile app. 
 Beam will also use part of the fresh capital to deploy its third-generation e-scooter Beam Saturn across Asia Pacific and grow its mobility fleets in Korea, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Taiwan. 
 The company said it will also roll out new features focused on keeping parked e-scooters safe for pedestrians to minimize vehicle loss. 
 “The success of any new technology depends on mass acceptance, and the quicker and better we can ensure e-scooters are used and parked where they should be, the more welcoming city residents will be,” Deb Gangopadhyay, co-founder and chief technology officer at Beam, said. 
 Beam will also enhance its initiative called Beam Safe Academy, introducing online training and expanding its real-world scooter training program to ensure rider and pedestrian safety. 
 The startup noted that amid Covid-19, shared open-air mobility provided by e-scooters remains a safe and an affordable transportation option. 
 The transportation industry as a whole has been significantly affected during lockdowns. Indian ride-sharing  Ola , for example, cut 1,400 jobs and reported a 95% drop in revenue over the past two months.  Grab , meanwhile, saw volumes in its ride-hailing business declining by double-digit percentages in some markets.

648507,Insurtech startup PolicyStreet banks $1.8m in series A money," Malaysia-based insurtech startup  PolicyStreet  said it has raised US$1.8 million in series A investment in a round led by existing backer KK Fund. 
 The investment round also saw participation from another Singapore VC fund, Spiral Ventures. PolicyStreet gained the support of both international and local angel investors through equity crowdfunding platform PitchIN, according to a statement.

 Launched in 2017, PolicyStreet’s online platform enables consumers and businesses to choose and purchase insurance policies based on their needs. It also uses a hybrid offline-to-online operating model to communicate insurance complexities to its customers. 
 In 2019, the company obtained approval from the Central Bank of Malaysia to become a  financial adviser  and Islamic financial adviser, allowing it to work with over 35 insurers and offer more than 1,000 insurance products. 
 With the new funds, the startup plans to further improve its product, increase sales and marketing efforts, and expand into other emerging markets in the region. PolicyStreet co-founder and CEO Yen Ming Lee told  Tech In Asia  that the company is currently looking into entering Indonesia as well as Indochina within the next six to 12 months. 
 “Covid-19 has increased the awareness and need to have adequate insurance protection, which has accelerated the business demand for PolicyStreet,” said KK Fund general partner Koichi Saito. 
 Lee said that the firm has seen a shift in the type of insurance products its users are searching for and buying amid the pandemic, moving from travel insurance to medical policies. The chief exec also noted that the company has seen its sales for the first quarter grow by 580% year over year. 
 Since its inception, PolicyStreet claims to have reached roughly 225,000 customers, selling 36,000 policies worth roughly US$832.8 million. Its partners include Great Eastern, Allianz, Zurich, AXA, and Manulife. 
 With its Southeast Asian expansion plans, it is primed to go up against other startups such as B Capital-backed CXA, Gojek’s GoSure, AMTD-backed PolicyPal, and Singtel-backed Igloo (formerly Axinan).

648505,Tencent reportedly in talks to invest $200m in Warner Music," Chinese tech giant Tencent is in talks to invest US$200 million to buy a stake in Warner Music Group ahead of the record company’s initial public offering, the  Wall Street Journal  reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

 Warner Music is also working to add other anchor investors to invest more than US$1 billion towards its fundraising goal of up to US$1.8 billion, the sources said. 
 The IPO, which is expected to price between US$23 and US$26 per share, is predicted to give the company a valuation of as much as US$13.3 billion. It could be the largest New York IPO so far in 2020, according to the report. 
 Warner Music – home to popular international artists such as Cardi B, Ed Sheeran, and Bruno Mars – had initially announced its plan to go public in February but delayed it due to Covid-19. 
 The report on Tencent’s potential investment in the company comes after a Tencent-led consortium  acquired a 10% stake  in Universal Music Group for nearly US$3.4 billion. The deal brought the company’s market value to around US$33.7 billion and gave Tencent access to artists such as U2, Drake, and Taylor Swift. 
 Tencent’s music service Tencent Music Entertainement reported a total of  US$891 million  in revenue for the first quarter of this year, up 10% year over year. The unit, dubbed China’s Spotify, currently has 657 million mobile monthly active users, with 6% paying for its services. 
 Most recently, Tencent said it raised a total of  US$6 billion  in debt financing. It also announced plans to invest US$70 billion in technologies such as cloud computing and AI over the next five years. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(0, 0.9993182)]",[],"['China', 'AI']"
648428,What happens when remote working becomes the new normal?," Covid-19 may change the way we work forever. 
 Depending on which city you’re based in, you’ve probably been working from home for at least two months. Chances are, you’ll continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future as companies figure out how they can resume their businesses while instituting social distancing measures. 
 For sure, workers will return to a different office environment. But beyond needing to regularly check their temperatures and constantly wear face masks, their work desks will look different as well. Open-plan co-working spaces, for instance, are now making room for partitions. 
 For Singapore-based flexible workspace provider JustCo, this means reducing the number of seats and spacing out furniture in common areas and meeting rooms, a move that could impact revenue. Meanwhile, Jakarta-based CoHive is rolling out more private offices across its properties.

 Even as office landlords implement design changes post-pandemic, many companies including tech giants  Facebook, Google, and Twitter  are allowing their employees to telecommute using video-conferencing platforms and other office productivity and collaboration tools for a prolonged period. What this means for companies is that they can lease fewer office spaces or give up their leases entirely. 
 This paradigm shift in the way companies view their offices has already weighed on commercial real estate rentals across Asia, with transaction volumes slumping 51% in Q1 2020, according to  a report  by real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank. Office leasing activity dropped 73% in April as companies around the region had their employees work from home, the same report revealed. 
 Combined living, working spaces 
 The outlook for the office rental market looks grim, particularly in Jakarta, where several startups are downsizing or closing shop. Those that can carry on with their businesses are giving up their office leases in the central business district and moving their employees to co-living spaces that provide remote working facilities. 
 One such company is startup consultancy firm Trident Global Services. CEO and founder Manu Asvalyan says he ended the company’s co-working space arrangements in the Jakarta CBD area, as the offices became inaccessible to his employees after the government imposed a lockdown in March. 
 “Our deliverables had to happen, but our teams couldn’t travel to the designated office spaces,” Asvalayan says. “So the only available option for us was to work from home. Wherever the team is, they can still work together.”

 Instead, Trident is currently renting five three-bedroom apartments in a co-living space operated by  Flokq  outside Jakarta’s CBD. The units are occupied by up to 15 IT engineers from India who are working on several Trident projects in Indonesia. To make the apartments conducive as workplaces, Flokq refurbished and rearranged the units to accommodate extra desks and other office amenities such as projectors. 
 “We have to work hard and perform better during this pandemic to ensure that our projects don’t end up being terminated,” Asvalayan says, adding that consolidating co-living and co-working spaces together has helped lower the company’s overhead costs by as much as 35%. 
 Anand Janardhadan, founder and CEO of Flokq, is indeed seeing more startups consider leasing out combined co-living and co-working spaces from his company – it’s getting many inquiries. So far, the startup has booked four to five clients in these combined office and residential spaces. 
 We don’t have to pay double rent. 
 Another client that has taken up such an arrangement is Buy and Ship, a direct-to-consumer logistics services provider based in Hong Kong. “By leasing a combined co-living and co-working space, we don’t have to pay double rent,” says Sheldon Li, Buy and Ship’s founder and CEO. “Work is also more efficient that way.” 
 Meanwhile, YOLOlive, a co-living space operator in Singapore, has started marketing its properties similarly. One of its marketing emails reads: “Perfect bedroom to work from home.” 
 “We do see an increasing demand for the living space to function as a work space too,” says YOLOlive co-founder and CEO Loo Kian Wai. With Covid-19 likely to be around for a while, it could influence work habits in the long term, leading to permanent demand for work-conducive co-living spaces, he adds. 
 Nobel Group, a property developer and investor in Australia and Indonesia, is taking the concept further. It is developing an apartment block in Kemang in South Jakarta, about 10 kilometers away from the city’s CBD, that combines co-living and co-working spaces in a seven-story building, says Akash Mulani, the company’s director. 
 Slated to be completed in 2022, the project will have 100 units of two- and three-bedroom apartments, with the first two levels housing co-working facilities for use by the building’s residents. Flokq will lease the entire block from Nobel Group and operate it as a combined co-living and co-working space. Rival provider CoHive, which operates co-living and co-working spaces across Indonesia, says it is also working with developers to incorporate office amenities in their apartments.

 Despite the emerging trend of combined living and working spaces, Mulani believes offices won’t go out of fashion. “The office is just evolving. I don’t think it’s dead at all. The overriding feeling is people have missed their offices. The collaboration that offices allow is unparalleled,” he says. 
 Anthony Couse, CEO for Asia Pacific at real estate consultant Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), agrees. “We think offices will remain central to daily business life. Looking ahead, we believe that this is a resilient sector that will continue to draw long-term investor interest and confidence.” 
 The workplaces of the future will be different as organizations reevaluate how their offices are designed in the wake of this pandemic, a recent  JLL report  predicted. 
 Offices will shrink as companies decentralize their work spaces into smaller facilities across different locations and as a certain percentage of employees work from home for a prolonged period, the report reveals. Technology will drive these workplace changes, providing the infrastructure that connects the workforce of the future. 
 Expansion plans on track 
 Reflecting confidence that demand for co-working spaces will remain, JustCo says it will still proceed with expansion plans, but the timeline for these projects will be pushed back since many countries around the region are still in lockdown. 
 “We are confident that coworking will still play an important role as companies are becoming more aware than ever of the need for flexible working solutions,” says Brandon Chia, JustCo’s vice president and head for Singapore and Indonesia. 
 The company announced in February that it plans to expand across 11 cities, including Bangkok, Jakarta, Melbourne, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, and Taipei. 
 Similarly, CoHive says it believes demand for co-working spaces will be sustainable even after Covid-19. “We are optimistic that the demands of the office space would not be changed fundamentally,” says CEO Jason Lee. People believe that “physically interacting with one another” is the most productive way to work, he added.

648340,There’s no such thing as a perfect layoff," 
  Photo by Aarón Blanco Tejedor on Unsplash 
 
 Dear readers, 
 Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc on the economy, and founders are forced to find ways to reduce burn and extend runway. As a result, layoffs have become increasingly common among tech companies, and there’s a lot of advice floating around on how best to do it. 
 Common tips include: 
 
 Do it fast and communicate transparently. 
 Do it once and do it well. Don’t suffer death by a thousand cuts. 
 Be humane. Speak with everyone personally and help them move on as soon as possible. 
 
 While these are sound suggestions that founders should consider, I don’t believe there’s a perfect layoff plan. Carrying out layoffs is like cutting off an arm to save the whole body. You know you have to do it, but just the thought of it and the act itself will hurt a great deal no matter how much you prepare for it. After the surgery, you will need time to heal and so your body can get used to its new normal. 
 We cover a fair bit of layoff-related stories and regularly receive letters from employees complaining about their employers. By sharing my thoughts candidly, I hope to provide some helpful perspectives during this difficult period: 
 1. It’s likely our first time to experience a layoff. 
 What goes up must come down. And hey, even a titan like Alibaba once  went through a rough patch . 
 We enjoyed a tech boom that lasted for almost 10 years. Even if Covid-19 didn’t happen, a market correction was imminent. Most companies were set up less than a decade ago, so this pandemic is likely the first big challenge we’re facing. And for many founders, this is probably the first time that they have to let go of staff. 
 The same goes for the relatively young employees in tech – this is probably their first encounter with layoffs. And just like any kind of breakup, the outcome tends to be unpleasant, no matter how well we plan it out. 
 2. It is OK to be angry or upset. 
 No one likes layoffs – not the executor and definitely not the receiver. So it’s OK to be upset or get angry. Take your time to grieve, but don’t do anything that may jeopardize your future. 
 The best people I know always look at the bright side of life and move on to their next adventure. There are three zones you can live in and you get to choose where you want to be: 
 
 Fear zone (unhealthiest): You think that life is unfair, so you complain and forward all the silly messages you can find. 
 Learning zone (healthy): You recognize that this is happening to everyone. This enables you to identify your emotions and become aware of the situation. 
 Growth zone (healthiest): You’re patient and on the lookout for opportunities. You’re making good use of your time. 
 
 Don’t forget the colleagues who are still at the company. It’s hard for those who are going, but it also ain’t easy for those who are staying. It helps to leave with gratitude in your heart. 
 Last but not least, founders are humans too, and they have emotions. They have to continue running the show and protect the rest of the company. They’re doing their best, but it’s understandable if disgruntled employees don’t think that’s the case. 
 3. Founders have to be transparent. 
 Whatever is causing the fuck-up, own up to it and explain why. It’s better to take responsibility for the problem and work on the root issues – usually it’s the founders themselves. Don’t deflect and put the blame on something else. 
 Covid-19 is the perfect storm for masking failures that lead to hard decisions. If you’re a founder, have some heart and speak honestly. Your teammates deserve to know the truth. 
 4. There’s no one-size-fits-all severance package. 
 Everyone has different needs and wants. Some want money while some want to save face – it can be hard to decipher. There were occasions when unhappy employees have demanded “better treatment” to get a more favorable severance package. The conversation usually goes along these lines: 
 
 
  “Hey, Mr. Bossman! Please just look at XYZ company and learn how they lay off their employees with kindness. What you did really isn’t fair because [insert reasons]. You mean all of our hard work is worth just [X severance package]? We deserve better! 
   Let me tell you, it’s not even about the money. It’s how you communicated the layoff and treated people. The values you printed on the office walls aren’t real. You should be ashamed of yourself.”
 
 
 I believe founders should follow local regulations and give what they can without putting the company’s cash position, existing employees, and future growth on the line. 
 On the other hand, it’s really OK for employees to ask for a better severance package. If that’s what you need for the next chapter of your life, just go for it. Don’t put on a show and beat around the bush. It’s unhealthy and reflects badly on you. 
 5. There’s no perfect layoff plan. 
 Planning for a layoff is a herculean task. If you cut too deep, you may lose the opportunity for future growth. If you don’t cut enough now, you risk having to cut more later, which will dampen morale further. 
 If you communicate swiftly, you’re seen as reckless and emotionless. But if you drag it out, people will question why you have to prolong the pain,  “Just tell me the truth already!” 
 There are so many other factors to consider, including: 
 
 Are layoffs necessary or will pay cuts suffice? 
 If layoffs are necessary, who gets cut? 
 How can the company justify it? Is cutting just a numbers exercise? 
 How does the company communicate the move? 
 How much severance can the company give without killing the business? 
 How does the company maintain the morale of existing team members? 
 How can the company help ex-employees to move on? 
 How does the company engage with the press? 
 
 Some are pointing to Airbnb as the  gold standard  for executing layoffs, and I agree. Brian Chesky wrote a beautiful letter and has a good heart. But let’s also be honest: Airbnb can do such an amazing job because it has capital and resources. Can you imagine writing an emotional letter but offering a severance package worth only two weeks of base pay? 
 Unfortunately, that isn’t the case for most companies. The core reason for layoffs is the lack of cash – there isn’t enough in the bank for everyone. 
 6. Our July 2018 layoff wasn’t perfect, either. 
 About two years ago, we executed a layoff. Because of my poor leadership –  building too many products at one go  – I had to let go of 31 team members. Morale took a hit and that number ballooned to over 70 good people who left – most of them voluntarily – at the end of the emotional ride. 
 It took me a while to recover from that, so I can empathize how hard it is for employees and founders who have to walk through the same path. My heart is with you. If you persevere and pull through, you will discover a lot about yourself. You may even find the ordeal as a necessary lesson. 
 This was my endnote in the company-wide letter addressing the layoff two years ago: 
 
 
  “This will forever be a sad week in  Tech in Asia’s  history, and we are truly sorry for causing hiccups and friction in everyone’s lives. We don’t wish for this outcome while building a company. 
   For those who are staying to fight, let’s make this week’s pain and sacrifice count. Make it count by winning, make it count by being profitable, make it count so we don’t further let down the team members we have painfully chosen to leave behind today.”
 
 
 This dreadful but necessary optimization and  our readers’ support  helped us move on and build a better  Tech in Asia  for everyone. 
 To those who got hurt during the layoff, I’m sorry. It was never your fault. I hope that you’ve recovered and I trust that you’ve gotten to a better place in life. 
 Thank you. 🙏 
 Cheers,

 Under the partnership, JD.com and Gome will work towards better supply chain integration and share resources in logistics, installation services, and financial services, among others. 
 The move serves as a continuation of the two companies’ cooperation after Gome launched its flagship store on JD.com in March this year. It’s also part of JD.com’s strategy to extend its reach in home appliances, the company said in a statement. 
 Last year, JD.com invested in electronics retailer Five Star, mobile phone and accessories retailer D Phone, and Lenovo’s smart retail unit Lecoo, among others. It also created diversified formats, including JD E-Space, JD Computer and Digital Products Stores, and JD Home Appliance Experience Stores. 
 It has partnered with Gome to further develop an ecosystem based on its infrastructure, including supply chain, logistics, and technology, JD.com said. 
 To date, the company claims to have more than 2,600 brands on its platform, with over 100 million yuan (US$14 million) in sales each.

 Through the collaboration, GrabKios will provide digital products on the Mitra Bukalapak platform that kiosk owners and agents can sell, giving them an additional source of income. Currently, there are more than 5 million members and agents on Mitra Bukalapak throughout the country. 
 “We know that many of these traditional kiosks are struggling as a result of the pandemic. At the same time, we have seen the dependencies on digital services grow as more people stay at home,” said GrabKios head Agung Nugroho. 
 Digital kiosks enabler Kudo rebranded to GrabKios last year after it was acquired by the ride-hailer in 2017. The program allows small businesses to provide additional services such as mobile top-ups, bill payments, Grab driver registration, and money transfers. 
 Mitra Bukalapak works in the same manner as GrabKios, allowing roadside kiosks to sell Bukalapak-powered digital goods to offline customers. 
 The micro, small, and medium enterprise sector is the backbone of Indonesia’s economy, contributing 60% of the country’s GDP and making up roughly 70% of its workforce. Apart from that, 99% of businesses in Indonesia are MSMEs, of which 89% are at the micro level. 
 Late last year, Bukalapak announced a partnership with  Google My Business  to bolster its Warung Mitra Bukalapak program. As part of the tie-up, registered Mitra Bukalapak kiosks started appearing in Google search results, including Google Maps.

648283,How this Philippine company innovates to stay at the forefront of digital transformation," From secure online payment platforms such as PayMaya to online booking apps like Grab, technology is part of everyday life for most Filipinos. But this wasn’t always the case. 
 Buzz around digital transformation only  peaked  globally between 2014 to 2016.  UnionBank of the Philippines  brought the term to the country when it started its own transformation journey in 2016, investing  90%  of its capital expense – around US$58 million – to do so. It was a success: The bank saw  improved quarterly numbers . 
 These results  encouraged other business leaders to explore  the growth possibilities that digital transformation could unlock for them. 
 “Businesses need to transform digitally to adapt to the changing market demands in order to grow and become more significant in the subsequent years,” says Jovy Hernandez, president and CEO of  ePLDT . A subsidiary of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), the company focuses on enabling digital business solutions in the archipelago.

 While companies agree that digital transformation is the future, plenty struggle to successfully make the transition. In the Philippines, many brick-and-mortar organizations still use legacy platforms and traditional business methods. 
 According to Cobena Business Analytics and Strategy’s 2019 Digital Transformation Survey,  the majority of the enterprises in the Philippines  – including the government – were stuck in the initial stages of their digital transformation journey. Family-run corporations cited the  generation gap  as a hindrance in their efforts. Other barriers, such as a lack of resources and adoption guidance, don’t help. 
 These are the issues that ePLDT aims to address with its end-to-end information and communications technology (ICT) services, designed to help enterprises jumpstart their digital transformation. 
 Digital transformation to the rescue 
 When ePLDT first stepped into the ICT scene, its goal was to establish a network of purpose-built data centers to support parent firm PLDT and its wireless telecommunications arm. Today, ePLDT controls the largest network of data centers in the Philippines, consisting of 10 interconnected facilities called  Vitro  across Metro Manila and beyond. 
 The company has expanded its suite of ICT solutions through the years. In 2012, its  cloud  services were introduced, followed by its  cybersecurity security  offerings in 2016, and most recently, its  managed IT  solutions in 2019. 
 Its services have had a social impact. The  Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation  (PDRF) sought help from ePLDT to ensure that its systems – which handles confidential data –  would be able to fend off cyber attacks . This is particularly important for the emergency operations center, which serves disaster-stricken communities across the country. 
 Existing PDRF security technologies received upgrades via ePLDT’s managed security service, which included management and maintenance for its firewall. The foundation could also count on a 24/7 cybersecurity team, courtesy of ePLDT’s security operations center-as-a-service. 
 On cloud nine 
 Beyond protecting mission-critical data, ePLDT enables firms to become more agile and flexible and lowers the cost of ownership of data through its managed, hybrid, and end-to-end cloud services. 
 These capabilities caught the eye of one of the Philippines’  financial services providers . As part of the company’s digital transformation initiatives, it sought help from ePLDT to move its on-premise IT infrastructure to the cloud and to outsource its operation and maintenance. 
 “To date, ePLDT cloud engineers and experts have gained over 700,000 hours of combined experience in cloud support and management,” shares Hernandez. 
 As solutions, ePLDT presented its Cloud  Infrastructure-as-a-Service , as well as access to system operations. Together, these helped the financial services provider to save on IT infrastructure costs, which allowed it to focus on strategic initiatives and to respond efficiently to business demands across its 200 branches across the Philippines.

 Staying ahead of the curve 
 Staying at the forefront of digital transformation doesn’t happen on its own. Investments in the latest technologies and best practices is something ePLDT constantly works on, and its efforts through the years have been rewarded through various certifications. 
 “Our Vitro Data Centers are ISO-certified for our quality, information security, IT service, and business continuity management systems,” says ePLDT’s Hernandez. “Moreover, our data centers are also in compliance with the global standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council, Philippine Economic Zone Authority, the Telecommunications Industry Association, and NTT Communications.” 
 To optimize its 20-year-old data center, Vitro Pasig, ePLDT partnered with French multinational firm Schneider Electric in 2019 for a three-year transformation project. The tie-up will equip the data center with new technology and infrastructure that will allow it to generate more power and accommodate the increasing application requirements of its customers. 
 Beyond infrastructure, ePLDT says it also invests in its employees through training and certification programs. 
 The data center operations team, for example, undergoes Design &amp; Build training frameworks so they can eventually acquire certifications that will allow them to properly operate and fulfill the business resilience and design requirements of Vitro Data Centers. 
 Under its managed IT services, employees undergo training programs in partnership with organizations such as Cisco, Dell, Microsoft, and Red Hat as well. 
 Ultimately, ePLDT’s main goal is to support organizations in the  Experience Age , especially those working towards digital transformation. 
 “We will continue to explore new ways to enable the growing digital transformation needs of our customers,” Hernandez says.

648392,Klook pivots to home-based local experiences as it adapts to a new normal," Hong Kong-based travel booking platform  Klook  has launched Klook Home, a new service that lets users book home-based experiences, as it kick-starts business recovery and tackles the “new normal” of travel. 
 
  Photo credit: Klook 
 
 Klook Home offers almost 200 home-based experiences such as do-it-yourself craft and cooking kits, online workshops, and free virtual tours. 
 For markets with stay-at-home regulations like Singapore and the Philippines, Klook Home offers home-based activities. Markets that have eased policies, such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, could leverage its list of local activities within the city or other cities, the company said in a statement. 
 According to Klook’s search data, about 60% of the total number of searches across Asia Pacific and Europe are related to domestic experiences, indicating rising local interest in them. 
 Klook Home, which has been rolled out to 14 markets in Asia Pacific and Europe, is part of the startup’s multistage approach to recovery. 
 Klook is expanding its offerings of local experiences after it saw an uptick in bookings in April during its pilot run in South Korea and mainland China. The startup said it aims to capture local demand first, which will help pave the way in providing a range of offerings for both intra-regional and overseas travelers in the future. 
 Klook is also launching Klook Academy, which aims to help merchants optimize their offerings for the new normal. The initiative will provide workshops and webinars on topics such as marketing and operational excellence. 
  See also:  A roadmap for online travel’s long, painful path to recovery   
 The startup’s strategy comes after the Covid-19 pandemic has severely hit the travel and hospitality industries. Last month, the startup said it’s streamlining its workforce through  furloughs or layoffs  in an effort to weather the crisis. The decision was said to impact up to 20% of its total headcount. 
 Klook’s co-founders and other leaders have also given up their salaries and taken pay cuts, respectively. 
 “Covid-19 has inevitably altered the future of travel, and we must continue to be nimble to capture new opportunities,” said Eric Gnock Fah, chief operating officer and co-founder at Klook. “Global travel may be some time away from now, but we are confident to seize every opportunity […].” ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(1, 0.9996665)]",['Klook'],"['Singapore', 'Europe', 'Taiwan', 'Philippines', 'China']"
648352,A new accelerator’s pro-founder solution to investor ‘bad behavior’," For Mikaal Abdulla, founder of Hong Kong-based personal finance startup 8 Securities, raising venture capital can be “miserable,” no thanks to flaky investors who disappear after signing term sheets or indiscreet backers who share confidential data with competitors, just to name a few. 
 “It’s a seemingly benign characteristic that seems to run deep in so many VCs in Asia. That characteristic is a lack of empathy. Empathy deficiency is what really makes Asia’s venture capitalists special… and not in a good way,”  wrote  Abdulla, whose firm was  acquired by US-based Social Finance (SoFi)  in April 2020. 
 Abdulla says he has raised a total of US$70 million in the past decade and has been in “at least 150 investor meetings.”

  Asia’s flourishing tech scene  has drawn an influx of venture builders, accelerators, and VC firms to the region, but between the numerous accelerators that have folded and the proliferation of new ones, their success has been called into question. 
 Conversations with founders reveal an undertone of unhappiness about how the balance of power is often tilted in favor of investors. Many acknowledge – and even accept – that between accelerators, investors, and entrepreneurs, a misalignment of incentives is a given. 
 Adding to that, a lot of investor advisors are former management consultants or banking and finance professionals who haven’t established startups before. Their lack of experience has placed startups at the receiving end of unfavorable deal terms and poor advice. 
 To change that status quo, a trio of former founders set up  Iterative , an accelerator designed to be operator-led and founder-friendly. 
 A pro-founder approach 
 Iterative is finalizing its first cohort of nine startups, says managing partner Hsu Ken Ooi, who started the company with Brian Ma and his brother Hsu Han Ooi. 
 The three serial entrepreneurs established machine learning company Decide, which was acquired by Ebay in 2013. Divvy Homes, a home ownership startup that Ma co-founded, recently raised  US$43 million  from investors including GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund. 
 It’s hard to empathize with the founders you’re working with if you’ve never been in their shoes. 
 Iterative is modeled after the principles of California-based Y Combinator (YC)’s principles – the golden standard for startup accelerators, as far as Hsu Ken is concerned. 
 This includes a large, active alumni network of founders helping other founders and deals structured to benefit startups as well as pro-founder policies such as an internal blacklist and a review system of past and existing investors who are screened by other YC founders. 
 Effectively, this precludes investors with a poor track record from working with other YC startups in future. “There are specific rules. If you have a term sheet and [the investors] don’t follow through, they get blacklisted and [can] never invest in a YC company again,” Hsu Ken says.

 The relative inexperience of Southeast Asia’s accelerator operators compared to their Silicon Valley counterparts was an impetus for starting Iterative. “The majority of people that run accelerators [in the region] haven’t founded and sold their own companies,” observes Hsu Ken, who was born in Penang, Malaysia, grew up in the US, and moved to Singapore two and a half years ago. 
 Establishing a business means you go through the entire process of realizing an idea, finding market fit, pursuing growth, achieving monetization, and getting acquired. It’s a unique experience, and someone who’s gone through that trajectory is generally better able to empathize as well as offer more tangible advice and perspectives, he adds. 
 “It’s hard to empathize with the founders you’re working with if you’ve never been in their shoes. I don’t think you can understand the level of risk that they’re taking, and the level of self-doubt that they have on a daily basis,” Hsu Ken says. 
 A lonely road 
 Being a founder comes with a distinctive set of challenges, which non-founders might not be able to fully grasp. “Entrepreneurs need investors that understand that first-hand and will have their back during tough times. Waking up to find out your best engineer has resigned, your product broke overnight, and you can’t pay your rent next month is the norm,” Abdulla shares. 
 For many founders, the road to setting up and running a company is a lonely one, riddled with self-doubt that never really goes away. Hsu Ken noticed that many first-time founders in Southeast Asia struggle in isolation. “I felt like everybody was solving the same problems on their own,” he says. 
 You get the feeling [that investors believe] that startup founders should be lucky to get face time with them. 
 Hsu Ken, who was part of networking startup  Weave  – a YC company – says he owes a lot to founders who were “mentoring us when there was no reason to.” He hopes that Iterative will foster a similar sense of community through internal tools that will allow founders in the batch to book consulting time with and rate mentors or seek help from other founders. 
 Regular “small group meetings” among founders will also help cultivate camaraderie. It will also hold events including an alumni demo day and potentially an annual camping trip – similar to what YC does. 
 Then there are power imbalances – a reality in the startup scene – which founders have to grapple with. Between venture capitalists and founders, “the party writing the check has the upper hand,” Abdulla notes. 
 In Southeast Asia, however, the power equation is “way out of control,” says Hsu Ken, citing conversations he’s had with founders in the region. “You get the feeling [that investors believe] that startup founders should be lucky to get face time with them.” 
 In contrast, the power scales in Silicon Valley have gradually tilted towards startup founders. At VC firm Andressen Horowitz,  partners are “fined”  US$10 for every minute they’re late to a meeting with an entrepreneur – a show of respect for the founders they deal with. 
 Abdulla has also heard instances where VCs have taken advantage of their position of strength to request information that may be useful to another portfolio company or in making an investment decision. Some corporate accelerators have turned out to be more pro-corporate than pro-founder. 
 “I have seen fintech startups given the ‘opportunity’ to build a prototype for a bank, and that eats up all of their focus and independence. Of course, it can be valuable for the startup but I rarely see it materialize into anything meaningful,” he points out. 
 Are program fees necessary? 
 There’s also a debate around whether accelerators should be charging program fees. 
 In Singapore,  Antler  invests US$100,000 in exchange for 10% equity stake in a company, but it charges US$40,000 in program fees – or 40% of the investment sum – to cover the costs of running the program. Each individual also receives a monthly stipend of S$3,500 (US$2,460) for 10 weeks.

 “Program fees are the standard in the industry – some people choose not to show them, but we have chosen to be fully transparent… This package is on par with peers regarding the financial structure,” says Jussi Salovaara, managing partner of Antler Singapore. 
 “However, we do believe we differentiate ourselves with our global platform and our dedication to support our founders through our global advisor and alumni network,” he adds. 
 The practice isn’t exclusive to Antler. San Francisco-based 500 Startups, for instance, charges a US$37,500 participation fee that’s deductible from its US$100,000 investment. Participants are encouraged to consider this  as their tuition fee . 
 Other accelerators may not impose program fees, but they find other ways to bake in these costs. “Every program has a fee component in some form,” says an industry observer who spoke to  Tech in Asia  on the condition of anonymity. Accelerators that don’t charge outright could simply plunk down a smaller investment sum, take a larger stake, or impose higher fund management fees, the source suggests. 
 “A model like an accelerator, a [startup] generator or a talent investor is, in general, resource-intensive. Someone needs to pay for it – ultimately, it comes down to an arrangement between the fund investors and the people running the program,” the source adds. 
 Entrepreneur First (EF), which calls itself a “talent investor,” says that instead of collecting fees, the costs of running the program are “passed up” to the fund’s limited partners. 
 Iterative, which doesn’t charge a program fee, has raised initial funding from some investors and its founders personally bankrolled the program. Investing a full US$150,000 upfront in exchange for 15% of equity has the benefit of aligning their incentives with the startups that they back from the get-go, Hsu Ken explains. 
 Iterative, however, takes a bigger stake in each startup compared to other accelerators. 
    
     
 A good or bad deal? 
 The program fees might deter some founders, but others are unfazed. Mike Sayre, chief executive of robotics company Cognicept, formed his team through Antler and considers the chance to connect with a good co-founder “priceless.” 
 There are now roughly  dozens  of incubator and accelerator programs in Singapore. Many are run by corporations and public institutions such as universities, each with its own structure and goals. 
 It’s like choosing a university – what kind of experience do you want? Do you want a liberal arts kind of experience, or do you want to be super-focused on one MBA? 
 Since their motivations differ, their success is hard to gauge. Corporate-backed accelerators, for example, are often designed to infuse the main business with innovation. On the other hand, those like EF, which has incubated startups such as internet-of-things company  SensorFlow , helps individuals find co-founders and ideas, with a particular focus on deep technology. 
 It’s tempting to judge each program – whether it’s a seed accelerator or venture builder – based on their common denominator: capital investment. “Startups have no idea how valuable this thing is going to be, so they seize on that number and obsess about [cash]. [But that’s the] least valuable thing that the startup gets,” says JFDI co-founder Hugh Mason tells  Tech in Asia . 
 JFDI was an active startup accelerator from 2010 to 2015, investing seed money in some 70 companies such as jobs platform Glints. 
 But for many, the process of fast-charging a concept from zero to one, culminating in a “demo day” is in itself invaluable. Gaining the skills to run a business, getting access to an enduring network of like-minded entrepreneurs, and bridging new markets and customers are also important. 
 “It’s like choosing a university – what kind of experience do you want? Do you want a liberal arts kind of experience, or do you want to be super-focused on one MBA? They’re totally different experiences, one size doesn’t fit all, really,” Mason adds. 
 Hsu Ken and his team are chasing a lofty goal, but could signs like serial accelerator-hopping mean that existing programs are inadequate? 
 Only a “very, very small” number of entrepreneurs jump from one accelerator to another, says Bernadette Cho, general manager at EF Singapore. She says that some founders had completed other accelerator programs before approaching EF, and vice versa. Each program offers a different environment, and that might explain why they go around and explore, she suggests. 
 Enlisting in accelerator programs based abroad could also be advantageous for startup founders. They can open up new customer bases overseas by leveraging their local connections. “It can be a smart play around customer and also investor acquisition,” Cho says.

 Antler alumnus and Cognicept boss Sayre, who raised a seed round through Sequoia’s Surge last October, says that selecting an investor or program boils down to finding “smart money and the right partner – somebody who can help us connect to the right customers and people.” The latter is critical since his company operates in the niche field of robotics. That’s also why Sayre says he’s open to going through another accelerator program “if the valuation is right.” 
 A well-trodden path 
 Last November,  YC shut its doors in China , saying it was “not the right time to run a new, country-specific version” of the program. The move raised doubts about the viability of Silicon Valley-style accelerator models in Asia. 
 JFDI, the first accelerator in Southeast Asia,  ended its program in 2016  because of high costs and a tight market for tech talent, but it continues to mentor its portfolio companies in its capacity as a shareholder. 
 Around four years later, the same structural challenges remain for accelerators in the region. Southeast Asia also lacks large groups such as Google and Facebook in the US that are constantly on the hunt for early-stage companies. Facebook’s  recent purchase of Giphy  is an example of this appetite for acquisition. 
 Without an opportunity to exit, it’s a long wait for both investors – accelerators included – and successful entrepreneurs, before they move to the other side of the table and become investors themselves. 
 Will Iterative find success in Southeast Asia given how others have tried and failed? 
 Iterative believes that a combination of factors, including high internet penetration, a fast-growing internet economy, governmental support as well as strong founders returning home, are heralding a  golden age for the region . 
 “We strongly believe that Southeast Asia is at a tipping point where all of these things will start to turn,” Hsu Ken says.

 With the investment, the company plans to expand its product offerings and grow its teams in Southeast Asia. Wiz employs scientists, researchers, linguists, and dialogue designers in its offices in Singapore, China, and Jakarta. 
 Launched last year, the startup focuses on developing conversational AI for Southeast Asian languages. The company said its solution can help businesses cut costs while improving customer service with personalized inbound and outbound calls. 
 Its front-end talkbot encourages customers to engage more in conversations. The back-end, meanwhile, sifts through the data in real time and stores insights from the conversations into the company’s existing customer relationship management system. Wiz then analyzes the data at both the granular and aggregated levels. 
 According to a statement, the startup currently serves businesses in healthcare, insurance, banking, telecommunications, and ecommerce sectors, as well as the Singapore government for payments. 
 Meng Xiong Kuok, founder and managing partner at K3 Ventures, noted that automation is important for business continuity especially amid the Covid-19 crisis. 
 The development of AI in Southeast Asia still  lags behind  AI global hubs such as China and the US. Singapore, however, is currently leading in AI implementation across the region. In November last year, the city-state rolled out a national AI strategy and committed more than S$500 million (US$354 million) to fund AI activities under its Research, Innovation, and Enterprise 2020 Plan.

 Endofotonics was founded in 2013 by Lawrence Ho, a senior consultant gastroenterologist with the National University Hospital in Singapore. It is currently led by CEO Peter Cheng, chief operations officer Chew Jing Ming, and lead optical specialist Harsono Cahyadi. 
 Its core 12-person team has developed Spectra IMDx, a system that enables real-time detection of early gastric cancer during endoscopy. It uses Raman spectroscopy, a non-destructive chemical analysis technique, embedded within an optical probe that can fit through an endoscope. It then leverages machine learning algorithms to look for molecular changes that typically occur beyond the stomach lining. 
 “Leveraging on Raman spectroscopy, we have developed a platform technology that can be applied to multiple organs, giving clinicians real-time information to make decisions then and there,” said Cheng. The technology can also be adapted to help identify safety margins for dissections or resections, the CEO added. 
 With the new funds, Endofotonics aims to drive commercialization efforts for Spectra IMDx in Asia Pacific and extend the technology’s cancer detection capabilities for other organs. The company also looks to launch its system in Europe and selected countries in Asia in 2021. 
 Endofotonics secured its series A funding in 2016 from Zig Ventures and Enterprise Singapore investment arm Seeds Capital. Zig Ventures worked with Ho to build Endofotonics’ core team, while Enterprise Singapore helped the company gain access to global talent, according to a statement. 
 Ted Tan, chairman of Seeds Capital and deputy CEO of Enterprise Singapore, said they will keep working with Endofotonics in commercializing Spectra IMDx in the region and beyond. ",Miguel Cordon,1,2,"[(1, 0.9995832)]",['healthtech'],"['Asia', 'Spectra', 'Singapore', 'Europe']"

 The company has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding in a round led by US-based Next Billion Ventures to further improve its platform, develop new products, and enter new markets. 
 Wavemaker Partners, as well as fintech-focused funds Dymon Asia Ventures and Accion Venture Lab, also participated in the round, according to a statement. 
 “More than a stopgap measure, early access to salary allows employees to enjoy a broader range of opportunities, no longer held back by financial stress,” said Advance co-founder and CEO Jaime de los Angeles. 
 The company looks to provide an alternative for cash-strapped Filipinos, who usually turn to payday lenders. “We are not a loan [provider] – our service acts as a financial bridge,” the chief exec emphasized. 
 In the past 12 months, Advance claims to have provided close to US$3 million to thousands of Filipinos across the country. It was also able to obtain institutional lending capital from major banking players in the Philippines last year.

648246,Can TikTok’s new CEO solve all its problems?," Short-video platform TikTok  announced  last week that it had pulled off a major coup by hiring Kevin Mayer, Disney’s head of streaming, as its chief executive. 
 The ex-Disney executive, who assumes his new post in June, will also serve as the chief operating officer of Beijing-based ByteDance, TikTok’s parent firm. Known as a dealmaking whiz in the US entertainment scene, Mayer could help the app deal with some of the biggest barriers hindering its global expansion. 
   
 Industry experts see TikTok’s poaching of Meyer as the next step for a business that has been ramping up its expansion plans and boosting its international presence. While the move will help TikTok establish itself globally, some observers believe that even with Mayer on board, the company will find it challenging to address rising concerns over its Chinese ownership. 
 Who is Kevin Mayer? 
 At Disney, Mayer got the nickname “Buzz Lightyear” not only because of his looks, which resemble the  Toy Story  character, but also because of his confidence and relentlessness. 
 As the right-hand man of recently retired Disney CEO Bob Iger, Mayer was with the entertainment and media conglomerate for 15 years and was instrumental to its acquisition of Marvel Entertainment, Pixar Animation Studios, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox. 
 He led the launch of Disney+ streaming service in November 2019 and oversaw Disney’s direct-to-consumer businesses, including Hulu and ESPN+, as well as its international operations.

 Mayer, who was passed over as chief executive of Disney in February, will lead TikTok’s global expansion and report directly to ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yiming, the company said in a statement shared with  Tech in Asia . 
 ByteDance declined to comment further on Mayer’s appointment. 
 At TikTok, Mayer will oversee corporate functions, including corporate development, sales, marketing, public affairs, security, moderation, and legal. He will also lead ByteDance’s music, gaming, and emerging businesses as well as Helo, a social media app popular in India. 
 Alex Zhu, the current TikTok CEO who co-founded Musical.ly, will transition to vice president of product and strategy at ByteDance. 
 TikTok’s China operations, which generate most of ByteDance’s revenue, will still be led by the executives in the country, bypassing Mayer, who will be based in Los Angeles and focus on international operations. 
 ByteDance appointed new leaders for its China operation  in March  including chief executive Kelly Zhang Nan, responsible for ByteDance’s key products in China including news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, Douyin (the China version of TikTok) and streaming platform Xigua Video. The company also appointed Zhang Lidong as the chairman to oversee China market’s non-product operations such as strategy and monetization. 
 A natural move 
 Heightened scrutiny around its Chinese ownership has been a stumbling block for ByteDance. With a market capitalization estimated at around  US$100 billion , it’s regarded as the world’s highest-valued startup. 
 Placing Mayer at the helm of TikTok may come as a surprise to some, but for industry watchers, it was a natural move for ByteDance to make. Who could do a better job at turning TikTok into a global entertainment platform than a seasoned American media executive who spearheaded Disney’s video-streaming initiatives?

 ByteDance has been vocal and aggressive about its global ambitions over the past three years. The startup recently stepped up efforts to step up TikTok’s presence in North America. Last year, the company was reportedly considering setting up a global headquarters for TikTok outside China. 
 Mayer’s appointment is part of ByteDance’s executive hiring spree in the US and Europe that began last year. Former YouTube executive Vanessa Pappas began  running TikTok’s US operations  as general manager in February 2019. London-based Ole Obermann, who wasWarner Music Group’s chief digital officer, joined TikTok in October 2019 as vice president and global head of music. In April 2020, the company recruited cybersecurity veteran  Roland Cloutier  as its chief information security officer. 
 As its global presence grew last year, TikTok raked in over US$3 billion in profit, with over US$17 billion in revenue,  Bloomberg  reported. Additionally, the company has about US$6 billion cash on hand. 
 As most of the world went on lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, TikTok became one of the most downloaded apps in the first quarter of 2020. According to mobile analytics firm App Annie, TikTok almost tripled its monthly active users over the past year to more than 390 million outside of China – a rare accomplishment for Chinese software companies. In the first three months of the pandemic, the app gained an additional 13 million monthly active users in the US alone. 
 As TikTok’s CEO, Mayer could boost ByteDance’s global business – not just for TikTok but also for its nascent gaming business and a slew of other products, such as music-streaming app Resso, according to Shan Jialu, an economist and scholar specializing in Asian and emerging markets at the International Institute for Management Development. 
 Mayer was head of corporate strategy at Disney, orchestrating important acquisition deals in gaming and various areas. In 2010, Disney snapped up social game developer Playdom, which was one of the hottest startups in Silicon Valley at the time. Disney eventually shuttered Playdomin 2016 and discontinued  Marvel Avengers Alliance  and its other games. 
 He also oversaw content created and produced by Disney’s Studio Entertainment, the segment that includes its music arm, among others. 
 Despite all this potential, TikTok still faces impediments, such as stronger regulatory headwinds and scrutiny in the US over its China ties. Hiring foreign executives could help put some distance between the company and its home country. 
 That’s exactly why some experts are baffled by the decision to parachute Mayer into the COO post at ByteDance. 
 “The nexus between ByteDance, Douyin and TikTok is too tight,” points out Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy firm AgencyChina. As such, widening the gap between the three is vital to allaying “fears that TikTok could be used as a vehicle of foreign influence,” he adds.

 Mayer’s dual role in TikTok and ByteDance will also make it hard for TikTok to assert that its “management, operations, content, and data are insulated from Chinese government interference,” notes Norris. 
 For instance, US lawmakers are looking into whether the app exposes the country to security issues. ByteDance is currently  under investigation  for the  acquisition of Musical.ly  in 2017. In January, the US Army ordered military personnel to remove TikTok from government-issued devices, warning that the platform “poses a potential national security risk.” 
 Just recently, TikTok was hit with a massive  class action lawsuit  in California for allegedly collecting and storing users’ biometric data without their consent. 
 TikTok has been working hard to address concerns around its Chinese ownership. In March, the company announced plans to set up a content moderation transparency center in its Los Angeles office. ByteDance also  stepped up  lobbying efforts in Washington late last year. 
 Shedding its “China image” could become increasingly crucial to TikTok’s chances of success in markets overseas. A company spokesperson  recently told  The New York Times   that TikTok is “not owned by a Beijing-based company” because ByteDance “is incorporated in the Cayman Islands.” 
 To infinity and beyond 
 Mayer may help smoothen the path for ByteDance as it ventures into the US and overseas markets, but regulatory hurdles will likely persist. 
 Hiring Mayer could polish ByteDance’s overseas image, and his experience in the entertainment industry and rich connections in Washington may help TikTok deflect some of the issues related to China. 
 One of the problems that TikTok faces in the US is complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Last February, the company paid nearly US$6 million to  settle  allegations that it illegally collected personal information from users under 13 years of age. 
 With his experience at Disney, Mayer understands COPPA and will be an asset to helping TikTok navigate uncharted waters. 
 However, his appointment may also lead to new but inevitable challenges. After Mayer’s hiring made the news, Sen. Josh Hawley, one of the US senators who introduced a bill to ban federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued phones,  posted on Twitter : “TikTok previously told me they couldn’t attend hearings and testify because executives were located in China. But this new executive lives in the US. I look forward to hearing from him. Under oath.” 
 Treading a thin line 
 TikTok’s predicament is shared by many Chinese companies that want to go overseas. They need to build their international image while at the same time maintain a cordial relationship with the Chinese government. 
 ByteDance is no stranger to red tape. Chinese regulators repeatedly threatened to take down one of its most popular products in China, Jinri Toutiao, from app stores due to concerns about how low-brow and salacious content run rampant on its platform. 
 Last month, Chinese regulators ordered ByteDance to  temporarily suspend  downloads of its office collaboration app, Lark (or Feishu in Chinese), after discovering that the platform’s newsfeed function allowed users to browse content from blocked sites such as Facebook and Twitter. 
 Chinese media and content companies are encountering scrutiny in other parts of the world as well. JOYY (formerly known as YY), the company that owns livestreaming app Bigo Live and TikTok rival Likee, came  under fire  for similar reasons. 
 “TikTok, like Facebook and YouTube, are at the center of culture and politics in countries around the world,” says Jeffrey Towson, professor of investment at Peking University. “They are required to do censorship and content moderation because users upload the content, and some of it will offend the sensibilities of each country. If users are uploading nudity in Indonesia, TikTok will have to remove it.” 
 To thrive in the US in the long run, ByteDance’s leader needs to be someone that people know and trust. When issues do occur, Americans will look to the head of ByteDance – that’s Zhang Yiming – just like they look to Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, and Apple’s Tim Cook for solutions. “Right now, they don’t know Zhang Yiming at all. Hiring Keven Mayer doesn’t change this,” explains Towson.

 Despite the setbacks ByteDance’s foray abroad has gone well compared to its peers. Its “going global by doing local” strategy seems effective – the locals just know much better than anyone else, Shan observes. Chinese tech companies have added foreigners into top management before. Some examples include Alibaba president Michael Evans, Mobike vice president Chris Martin, Ping An Technology CEO Jessica Tan. 
 Even though management in Chinese companies have become more diversified in recent years, “foreigners often played a side-role, focusing on specific projects and units outside of the Chinese core business,” noted Schwarzman Scholar Alexander Kremer in his  blog . This is largely due to the rising skill levels among the local workforce and Chinese professionals returning from overseas stints. 
 Mayer may prove to be an exception, given the importance of TikTok to its parent company’s future. ByteDance has made it in the global scene, making it a rarity among China’s software startups. As such, the challenges it needs to tackle are unique or even unprecedented, as some might say.

648258,ByteDance reportedly hit $3b in profit last year," China’s  ByteDance , the parent company of video-sharing app TikTok, has recorded a net profit of more than US$3 billion last year, people familiar with the matter told  Bloomberg . 
 The company more than doubled its revenue to over US$17 billion from US$7.4 billion in 2018. The jump was driven by a significant growth in user traffic that lured advertisers from Tencent and Baidu. 
  Tech in Asia  reached out to ByteDance but a spokesperson for the company declined to comment.

 Aside from TikTok and its Chinese version Douyin, ByteDance also operates news aggregator Toutiao and enterprise messaging app Feishu, among others. It has amassed around 1.5 billion monthly active users for all its apps, according to the report. 
  See also:  A visual timeline of TikTok’s rise   
 Sources say the company currently has over US$6 billion of cash on hand. ByteDance was recently valued between US$105 billion and US$110 billion on the secondary markets, and an analyst in the  Bloomberg  report expects the company to reach a market value of US$150 billion to US$180 billion in an initial public offering. 
 Last week, ByteDance announced that it has roped in Kevin Mayer, who had spearheaded the rollout of Disney video-streaming service Disney+, to be the company’s chief operating officer and TikTok’s CEO. Mayer will be leading the music, gaming, and emerging businesses at the Chinese tech giant. 
 ByteDance also earlier revealed plans to  hire 10,000 employees  to expand its global headcount to 100,000 this year amid the pandemic. It looks to recruit for high-level research or software coding roles to support its existing business as well as expand to new businesses such as gaming and ecommerce. 
 As of November last year, the company has over 60,000 employees and serves over 150 markets, according to its website. It has offices in 126 cities globally, including Shanghai, New York, London, Paris, Mumbai, Singapore, Jakarta, Seoul, and Tokyo, among others.

648259,Chinese tech giant Tencent raises $6b in debt,"  Tencent  said it has raised a total of US$6 billion in debt across multiple series of notes.

 The deal was finalized early today, with the notes expected to be issued on June 3 this year, according to a term sheet. Tencent raised US$1 billion in five-year, nearly US$2.3 billion in 10-year, US$2 billion in 30-year, and US$750 million in 40-year debt. 
 This is the largest transaction by a non-financial company in Asia so far this year, according to a  Reuters  report that cites data compiled by Refinitiv. 
 The Chinese tech giant said it plans to use the proceeds from the bond sale for refinancing and general corporate purposes, without providing more details. 
 Earlier this week, Tencent said it’s set to invest about US$70 billion over the next five years in emerging tech areas such as cloud computing and AI. The move will support the company in its competition with other tech giants in the country, including Alibaba and Baidu. 
 Tencent will also issue up to US$20 billion of new bonds to bankroll these plans. After the issuance of the US$6 billion notes, Tencent will have US$18 billion of notes outstanding under the program. 
 The company recently reported total revenue of  US$15.2 billion  for the fourth quarter in 2019, its strongest quarter for the financial year. It posted nearly US$3.7 billion in profit, up 29% from the same period in 2018. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.9992308)]","['Baidu', 'Reuters', 'Refinitiv']","['Asia', 'Alibaba', 'AI']"
648249,Uber looks to move APAC headquarters from Singapore to Hong Kong,"  Uber  said it’s prepared to move its Asia-Pacific headquarters to Hong Kong from Singapore if the government provides a regulatory framework that would legalize its operations in the country.

 The move follows Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s announcement last week that the company will be  closing  its Singapore office as part of its business resizing efforts. 
 The US-based company said it was confident of the long-term economic opportunities in Hong Kong, where trip levels already hover around 70% of the firm’s pre-crisis numbers. Before it fully invests in the city, however, Uber said it plans to work with the state government to build a regulatory framework for ride sharing. 
 Currently, it’s  illegal  for vehicles not licensed as taxis or those without hire car permits to “carry passengers for rewards,” according to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. The city has also been cautious about unfair competition allegations against Uber in other markets as well as its unclear legal relationship with its driver-partners. 
 Despite these challenges, Uber was able to scale its business in Hong Kong after arriving in the market in 2014. It claims to have almost 250,000 driver-partners that serve over 25% of the city’s population. 
 “We have always had big ambitions for Hong Kong, but the lack of progress on regulating ride sharing has held back the kind of investments we have made in other global cities,” said Estyn Chung, Uber’s general manager for Hong Kong. 
 If the company’s plan to move its regional headquarters to Hong Kong materializes, it will establish a local innovation and engineering hub in the city to create job opportunities and help grow Hong Kong’s tech ecosystem.

648248,SoftBank Vision Fund said to cut 10% of workforce," After posting a  US$17.7 billion loss  on the valuation of its portfolio companies, SoftBank’s Vision Fund is planning staff cuts that could affect 10% of its workforce of about 500 employees,  Bloomberg  reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

 According to one source, the cuts will affect all staff levels. Vision Fund, which is headquartered in London, also operates in Tokyo and California. 
 The company declined to comment on the issue, according to  Bloomberg . 
 So far, the US$100 billion Vision Fund has invested in more than 80 companies that are worth nearly US$70 billion. For full-year 2019, SoftBank lost almost US$10 billion from its investments in Uber and WeWork alone. 
 The fund has been struggling since WeWork shelved its initial public offering, which prompted SoftBank to offer a US$9.5 billion package to rescue the US-based co-working startup. 
 Meanwhile, Uber recently announced that it would  shut down 45 offices globally  and lay off 3,000 more employees, as it’s seen an 80% drop in its ride-hailing business during the Covid-19 pandemic. Oyo, SoftBank’s biggest bet in India, also  saw an up to 60% drop in revenue  and occupancy rate. 
 “It makes sense that SoftBank is cutting positions at the Vision Fund as they are in an extremely difficult situation, and they may start targeting highly paid workers to cut costs,” Koji Hirai, the head of M&amp;A advisory firm Kachitas Corp, was quoted as saying in the  Bloomberg  report. 
 In the company’s latest earnings call, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son warned that 15 of its portfolio companies might go bankrupt, while some may make it to the other side. 
 But given the first Vision Fund’s performance, SoftBank has been struggling to raise money for Vision Fund 2, securing just  US$2 billion  in its initial close last year. The company was aiming for a starting size of US$108 billion for the second mega fund.

648132,Why falling in love with a new technology isn’t a solid basis for a business," One observation I’ve gathered from more than 25 years of working in online real estate is that too many proptech entrepreneurs become so infatuated with a technology that they try to build their businesses around it. 
 Targeting market gaps is one of the first things every business student learns. That’s why entrepreneurs should build their businesses on providing something that people want but don’t have yet, instead of around a flashy new piece of tech.

 The technology-first approach is most obvious in the blockchain space. It’s the classic case of a solution in search of a problem, and fans have been searching for something useful that the tech can do in the Asian proptech scene for the past 10 years – without material success. 
 While blockchain may be elegant and fascinating, it will ultimately remain a niche technology if the market does not need this so-called solution. 
 Case in point:  An article  published in May 2018 heralded the Hong Kong blockchain companies to watch. Now, the only thing left from one of them is a message on its website that begins, “To all creditors…” One other company closed down in March, and the website of another blockchain business contains nothing more than offers to sell its domain name. 
 For years, hyperbolic headlines have claimed that blockchain will enable fractional ownership and thus revolutionize real estate ownership. Yet not one big player has found a compelling enough reason to use blockchain for this purpose. The fact that using blockchain would mean recording transaction and investor details in a decentralized public ledger probably does little to encourage investment platforms and their users to embrace it. 
 Indian commercial property platform  Propshare Capital  is probably the most successful fractional ownership vehicle in Asia. It has closed more than US$70 million of investment in institutional grade commercial real estate. Notably, it does not rely on blockchain. 
 Early on in its trajectory, my real estate firm Juwai IQI had also settled on a technological solution first before finally understanding the problem we were trying to solve. We had created a property search technology on our portal that worked beautifully, similar to the search tools you would find on the best domestic property portals around the world. Unfortunately, it left our own users mystified. 
 We hadn’t sufficiently considered our users’ needs: They neither were domestic buyers nor have the same level of general market knowledge as the locals. They were overwhelmed by the number of listings, often didn’t know the names of the suburbs or neighborhoods, and sometimes preferred to search by intent rather than location. 
 We fell in love with the search technology, which kept us from working to solve the actual problems that had plagued our users. Our role was to help them find suitable properties, yet our early search tool was not suited to this task. 
 In other cases, some proptech entrepreneurs fall in love not with a particular technology but with saving cost. They display an excessive focus on doing things cost-effectively rather than delivering a better outcome. This is another classic pitfall in proptech, and in the startup community in general. 
 Free or freemium listings portals are a typical example. They attempt to compete with advertising-supported real estate portals by offering free listings to property marketers, but these players soon find out that promising savings is not as compelling to users and customers as they expected. 
 One Thai real estate listings portal, for instance, claims to enable its users to advertise and discover Thai properties at no cost. But a glance reveals the limitations to its services, similar to those in other freemium portals. The most distinct one: It only has a few thousand listings, meaning it cannot attract a huge number of users. 
 In comparison, the alternative of advertising on a portal that has more listings and users seems worth a reasonable expense. 
 This, at any rate, seems to be what the market has decided. That Thai real estate portal has very few users compared to the more traditional Thai property platforms that get more than  1 million visits per month , as well as more advertisers. 
 A compelling offer depends not just on the price but also on its value. 
 Those who are developing their proptech businesses must remember that they can succeed only by solving a real problem. 
 They need to determine whether they have simply fallen in love with a technology and are thus looking for a problem it can solve; if so, they may have to go back to the drawing board. Success comes not from using the most exciting technology (or from offering the lowest cost) but from offering a solution to a real problem – a solution people will be willing to pay for.

648212,Ola Electric acquires e-scooter firm Etergo to launch own two-wheelers in 2021," Ola Electric, the electric vehicle unit of Indian ride-hailing heavyweight  Ola , has announced its acquisition of Etergo, a European electric scooter company, to help bolster its plans to build its own two-wheelers locally by next year. 
 Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

 Based out of Amsterdam, Etergo’s scooters use “swappable” batteries that enable them to travel up to 240 kilometers. The company, which has raised a total of US$23.3 million to date, is currently valued at around 84 million euros (US$92 million), according to a  Reuters  report. 
 With the deal, Ola now owns the intellectual property of Etergo as well as its EV design and engineering capabilities. The company recently started offering preorders for its fully electric scooter, AppScooter, which has GPS, 4G connectivity, and Android app support. 
 In addition, the Etergo team will join Ola Electric as part of the deal, according to a statement. 
 Ola said it plans to build a suite of electric and smart mobility solutions globally. It also looks to begin production work for its own EVs this year and launch its first scooter in 2021. 
 The company is currently running several pilots to deploy EVs and charging solutions across cities in India. However, Ola Electric said it will keep its focus on two- and three-wheelers for now. 
 Ola’s electric vehicle arm started running these pilots in India last year in cooperation with local power distribution companies. It raised  US$57.7 million  in March 2019 as part of its series A round, with SoftBank following up with a  US$250 million  injection later in July.

648180,Is RBF an alternative to traditional loans and venture capital?," The era of “move fast and break things” looks to be over. Once conducive to  unicorns  and  venture capitalists with a kingmaker bent , this high-growth and high-risk mentality is losing appeal among business owners amid  decreasing stock prices  and the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Some entrepreneurs like Treman Singh Ahluwalia prefer to take a slower but steadier path to growth. He owns  Sugar Watchers , an Indian company that produces low-GI (glycemic index) variations of food staples such as rice and sells them online. 
 Ahluwalia is aiming to raise money from investors once his company reaches the right valuation. Until then, he’s relying on revenue-based financing (RBF), an alternative type of loan that’s paid back with a percentage of the borrower’s gross revenue, to help the business grow.

 The RBF provider may require borrowers to pay a flat fee, which is equivalent to a percentage of the loan amount. For example, a business might take a US$10,000 advance that incurs a flat fee of 10%. It will have to pay back a total of US$11,000. 
 If the startup achieves a revenue of US$20,000 in the first month, it pays US$2,000, leaving a balance of US$9,000. The company will continue to pay out a percentage of its revenue until the loan is fully paid. 
 Businesses end up repaying less during challenging situations. 
 Unlike in the West, RBF isn’t a popular method of raising capital in Asia, according to Jeffrey Liu, co-founder and CEO of  Jenfi , a Singapore-based provider of such financing. But He believes that might change in the aftermath of Covid-19. 
 “RBF ties repayment to a share of revenue, which means businesses end up repaying less during challenging situations, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic,” he explains. “We are seeing increased demand for our product given the pullback from traditional lenders and the pent-up demand for SMEs.”

 India-based fintech firm  GetVantage  is also seeing soaring demand for such financing, company founder and CEO Bhavik Vasa says. In the past two months, as Covid-19 pushed businesses to boost their digital presence, the firm, which provides RBF loans for startups spending on digital marketing, cloud hosting, and digital infrastructure, has seen a 70% uptick in applications. 
 Ahluwalia also believes RBF will soon gain traction as it’s attractive to business owners who seek cash without getting equity investors involved. Sugar Watchers currently obtains funds through GetVantage, which claims to be the first in India to offer this form of lending. 
 How RBF works 
 To apply for RBF, businesses need to show positive operating margins, enabling loan providers to evaluate borrowers based on future potential earnings rather than operating history. Companies don’t need to provide collateral or sit through months of investor due diligence. 
 RBF providers with fintech platforms process applications and disburse funds quickly.  Flywheel Financing , a Singapore-based startup founded in 2019, can do it within 72 hours. 
 Lenders like GetVantage take between 4% and 12% of gross revenue, depending on the loan amount and tenure. “If you’re doing good business and operating margin is positive, you shouldn’t have to take a long tenure loan,” says Vasa. For that reason, they only accept a maximum funding tenure of one year. 
 Vasa declined to share GetVantage’s flat fee but said that the company provides loan amounts of US$10,000 to US$100,000, which can typically be paid back over six to 10 months.

 Jenfi’s flat-fee ranges from 5% to 25%, depending on the size of the overall advance. It takes revenue percentage of as low as 1% up to as high as 30%, and tenures may last from three to 12 months, with existing borrowers’ tenure averaging five months. “In general, higher-margin businesses such as software companies are able to support higher revenue share,” says Liu. 
 Flywheel, meanwhile, takes a fixed fee of 6% to 12% to be paid over six months, according to its website. It provides financing equivalent of up to twice the borrower’s monthly recurring revenue. 
 Due to the nature of the loans, RBF firms lend only to revenue-generating companies. That means many seed-stage startups can’t apply because they don’t qualify. 
 Tracking how the loan is spent 
 “Companies that generate consistent monthly revenue with active marketing and growth spend are suitable for revenue-based financing,” says Jenfi’s Liu. 
 GetVantage, for example, requires that businesses hit at least US$10,000 to US$15,000 worth of digital spending per month. 
 In addition, GetVantage and Jenfi limit the purpose of the loans. GetVantage funds digital expenses that are related to business growth such as online advertising or purchasing additional server space. 
 Vasa points out that narrowing the purpose of the funds to digital spending helps investors minimize the risk of non-payment. They know that their funds will be used for activities that directly drive growth, such as advertising. 
 The ability to view the borrower’s digital spends also helps them manage risk and identify a business’ potential for future funding. 
 
  How Stripe Capital works / Screengrab from Stripe 
 
 To track these, fintech RBF firms use an application programming interface (API) to link their platform with their clients’ accounts. For instance, they would be granted viewing rights to the company’s accounting software, as well as Facebook and Google ad platforms, or Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts. 
 Similarly, Jenfi, which joined YCombinator’s accelerator program early this year, offers funds specifically for digital marketing expenditures and taps “digitally-enabled businesses.” These may be online like ecommerce players, or offline, such as retailers and service providers. 
 Flywheel, on the other hand, focuses on online businesses but allows them to use the funds for other purposes such as payroll, inventory purchasing, and hiring. 
 Borrowers also have to sync their payment gateways such as PayPal with the financing platform. That way, with each payment they receive, a percentage of revenue is immediately paid to the financing platform. That’s exactly how  Stripe Capital , the RBF arm of global payment processor Stripe, works. 
 A new asset class 
 GetVantage also welcomes investors who want to lend to small and medium-sized enterprises through its platform. “We are creating a new asset class: funding as revenue-based financing,” he says. This allows investors to diversify their investment strategy. 
 Compared to equity funding, these investors benefit from smaller but more frequent returns. Investors can get their money back – and then some – within shorter periods compared to equity investing, which typically takes several years to see returns, depending on when the startup goes public. 
 “Our model is more about the higher rotation of capital, not about the percentage of return,” says GetVantage’s Vasa. 
 This doesn’t apply to all RBF providers, though, especially those that don’t operate as platform-based, fintech-first firms. 
 Short-term loans aren’t the only type of RBF available. For instance,  Flexible Capital Fund  gives out loans that typically have a maturity date of five to seven years. Since it began operations in 2011, Flex Fund has provided a total of US$5 million in funding to 16 companies, according to CEO Janice St. Onge. 
 “Once they meet the multiple (e.g. ,2X our money), the investment is considered paid in full. If they pay off early, it positively impacts our internal rate of return. If they don’t pay off by maturity date, the lump sum remaining on the multiple is due,” she explains. 
 Not for everyone 
 Ahluwalia of Sugar Watchers believes that RBF is suitable for business owners who have conservative goals in the near term and who don’t want to give away any equity or open up board seats to more investors. 
 Sugar Watchers spends around US$4,000 to US$5,000 a month on Amazon and BigBasket, an online grocery in India. It’s taking out a 12-month loan from GetVantage. 
 St. Onge says that RBF is a “fairer” option for both investors and businesses. “With RBF, investors can fund a wider variety of companies that don’t need to scale and have unbridled growth to get a fair return.” 
 While these factors may be attractive to some business owners, they could discourage others. RBF can be expensive, especially when you’re paying out as much as 12% to 30% of your monthly gross revenue.

 However, Vasa believes that GetVantage’s data-driven business model also benefits founders. The company’s platform analyzes the borrower’s digital spending upon application, eliminating biases based on connections and perceptions of founders. For business owners who don’t have friends in high places, that’s certainly a plus factor. 
 Vasa thinks data-driven funding is on the rise, along with purpose-specific financing. The Covid-19 crisis will only accelerate this trend as investors look for more conservative investments and businesses to avoid having debts on their books for a long time. 
 GetVantage aims to fund more than 200 startups and digital businesses in India over the next two to three years, according to Vasa. It’s also eyeing Southeast Asia for future expansion, making the company a potential competitor for Jenfi and FlyWheel. 
 SMEs account for  between 89% and 99%  of total enterprises in the ASEAN, so GetVantage’s plan makes sense.

 In five ASEAN countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand – less than 60% of SMEs have access to bank loans and around 50% are unserved or underserved by financial institutions, according to professional services firm  Deloitte . 
 Jenfi aims to capture 7.5 million SMEs in Southeast Asia over the next five to 10 years, with a focus on digitally enabled businesses. It has disbursed over S$1.4 million to date, with a cumulative monthly growth rate of 83% over the past four months. 
 RBF will become a fixture in the industry in Asia, contends Jenfi’s Liu. “This is essentially a new asset class that will become a permanent option for businesses to consider when thinking about how to grow their business without diluting their equity,” he says.

648170,How Covid-19 will change the future of work," The Covid-19 pandemic has made today’s already complex business environment even more complicated. As businesses around the world adapt to a new normal – and with the virus seemingly here for the long haul – the future of work is set to change. 
 To find out how this affects businesses,  Tech in Asia  held a virtual panel discussion with Nirupam Das (chief information officer, Liberty Insurance), Felix Leong (APAC director, Vonage), and Maria Li (chief operating officer, Tech in Asia) on May 20. 
 The panel shared and reflected on the shifting trends around the future of work, how employees and customer interactions would change post-pandemic, and tips on how leaders can future-proof their companies during these uncertain times. 
 The discussion centered around how leaders can take a structured, thoughtful approach across three key categories: talent, technology, and customers and external stakeholders. 
 Talent 
 Talent is crucial in any business. That’s why it’s important for leaders to think through their team structure first and foremost. More specifically, they must also weigh how people and teams should be organized and how remote teams can be managed. 
 In the absence of in-person interactions in a remote working setup, it is also significant to maintain corporate culture, keep employee morale up, and cultivate training for staff. 
 Technology 
 As companies start up their businesses once more, they must ascertain that they have the right tools to support both internal and external collaborations and workflows (e.g., customer relationship management platforms and file sharing software), as well as the right tools to secure their enterprise. 
 On this note, Liberty Insurance’s Das advised companies to invest in building their technology stack. For instance, Liberty Insurance saw the crisis as an opportunity to implement the digital processes that they had been sitting on for a while. 
 When the coronavirus outbreak began, it started off with tactical investments, and as the virus spread, it gradually spent more on remote technology. Das said he expects to see an increased demand for digital processes even after the pandemic. 
 Customers and external stakeholders 
 Needless to say, companies are on their toes during this period, thinking of ways to sustain their businesses. 
 But when it comes to dealing with customers, the panel agreed on a few fundamentals: implementing clear digital communication pathways with customers and vendors/partners and increasing company visibility and improving efficiency. With this digitization comes the need to track relevant data points that could have an impact on the business and subsequently translating this data into actionable insights even after Covid-19. 
 Companies with a solid technology stack would already have an advantage and should start thinking about how they can change the customer experience. According to Vonage’s Leong, a good example for this is Netflix Party, the video-streaming platform’s new feature that allows friends and families to watch Netflix shows together even if they’re physically apart. 
 Businesses must also be proactive rather than reactive, he said, especially during these challenging times. It is crucial to digitize processes and think of alternate revenue streams, as well as consider how these changes can run parallel with your business’ current model after the situation normalizes. 
 Upcoming events 
 After the panel discussion, the event concluded with a series of breakout sessions, where participants were divided into small groups based on the three categories to further exchange their insights and opinions on how their businesses are dealing with the current situation. 
 Coming up, we have a series of events, including our first-ever Product Development Conference in July.

648036,The great advertising reset: Mobile paves the way in the post-pandemic era," At the end of last year, when the novel coronavirus was still barely a blip on the radar, I published a series of  2020 predictions for the Asia-Pacific region , with a rather ominous forecast topping the list: 
 “Asia Pacific could be hit with its first massive global-scale data breach – possibly coming from a unicorn or decacorn. This will be too big to sweep under the rug that companies will finally take privacy and security seriously. Governments will take action.” 
 
  Photo credit: Pixabay 
 
 Even though data breaches are still a troubling issue, I might as well have been referring to a global pandemic: It’s massive in scale, it can’t be ignored, and governments are taking action to address it. 
 We are dealing with what is seen as one of the worst economic downturns in history, which has brought substantial uncertainty to people’s lives and livelihoods. 
 For those of us in marketing technology, we are entering “the Great Reset.” 
 With sales mostly flat and stocks oscillating, companies are opening war rooms with only one agenda written on the whiteboard: To conserve cash. Realistically, it is not uncommon for marketers to have minimal authority in this setting; I would even wager that they seldom get invited into the room in the first place. 
 Still, marketers are instinctively primed to solve problems just as they are to spend budgets. There needs to be a recalibration of annual marketing plans but also a forging of a new strategic construct. I believe that from here on out, if it wasn’t already clear, the solution lies in the realm of mobile. 
 Less focus on traditional media 
 Major Asian governments have aggressively upgraded their infrastructures over the years, and as countries are currently in lockdown, people are spending a majority of their time on their digital devices. 
  Data from Statista  forecast that by 2021, China’s use of digital platforms will far outstrip its consumption of traditional media, with daily average use predicted to clock in at 4.5 hours vs. 2.6 hours, respectively. 
 Not surprisingly, in the age of Covid-19, this usage behavior has become glaringly reflective of trends around marketing spend. Budgets have been  drastically cut , with traditional advertising campaigns and ad agencies expected to bear the brunt. 
 There needs to be less of a discussion around this now, as practically all reports and studies point to a clear future: Traditional media will survive, but in a post-pandemic world, it should occupy only a thin line item budget. 
 Beware of “instant gratification” budget cuts 
 Having said that, companies should not take the easy way out and simply cut their marketing budgets, as this would only be a short-term fix. 
 Make no mistake about it: A recession is looming and consumers are reluctant to dig into their pockets any deeper than they should. But this must not discourage marketers. 
 Now more than ever, they should amp up or, at the very least, maintain their marketing pressure. 
 In  his article  “Marketing your way through a recession,” professor John Quelch of Harvard Business School could not have conveyed this more succinctly: “Brands that increase advertising during a time of crisis, when competitors are cutting back, can improve market share and return on investment [as well as] lower cost than during good economic times.” 
 APAC driving seismic shifts in global marketing spend and tech innovation 
 But with every geographic and industry vertical going through these challenging times, the adage “Continue spending your budgets” may not suffice. As this is the first time in our lifetimes that we’re experiencing a crisis of this magnitude, businesses are increasingly looking for benchmarks and places from where they can draw real success stories. 
 I say, look no further than APAC, specifically China. 
 During the Lunar New Year, when most of China was on lockdown, Bytedance’s video platforms premiered the blockbuster   Lost in Russia .  It was viewed by an estimated 600 million people on their mobile phones at the time. 
 If the global stage hasn’t fully realized it yet, China is a tremendously skillful and agile innovator, turning conventional models and modes of entertainment into juggernauts of digital consumption. 
 Attribution platform AppsFlyer made a bold forecast earlier this year that global app install ad spend would more than double to  US$118 billion  in 2022, with APAC commanding the lion’s share (US$61.1 billion) due to the mega markets of China, India, Indonesia, and Japan. 
 Admittedly, these projections had been made before Covid-19 struck, and no adjustment has been done to these figures yet despite the obvious economic challenges. 
 They merely show that in this genuinely mobile-first – and often mobile-only – region, while there may be unanticipated challenges, growth opportunities will always abound. ",Ronen Mense,0,4,"[(0, 0.9998452)]",['app'],"['Russia', 'Lost', 'India', 'Japan', 'Indonesia', 'China']"
648152,GoBear nets $17m to further expand its financial services platform," Singapore-based fintech company  GoBear  announced that it has secured US$17 million from Dutch venture capital firm Walvis Participaties and life insurance company Aegon NV. 
 According to GoBear, the new funds will go into further expanding its financial services platform across three pillars: an online financial supermarket, digital insurance brokerage, and digital lending.

 Since the end of last year, the startup claims to have seen a positive gross margin due to growth across its insurance and lending verticals. In the last three months, its digital insurance brokerage segment saw a 52% increase in average order value amid Covid-19, GoBear said. 
 It also launched a white-label travel insurance product called Go Travel, launched in collaboration with insurer Chubb, as well as Travel Buddy with financial services company Allianz. 
 Early this month, GoBear said it  acquired  AsiaKredit, an end-to-end digital consumer lender, to reinforce its digital lending business. 
 In line with its growth strategy, GoBear appointed Valeriy Gasratov as chief information technology officer, Jinnee Lim as chief strategy officer, and Mike Singh from AsiaKredit as chief lending officer. 
 Launched in 2015 as a metasearch engine, GoBear has grown into a one-stop financial services platform to offer financial know-how, tools, and products.

648155,Digital yuan not set for launch albeit upcoming trials," China still has no timetable for launching its much-hyped sovereign digital currency, with limited public trials that will begin soon just “routine parts of the research and development process,” China’s central bank governor said.

 People’s Bank of China chief Yi Gang said China had “basically completed” the top-level design, standard setting, research on functions, and integration tests of the digital yuan. 
 But Yi cautioned that the central bank still needed more time to verify “the reliability of theories, stability of the system, usability of its functions, convenience of the process, applicability in different sites, as well as the ability to control risks.” 
 “[The tests] don’t mean the official launch of a digital yuan” and “there’s no timetable for an official launch,” Yi said in an interview published by the central bank publication,  China Finance , on Tuesday. 
 Speculation of an imminent launch of China’s sovereign digital currency heated up in April after a screenshot of the user interface for the digital yuan emerged. 
 At the same time, Chinese media reported that trials would start in a district in the Western city of Suzhou as well as in the city of Xiong’an in Hebei province with a dozen local businesses, including American chains Starbucks, McDonald’s, and Subway, reportedly included in the pilot program involving small transactions. 
 But Yi’s latest comments poured cold water on expectations that China’s sovereign digital currency would be launched soon, while they will also temper theories that Beijing could use the digital form of the yuan to undermine the US dollar. 
 Yi confirmed that China had approved a number of state-owned banks and financial institutions to conduct research on the digital yuan at the end of 2017 and that “internal closed pilot tests” are currently being conducted in Shenzhen, Suzhou, Xiong’an, Chengdu, and will also take place later at the sites for the 2020 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing. 
 He added that China’s sovereign digital currency would be a digitalized form of cash that will be able to be used in “retail payments.” 
 The Chinese government work report delivered to the National People’s Congress by Premier Li Keqiang last week, though, did not mention China’s sovereign digital currency plan, a sign that the project is not at the top of Beijing’s agenda. 
 China was the first major economy to study the application of a sovereign digital currency having started work on the project in 2014. 
 At the same time, the Chinese government has also continued to crack down on the trading of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, regarding them as risks to the country’s financial stability. 
 Libra was originally designed to be anchored by a basket of currencies, although Facebook announced in April that it would create multiple digital units tied to individual currencies to clear international regulatory obstacles.

648127,East Ventures backs big data startup built by former Traveloka execs,"  Bonza , an Indonesian big data analysis startup that aims to bridge the gap between AI research and its real-life implementation, has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding from East Ventures. 
 The company, founded just this year, will use the fresh funds to further develop its tech and product as well as expand its operations.

 Bonza was built by Philip Thomas and Elsa Chandra who were previously the data science lead and an investment senior executive, respectively, at Indonesian travel unicorn Traveloka. Their startup helps customers bring together sources of structured and unstructured data into a single source of truth. The data is then used to build and deploy AI and machine learning solutions for decisions at scale. 
 The startup aims to build a product that can be used by everyone in a company – from data analysts to C-suite executives – to make decisions, according to a statement. 
 In the meantime, Bonza is using its expertise to help fight the spread of Covid-19. It has introduced the Effective Reproduction Number (Rt) model to help the Indonesian government measure the growth rate of virus transmission across the archipelago. 
 Policymakers can use the model as a metric to create plans and measure the effectiveness of pandemic control measures such as large-scale social restrictions, according to a statement. The national government hopes to reopen the economy by June. 
 An Rt number that’s greater than one indicates that on average, every infectious person transmits the virus to more than one individual and that more Covid-19 cases may appear in their area. An Rt lower than one means that on average, every carrier transmits the virus to less than one person and infections may decrease until the transmission stops. 
 According to Bonza, Indonesia has an Rt of 1.43 as of May 24, the highest number compared to Singapore (1.22), Malaysia (1.22), the Philippines (0.79), Vietnam (0.33), and Thailand (0.32). As of this writing, Indonesia has recorded more than 22,700 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with over 1,300 deaths.

648110,Why Kopi Kenangan leads Indonesia’s VC-backed coffee wars," A couple of years into Indonesia’s coffee wars, and one company appears to have separated itself from the pack. 
 Kopi Kenangan’s recent  series B round , which was led by Sequoia Capital, brings its total disclosed funding to US$137 million. That’s miles ahead of Fore Coffee, its fellow venture-backed competitor, which has  raised US$9.5 million  to date. Kopi Kenangan expects to operate 500 stores by the end of the year, with an eye on international expansion post-pandemic.

 There are several factors behind Kopi Kenangan’s seemingly quick rise to the top. It sells affordable beverages geared towards the mass market and has solid economics, especially when it comes to rent. And unlike many new tech ventures, it’s based on a model that’s proven to be profitable. 
 But will that growth last? The consumer food and beverage (F&amp;B) business can be fickle, and it’s a competitive space: Many other players are competing for the same demographic, which indicates how low the barriers to entry are. Things might also change once the company leaves the hypergrowth stage. 
 Rent is a crucial factor 
 
  Data from Kopi Kenangan 
 
 Based on financial data provided by Kopi Kenangan, the company’s profit margins at the store level is from 34% to 42% compared to 33% to 36% for a typical global coffee chain. 
 Kopi Kenangan hit these numbers even if its cost of goods sold is higher, as it aims to provide quality beverages at lower prices. In comparison, many global chains in Indonesia operate on a franchise model, where the parent company licenses its brand and other assets to franchisees in exchange for a fee (generally around 7% to 10% of revenue). 
 Franchising is popular among F&amp;B brands seeking to expand quickly, but having ample venture capital funding lets Kopi Kenangan bypass this method. CEO Edward Tirtanata says the company currently has no plans to adopt the model. 
 On the other hand, established global chains also offer food and merchandise, which help beef up the bottom line. Kopi Kenangan is planning to go into food – primarily grab-and-go snacks like bread or  desserts  – and already started selling merchandise like t-shirts and coffee tumblers. 
 “If you compare us to legacy brands, the missing revenue mix is actually the food, and hopefully we can bridge that gap with incumbent brands by introducing snacks,” Tirtanata says. “It can create double-digit sales growth.”

 An even more crucial factor appears to be rent. A VC from a major regional firm that hasn’t invested in coffee says that if rental costs are not managed well, it can kill a coffee shop outright. 
 “Starbucks is a real estate play,” he notes. “That’s why their coffee is expensive – otherwise, they can’t afford a big, fancy place in a strategic location.” 
 This ties in with the  “third place”  concept popularized by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, where the space becomes a venue where customers can work or socialize outside of the home and office. 
 In contrast, majority of Kopi Kenangan’s outlets are small, grab-and-go stalls inspired in part by bubble tea brands. Tirtanata says that rent makes up 6% to 8% of the company’s revenue, which is roughly half of an international chain like Starbucks or Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf (15%). By not providing seating space, Kopi Kenangan can offer cheaper beverage prices, thus passing on the rental savings to the customer. 
 Rent is one area where Kopi Kenangan and Fore Coffee have different approaches. While Fore Coffee also emphasizes the tech-enabled, grab-and-go model, it does offer seating areas in many of its outlets – much more so than Kopi Kenangan, Tirtanata says. 
 
  A Fore Coffee outlet in Jakarta / Photo credit: Fore Coffee 
 
 Though he doesn’t know Fore Coffee’s internal numbers, Tirtanata deduces that the larger spaces could mean rent might add up to a double-digit percentage of revenue. 
 “It’s not necessarily a bad thing, [but] just a different choice,” he says. “If they get higher revenue because of that bigger space, then maybe it’s a good thing as well.” 
 However, Fore Coffee chief executive Elisa Suteja says that only 10% of its outlets have a sizable seating space. 
 The Covid-19 pandemic and Jakarta’s large-scale social restrictions have significantly affected the F&amp;B industry, including both players. Fore Coffee  permanently shuttered  16 stores in April and temporarily closed another 45 during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, while Kopi Kenangan has  temporarily shut down  or reduced the hours of around 150 outlets – about half of its total stores. 
 “The crisis’ impact on any F&amp;B retail business is huge,” Suteja says. “Therefore, I don’t see closing some outlets as a bad thing. It is a business decision that has to be taken.” 
 Pricing and market positioning 
 Rent aside, an industry source with knowledge of Kopi Kenangan’s operations says that another point of comparison is pricing and market positioning. 
 Early on, Fore Coffee had a more  premium market positioning , offering primarily espresso-based drinks like Americanos and lattes. In June 2019, a cup of Fore Coffee’s iced Americano cost 35,000 rupiah (US$2.36) – roughly the same price as Starbucks. It also sells teas from Singapore’s TWG brand, while some of its first stores were located in Jakarta’s upscale areas like Senopati and the Plaza Indonesia mall. 
 Kopi Kenangan and many other brands, on the other hand, serve milk coffee, a homegrown concoction of coffee, milk, and palm sugar (locally known as  gula aren  or  gula melaka ). 
 “Is [Fore Coffee] really a daily coffee for the masses?” asks the industry source. 
 The VC source agrees, saying that Fore Coffee’s market positioning pits it against Starbucks and  third-wave coffee shops  instead of Kopi Kenangan and the like. 
 Customers in the premium segment are spoiled for choice, even when it comes to online orders. GoFood and GrabFood have made products from Starbucks and third-wave coffee shops widely available for delivery.

 There also hasn’t been a strong enough indication that Fore Coffee is luring customers away from these brands at a sufficient scale. Meanwhile, Kopi Kenangan’s demographic didn’t have an incumbent brand to begin with. Toko Kopi Tuku, which is widely considered a pioneer in the milk coffee trend, is only two years older than Kopi Kenangan. 
 Fore Coffee has since made adjustments that bring itself closer to Kopi Kenangan in terms of pricing and market positioning. A cup of iced Americano now costs 22,000 rupiah (US$1.49), marking a 40% drop from its initial pricing. But that’s still slightly more expensive than what Kopi Kenangan charges for its signature milk coffee – 18,000 rupiah or US$1.22 – and Americanos – 15,000 rupiah or US$1. 
 Fore Coffee also launched a palm sugar latte in September 2019, which is essentially its version of the local-style milk coffee. On its GoFood page, the company says this beverage is its most popular. 
 But some things are harder to change than others. “Even the coffee cups are of good quality and are well-designed,” says the VC source. “At those prices, how much margins are they making?” 
 Kopi Kenangan has benefited as well from being around longer. It opened its first outlet in August 2017, more than a year before raising its seed funding from Alpha JWC Ventures.

 At the time of its seed funding, “Kopi Kenangan had operated for roughly a year as a profitable business, with many loyal fans,” says the industry source. He adds that the founder’s experience – Tirtanata previously launched an artisanal tea lounge called Lewis and Carroll, which has multiple locations in Jakarta – is reflected in the quality and consistency of Kopi Kenangan’s products. 
 Tirtanata is a “foodpreneur,” so “he’s very particular about quality, recipes, and ingredients,” the industry source explains. 
 Kopi Kenangan is even older than China’s Luckin Coffee, which only opened its first stores in January 2018. Tirtanata had said in a  previous interview  that Luckin Coffee was an inspiration for Kopi Kenangan to fundraise, but not to start the company. 
 In addition, Luckin Coffee may not be the best example for Indonesia’s coffee players. While Tirtanata admires the Chinese company’s business model, he regrets the recent troubles, which he believes is caused by a “governance issue.” That said, coffee as a beverage is not as culturally ingrained in China as it is in Indonesia, which is one of the biggest  producers  and  consumers  of coffee globally. 
 Can this last? 
 Unlike many new tech ventures, the model for a coffee chain business already exists and is already proven. VCs can therefore directly invest in expansion, which Tirtanata says is an important reason behind Kopi Kenangan’s appeal among investors and how it has managed to raise a large amount of funding amid the Covid-19 crisis. 
 “VCs invest in growth, and after WeWork’s implosion, VCs invest in profitable growth. After the coronavirus, VCs [want to] invest in companies that have a very long runway,” he says. “Essentially, we don’t burn cash – even during the pandemic we don’t burn that much cash. We have a long runway where VCs know there’s no solvency or going concern issues.” 
 The VC source concurs with Tirtanata’s view. “What Kopi Kenangan has done right is that they were able to scale profitably, in the sense that each outlet is profitable,” he says. “They can identify locations with good traffic very well, so their strategy to scale has been impressive.” 
 Landing Sequoia Capital as an investor has become a game-changer, the source adds, as it validates the coffee space as a viable business and investment. The VC firm previously invested US$20 million in Indian coffee chain Cafe Coffee Day before exiting after six years in 2012.

 That said, consumer F&amp;B is a notoriously volatile space, and the question is whether Kopi Kenangan can sustain the business. It’s often easier for business-to-consumer startups to become profitable because that’s expected in a consumer play, but a lot of times they don’t survive because competition is intense. 
 “You’re competing in the beverage category, not just coffee,” the VC source points out. “There are a lot of substitutes in the market, like bubble tea.” 
 The consumer coffee space also has really low barriers to entry, which limits competitive advantage. When the demand picks up at this rate, similar brands will start popping up. 
 “Maybe Kopi Kenangan can [become a first mover] in the smaller-tier cities, but the competitive advantage from that is also limited – it doesn’t mean that other brands cannot do that as well,” the VC source says. “As more competition comes in, and if there are other players [making] better coffee, customers can switch to another brand.” 
 Perhaps this explains why Kopi Kenangan  emphasizes strong branding , though once the high-growth stage is over, there’s always a chance that the company will be benchmarked like other players in the market. The VC source cites co-working as an example: Once the growth started to plateau, these companies started to be valued like a traditional real estate business instead of a high-growth tech play. 
 Indeed, there are many other brands in Indonesia similar to Kopi Kenangan with sizable scale. Janji Jiwa, for instance, has over 700 outlets (90% of which are franchised), while Kedai Kopi Kulo had close to 200 outlets by mid-2019. Kopi Kenangan says it currently has 324 stores across Indonesia. 
 Tirtanata says that acquiring one of these players is not something Kopi Kenangan is actively pursuing. Instead, the company is looking to expand its product mix through the possible acquisition of a snack brand.

 There’s also no reason why any of Kopi Kenangan’s competitors can’t go the tech-enabled route and raise VC funding. But the VC source thinks that it comes down to the different drives of each founder. 
 “When you raise money, you’re giving out ownership in your company, so for them it’s like, ‘Do I want to? Do I need to?’” he says. “Do I care about being the biggest coffee brand in Indonesia or do I just want to own 50 outlets that are profitable?” 
 Still, the VC source says he likes the coffee space personally, even if his firm hasn’t made an investment there. “It’s still a wildcard for me, but the good thing is that investors won’t lose money,” he explains. 
 Kopi Kenangan’s profitability may mean more efficient use of capital – even though investors invest, the company may not even use much of their cash. This contrasts with how a lot of tech companies continuously raise funds without making money. 
 “I’m just concerned about barriers of entry, brand sustainability, brand fatigue – stuff like that,” the VC source says. But all things considered, “it’s a stable investment for a consumer business.” ",Putra Muskita,0,10,"[(0, 0.69866735), (2, 0.3012949)]","['VC', 'GrabFood', 'rupiah', 'Starbucks', 'Americanos', 'Carroll', 'WeWork', 'GoFood']","['Senopati', 'Singapore', 'Indonesia', 'China', 'Jakarta']"
648085,FabHotels cuts pay to keep business viable," FabHotels has implemented pay cuts in an attempt to stop losing money as the Covid-19 pandemic weighs on the hospitality business. 
 The decision was made due to a “worsening business environment,” co-founder Vaibhav Aggarwal tells  Tech in Asia . “We had to take these unfortunate tough calls to keep business viable and to protect the interests of the larger organization,” he says. 
 Employees costing the company less than US$331 have taken a 15% pay cut, while those costing higher have taken a 20% cut. FabHotels’ two co-founders have also agreed to slash their salaries by 50%. 
 
  FabHotels co-founder Vaibhav Aggarwal 
 
 In March, FabHotels let go of some 120 employees, but Aggarwal says the move was performance-related. 
 The budget hotel aggregator joins a slew of startups that have implemented pay cuts, furloughed staff, or laid off employees. Startups were forced to focus on profitability in the wake of increased investor scrutiny following the WeWork  fiasco  in October 2019. But the path to profitability has been difficult due to Covid-19 and the resulting business downturn. 
 FabHotels’ cost-cutting moves have less to do with extending the runway and more to do with breaking even at the net profit level within the next 12 to 15 months. The company is “sufficiently well-capitalized” to achieve that by the early part of the next financial year, Aggarwal says. 
 “Our industry is obviously in direct line of fire, and we are seeing a significant hit on our occupancies,” he says explaining the need for pay cuts. The startup has also been able to  keep gross margins stable  at 20%. 
 As India eases its lockdown measures, the accommodation sector is seeing demand from stranded corporate employees, medical staff, and international and domestic travelers, says Aggarwal. The government requires all travelers to self-isolate as they enter India or move between states. 
 Meanwhile, FabHotels has launched cleaning and disinfecting initiatives such as “100% Safe Place to Stay” across its properties. These initiatives are in line with what four- and five-star hotels are undertaking, Aggarwal claims.

 FabHotels is not alone in cutting salaries. 
 Last month, rival and market leader Oyo asked its employees  to take a 25% pay cut  after reportedly furloughing thousands of staff. The SoftBank-backed startup operates around the world, with a significant presence in India and Asia Pacific. The hotel industry in these regions are bearing the brunt of the Covid-19 economic fallout. 
 Hotels across Asia Pacific have seen a lackluster performance in the first quarter of 2020, says Govinda Singh, head of hotels and leisure at Colliers. The overall room occupancy and the average daily rate (ADR) fell to 42.1% and a little over US$97, respectively. The ADR was at US$102 in the same quarter a year earlier. The revenue per available room or RevPAR, a standard hotel industry metric, also dropped by about 40% year on year, Singh says.

648100,Meituan posts Q1 loss amid Covid-19 pandemic," Meituan Dianping generated 16.8 billion yuan (US$2.4 billion) in revenue in the first quarter of 2020, a 12.6% decline year on year as the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the firm’s business, causing disruptions to both supply and demand. However, the company still exceeded market expectations of 15.6 billion yuan (US$2.2 billion), sending its shares up to 6.16% at market close. 
 On Monday, the company posted a loss of 1.6 billion yuan (US$221.3 million) for the first quarter ended March 31, following three consecutive profitable quarters.

 Beijing-based Meituan is China’s largest food delivery platform, which also offers travel and hotel bookings. These core businesses were devastated during the pandemic as many restaurants and merchants suspended their businesses and travel restrictions resulted in empty hotels across China during the March quarter. 
 Specifically, revenue from Meituan’s food delivery business fell by 11.4% year on year compared to an 8% year-on-year decline for Alibaba-backed rival Ele.me. The average daily number of food delivery transactions also decreased by 18.2% year on year to 15.1 million. 
 However, Meituan chief financial officer Sharon Cui revealed that daily food delivery order volume has returned to roughly 90% of pre-pandemic levels as of the week of May 11. Although the Covid-19 presented near-term obstacles for the food delivery business, Meituan believes that the health crisis will provoke a broader adoption of food delivery services in the long term, as the average order value increased by 14.4% year on year during the March quarter, the company mentioned on the earnings call. 
 Meanwhile, revenue from the in-store, hotel, and travel segment declined by 31.1% year on year. The segment is likely to take the longest to recover, as consumers are still hesitant to return to offline outlets or book travel arrangements. 
 Meituan warned of continued headwinds in its earnings release: “Moving on to the remaining of 2020, we expect that factors including the ongoing pandemic precautions, consumers’ insufficient confidence in offline consumption activities and the risk of merchants’ closure would continue to have a potential impact on our business performance.” 
 Despite the challenges that may persist for Meituan, CEO Wang Xing told investors on the earnings call that “there are challenges, but Covid-19 is not going to be the end of the world. We’ll keep investing and we’ll keep building.”

 CoinDCX offers fiat-to-crypto services, spot trading, margin trading, and futures trading using a proprietary liquidity aggregation model. It integrates with global exchanges like Binance, Huobi Global, and OKEx. 
 The three-year-old startup said the investment will help support the demand for crypto in India, which has seen a recent uptick after the ban on financial institutions facilitating digital currency transactions was lifted in February this year. 
 Since then, CoinDCX said it saw a 47% increase in trading volumes and a 150% growth in daily active users just in March. 
 It also plans to use the new funds to help drive crypto adoption and push the total number of crypto users in India to 50 million. As part of this initiative, CoinDCX launched Academy, a blockchain and cryptocurrency learning program designed for novice traders. 
 Coinbase Ventures’ investment into CoinDCX comes after the US crypto exchange had started serving Indian customers in April last year. In addition to CoinDCX, Coinbase Ventures have also backed other crypto businesses such as Compound, BlockFi, Etherscan, Securitize, and Messari.

 Now in its second year, the 12-week program will focus on open finance, LongHash said in a statement. It is scheduled to start running today and culminate on a demo day in August. 
 Open finance builds upon the idea of open banking, which is the use of open APIs that enable developers to build services around financial institutions. Open finance goes beyond that, however, by allowing customers to share their data with third-party providers, who will then develop new products suited to fit their needs. 
 With this shift, LongHash said it has tapped industry experts from Ethereum Foundation, Maker, Synthetix, and InstaDApp. It will also be working with Fenbushi Capital, HashKey Capital, Kenetic Capital, and Dragonfly Capital on the investment front. 
 LongHash will then provide the selected startups with modules tailored for strategy formulation, go-to-market execution, and subject matter guidance. 
 Here are the seven startups that form Hatch’s fourth cohort: 
 
 
 CredMark  is a Hong Kong-based firm that equips financial institutions with non-traditional credit data based on blockchain financial history and private data. 
 
 Hashtacs  is a white-label solutions platform in Singapore that helps financial institutions use blockchain for efficient consolidation of records and easier transactions. 
 
 Pravica  is an email and communications software provider in Egypt that offers blockchain-based privacy and security solutions and enables payments via email. 
 
 Puma Browser  is a mobile browser from the US that is private by default. It’s able to stream micropayments to websites via blockchain. 
 
 Statwig  is an India-based SaaS startup for efficient tracking of vaccines and food supply chain using blockchain and IoT. 
 
 Viewbase  is a blockchain analytics platform for cryptocurrency traders that uses proprietary data models. 
 
 Xend  is an African end-to-end merchant solution that includes inventory management, payments, and business intelligence. 
 
 Based in Singapore, LongHash is supported by Fenbushi Capital, HashKey Capital, and Enterprise Singapore. The company said it has raised over US$16 million in funding to date for its portfolio, which includes projects such as Xanpool, AlphaWallet, and Keyless.

648075,Managing your career during the pandemic," While companies are pivoting to survive the economic crisis caused by the pandemic, individuals are also well-advised to make pivots on their own – specifically, career pivots. 
 During this uncertain time, some of us might be thinking of changing careers or finding ways to make our jobs pandemic-proof. So on May 14, Tech in Asia Jobs sat down with Syed Ali Abbas, a prominent C-level HR leader, to ask him some burning questions from an employee’s perspective. 
    
 The industry matters 
 Many of us would like to have a job that can survive even a pandemic, but instead of fixating on a particular position, Syed recommended looking at the industry it belongs to. 
 For example, a customer service representative at a travel agency is likely to get laid off at this time, whereas a similar role at a telecommunications company would receive double the number of calls and therefore remain essential. Having a resilient career today is more sector dependent rather than company- or job-dependent. 
 Industries that have been affected by the pandemic and would likely provide less job security are those that rely on people coming together: co-working spaces, hotels, ride-sharing platforms, and manufacturing plants. On the other hand, those that service people as they maintain distance from each other are booming: ecommerce, food delivery, audio and video streaming, drones, and cryptocurrencies. 
 Developing as an individual 
 Start planning your long-term career goal by asking yourself these questions: What do you want out of life? What can you do with your skills? What makes you happy? 
 Once you have identified your career goals and options, be more proactive than simply taking online courses. Go out and network with people in your chosen industry, or even do a psychometric skill assessment. 
 Should you get the job you applied for (or get to keep your current one), Syed advised to continue working on developing an alternative skill set or a side hustle. This can help you with a planned career switch or in case your position is made redundant. Both contribute to what he called a career portfolio, which can be further developed through upskilling, joining relevant communities, mentoring, and building a personal brand. 
 For the ones who have been laid off, Syed says to stay positive and not lose hope. Start looking at what options you have in your current career track or in other tracks where your alternative skill set can be used. Get yourself out there by commenting on LinkedIn posts, networking, writing a blog, and talking to colleagues and friends. When you spot a job opening, move fast and be less picky. 
 There would likely be more job losses in the coming months, but the key to surviving this period is to continue upskilling and reskilling yourself. Keep an agile mindset and be highly adaptable. Embrace technology trends and have the mentality of being ready to roll up your sleeves and work. 
 We wish you all the best in your career path!

647722,Sustainable banking may be the new vision for financial firms in the post-pandemic future," Despite the upheavals brought by the global financial crisis over a decade ago, trust in traditional banking institutions remains strong – at least, among their core demographic. The struggle for these financial firms has always been to make their established and traditional brand values relevant to a new generation of digitally native customers. 
 But with the rise of virtual banks and other disruptive financial service providers, they face yet even more pressure. Virtual banks have taken the time to understand the particular needs of younger generations and are building a new mobile-first, customer-centric banking experience from the ground up. By the end of 2025, it’s expected that the neo and challenger banking market will be worth over  US$30 billion . 
   
 As 2020 sees the world tilting on its axis once more, both traditional and challenger banks are having to rethink the ways they address what matters most to millennials and Gen Zers who are increasingly making up the majority of their clientele. 
 Baby boomers and Gen X kids grew up with the Cold War and the threat of a nuclear holocaust looming over them, but their children have a different perspective on mutually assured destruction. We’ve seen them march in protest over how the planet they are inheriting from us has already been burned, flooded, and experiencing extreme weather events with escalating rapidity. 
 My 20-year-old son is coming of age with these existential threats and the sentiment that the past generations have failed him and his peers. In fact, he considers it his generation’s duty to put things right. 
 “I think it’s critical to our future for our generation to be sustainably inclined,” he told me recently. “Luckily, I believe most of us think that way, so I’m looking forward to seeing new solutions for cleaning up the mess.” 
 His words reflect a global unease: Climate change is the  biggest concern among those between 13 and 36 years old . Research for this study had been conducted before the onset of the current pandemic – which, ironically, is offering us redemptive optimism, given the measurable improvements in air quality and lowered carbon emissions resulting from quarantine measures that have been implemented around the world. 
 Shortly before all travel ceased, I attended the Singapore Fintech Festival where, for the first time, “sustainable banking” was the core theme.

 An inspiring keynote from Singapore Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung called for the city-state – which accounts for only 0.11% of global carbon emissions – to take the lead in green finance and in mobilizing global capital for the green economy. 
 Singapore’s measures include a green bond scheme, incentives to encourage growth in loans for sustainable initiatives, a program to encourage asset managers who drive green-focused market investment strategies, and collaborations with educational institutions. 
 This messaging is a powerful call to action for my son’s generation and highlights the role that the banking industry can play in the new wave of innovations waiting for us on the other side of the current crisis. 
 But this all hinges on whether these firms will follow through or not. 
 In September 2019, one-third of the world’s banks, which together represent a  US$47 trillion market , signed up for the United Nations’ new  Principles for Responsible Banking  framework. But so far, the levels of their institutional commitment and action vary. 
 Some are educating customers on their alignment with the UN sustainable development goals and are encouraging them to make greener investment decisions. Others are going much further by publicly quantifying their environmental financing goals. For some financial institutions, however, it’s hard to see their initiatives as nothing more than cosmetic “greenwashing” for now. 
 Still, no single bank appears to be placing the health of the environment at the heart of their services and vision for the future. 
 This is a missed opportunity for financial firms that are trying to attract the younger, value-driven, and digitally native generation, especially since open banking standards have made it easier for this demographic to shift providers; in a heartbeat, they can desert legacy providers who don’t understand them. A new way of banking – virtual, paperless, and green by design – could be a game changer. 
 With Singapore following Hong Kong and other Asian markets in accepting applications for virtual banking licenses, the opportunity for the city-state to truly lead the way by encouraging the birth of sustainable banks becomes even more highlighted. 
 Although the world’s markets and consumers are currently taking an unprecedented hiatus, there’s a real opportunity for positive change in the new “post-Corona” world of banking. 
 While no one can predict what the long-term impact of Covid-19 will be on the global economy and behavior, similar crises in the past have led to surges in innovation and progress. Combined with the advances in virtualization, cloud collaboration, and distributed working – plus the immediate evidence of environmental recovery – there has never been greater potential for green banking pioneers to lead the way to a sustainable financial future.

648050,Bytedance employee quits to start app that pays you to read the news," Ever dreamt of being paid to scroll through news? US-based  BuzzBreak  is making that come true by rewarding reading behavior with money, paying out around US$0.10 per article. The company says that its most voracious users have cashed out over US$1,000 in a month – it would’ve taken them at least 10,000 unique article clicks to arrive at that amount. 
 Paying users to consume news may seem like a novelty, but it’s common practice in China.  Qutoutiao , the news app of Tencent, is a good example of this. “For readers, it is always too hard to resist free cash, especially those with time to kill,” says tech investor Chenhao Zhang, who leads  Prometheus Fund . 
 Here’s how BuzzBreak works. It aggregates the news by displaying each article’s headlines and first few sentences to pique users’ interest and make them click on the story. That way, traffic gets redirected to the original news websites and readers get rewarded in points, which they can then cash out.

 BuzzBreak makes money purely through partnering with third-party advertising platforms, which pay it to display ads every three to four articles. The startup says it doesn’t charge news providers a single cent. 
 “We increase their traffic at no cost. That’s because we want more of them to join us, as good content calls for a variety of news sources,” says BuzzBreak co-founder Aron Lyu. “And users stay because of good content.” 
 What’s interesting is that Lyu is a former product manager at Bytedance’s news aggregator TopBuzz. 
 All of the mistakes that were made in TopBuzz, I’ll try to avoid in BuzzBreak. 
 After leaving TopBuzz in May 2018, he joined a company called Partiko to help its CEO Sida Wang and chief technology officer Mike Ma develop a blockchain-based app designed to encourage users to create more content. Partiko started off by rewarding content creators with cryptocurrency. But as Lyu realized that cryptocurrency wasn’t as widely adopted as he hoped, the three of them decided to pivot to giving out money, leading to BuzzBreak. 
 “All of the mistakes that were made in TopBuzz, I will try to avoid in BuzzBreak… that’s why we’re focusing on localization efforts to fit individual countries’ needs,” says Lyu. To elaborate, he says that his startup allows users to cash out their earnings using e-wallet services.

 “TopBuzz was [initially] only offering PayPal as a cash-out option for users, which wasn’t optimal as it had a very low penetration rate in Indonesia and Thailand,” Lyu says. TopBuzz now offers payments through bank transfers as well, though it still  highly recommends  PayPal due to “technical issues.”  Tech in Asia  reached out to Bytedance, but it declined to comment on this story. 
 The differences between TopBuzz and BuzzBreak also extend to their operating models. TopBuzz rewards users for creating content, rather than reading content like BuzzBreak does. TopBuzz also pays US$0.001 per click, a hundredth of what readers would get per click from BuzzBreak. TopBuzz users also have to fulfill more criteria to be awarded the credit, such as ad delivery, the appropriateness of content, and the amount of clicks received over time. These factors make their climb towards getting a full dollar much steeper. 
 TopBuzz has also  received flak  for stipulating that earnings need to reach  at least US$100  before users can withdraw their money. In comparison, Lyu says BuzzBreak has “built trust” with users by allowing them to withdraw “small payouts.” 
 He sees these touches as part of BuzzBreak’s “creative and efficient” efforts to acquire users, as it has “less manpower and funding“ than TopBuzz. 
 And yet Lyu’s app is already beating out TopBuzz in several Asian markets a year after its launch, according to third-party estimates seen by  Tech in Asia . This is despite the fact that the Bytedance news aggregator had a four-year head start. 
 BuzzBreak has achieved this despite being only available to Android users, but Lyu says it’s “launching soon” for Apple users. So far, it’s present in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, where its user base is growing “really fast.” In less than a year, it has reached 3.5 million monthly active users (MAUs). 
 
  BuzzBreak ranks second in the Philippines, third in Thailand, fourth in Indonesia, and eighth in Malaysia (not in the table). 
 
 Data from analytics firm App Annie reaffirms BuzzBreak’s popularity. In three of its markets, BuzzBreak is among the top 10 most downloaded apps in the news and magazines category. 
 BuzzBreak’s top market in terms of popularity appears to be the Philippines, where it beat out the news app of ABS-CBN Corp.,  the country’s largest broadcasting network . Besides being the second most downloaded news app for the first quarter of 2020, BuzzBreak is also the fourth most-used app in the category in terms of MAUs. 
 Like TopBuzz, BuzzBreak curates personalized feeds of news and videos based on users’ browsing behavior. However, Lyu says the company’s algorithms have some catching up to do before it can match Bytedance’s family of apps, which have far more users. 
 Pivoting to popularity 
 Lyu reveals that Southeast Asia wasn’t exactly plan A. “We intended to target the US market, but days after launching BuzzBreak, the team found that there was an ‘influx of users’ in the Philippines,” he says. That led the startup to set its sights on Southeast Asia instead.

 “We feel that most people [in the region] would like to earn some extra money, since income is relatively low,” he explains. “Earning a bubble tea [from using BuzzBreak] may be very appealing to our core users in Southeast Asia, but not so much in more developed countries like Japan and South Korea.” 
 Lyu also says his firm will expand to South America, which has a large population and lacks a “good news aggregator app.” 
 This plan comes after a fresh US$2 million fundraise in May led by ZhenFund, a seed-focused venture fund that’s been as dubbed  China’s greatest angel investor . BuzzBreak also closed a US$600,000 angel round backed by Bertelsmann Asia Investments in late 2019. 
 Already profitable 
 Lyu reveals that BuzzBreak’s advertising-based revenue model is already profitable – a rarity in Southeast Asia’s startup community, which has been  battered by the Covid-19 pandemic , among other factors. 
 “Our company is cost-efficient, as the only expenditure we have stem from running servers, paying salaries, and handing out user rewards,” notes Lyu. BuzzBreak has 10 employees:The majority are engineers based in Beijing while a few are located in the US. 
 Lyu also compares BuzzBreak’s cost structure to logistics company Ninja Van, which requires “a lot of upfront investment” because it needs to own “a lot of physical assets.” 
 “We struck a balance in figuring out a stable system to pay our users in a timely fashion, and also be profitable at the same time,” he adds. 
 Among BuzzBreak’s first partnerships was with Google Admob, which runs video ads on the app. However, the startup ran into unexpected problems on its first day of operations. It had to undergo maintenance due to the  large amount of 4,000 users  that joined the app on its first day of operations. 
 “Some of them don’t read news at all and only watch ads,” wrote BuzzBreak in a post on its blog, saying that the sudden surge in users “triggered Google’s algorithm,” causing its Admob ads to be suspended.

 Here’s the rub with BuzzBreak’s model: As bots inundate online traffic, even  accounting for 60% of it at one point , how does it tackle click fraud? 
 Lyu says that there are definitely users who try to “game” BuzzBreak’s rewards system, which is “always the case for any service that offers any kind of reward.” He adds that the team is “still improving the system to fight fraud.” 
 Current measures include a cap on rewards, though the number is unspecified. Also, users can only log into their account on a single device. BuzzBreak monitors unusual activity patterns as well, tracking suspicious refreshes and clicks and banning users that “abuse” its reward system. 
 Even with these steps in place, stamping out fraud may be hard with just 10 employees. As evident in the  ecommerce  and  ride-hailing  industries, people will try everything to rig the odds in their favor whenever cash incentives are involved. Separating real from bogus user engagement mayprove challenging. 
 [This] is a way to grow the user base, not a way to keep them. 
 Although many users are  singing BuzzBreak’s praises , particularly about its how it helps them earn a quick buck, some are casting a more critical eye. 
 “Worth your time? Technically, no. You will just waste a lot of time playing with this and receive a little in return,” says  a Filipino blogger , although he acknowledges that the app is “legit.” 
 Another reviewer from the Philippines says that the app’s potential is bogged down by its “very low cash-out potential.” As she  observes , “You must have a lot of referrals in order to earn more points.” 
 Responding to the negative reviews, Lyu says that “different people may have different standards,” and it all boils down to “setting the right expectations.” However, he highlights the fact that BuzzBreak has close to a million followers on Facebook, which “speaks for itself” in terms of popularity. 
 According to Prometheus Fund’s Zhang, the model of pay-to-read apps like BuzzBreak and Qutoutiao “won’t work” for major internet companies. As he points out, “It’s a way to grow the user base, not a way to keep them.” 
 Zhang also hints that although BuzzBreak has seen success now, it could struggle to attract investors in the future. “Internet economics requires startups to keep telling exciting stories to attract investors,” he says. “In the end, quality content is quality content. And quality content is costly to provide.” 
 
  BuzzBreak has also drawn similarities to Tencent-backed content app Qutoutiao. / Photo credit: Qutoutiao 
 
 While Lyu agrees that good content is “very costly,” he says that BuzzBreak’s model is lightweight. “We don’t focus on content production. Our main focus is content distribution.” 
 Other than eyeing South America, Lyu tells  Tech in Asia  that BuzzBreak plans to “keep expanding” in Asia as he wants to “incentivize all the people [in the region] with low income to read more.” 
 
  BuzzBreak plans to enter the South American market next. / Photo credit: 123RF 
 
 Zhang says that for BuzzBreak to maintain its growth trajectory in the long term, the firm needs to “keep itself financed.” 
 It’s inevitable that more competitors will pop up. Cashzine, another pay-you-to-read app, is taking off in the same markets as BuzzBreak. Bytedance may also decide to invest more money in TopBuzz. These developments may force BuzzBreak to spend more just to retain its users. 
 Lyu says that BuzzBreak will start advertising its app, sharing that the company has spent “zero dollars” on ads so far. The team is also looking for local partners in the media and payments space to “accelerate growth,” he adds. 
 Sustainability is another concern. “If you lower the amount of money, users will lose interest. But if you raise it, the cost is too high,” said Wei Wuhui, an academic and managing partner at tech-focused venture capital fund SkyChee Ventures, in a   Reuters  report  about Qutoutiao. Fine-tuning incentives in the right way over time may be key to keeping the rate of user growth. 
 BuzzBreak just finished a round, so it isn’t seeking funding right now. But Lyu says the startup wouldn’t turn down investments, especially if they bring resources like local knowledge to the table.

648017,How mobile enterprise tech can help startups weather the Covid-19 crisis," The global Covid-19 pandemic has put startups in  a dire situation , with many struggling to stay afloat. 
 A survey by Startup Genome found that globally,  41% of startups  have only three months of cash runway left, while 74% have seen revenues decrease as a result of the crisis. 
 Startup investment has been affected as well. Funds raised by venture capital firms focusing on Asia fell to  a seven-year low of US$2.2 billion  in the first quarter of 2020, a similar situation that can be seenin the rest of the world. 
 However, the downturn caused by this global crisis is also providing startups with new opportunities to rework and streamline the way they do business. Companies are moving away from paper-based, desk-bound processes and finding new ways to maximize their resources. 
 Digital transformation for a new normal 
 Covid-19 has  accelerated the rate  at which companies embark on digital transformation, as working from home becomes  the new normal . 
 Working remotely under quarantine restrictions makes processing paper forms, mailing physical invoices to customers, and accessing documents stored in an office filing cabinet difficult, even impossible. Companies have been forced to move away from paper-based systems, using business management tools to take operations online and establish an effective “nerve center”.

 Enterprise management tools are one of the most effective ways for startups to undergo a digital transformation, as they are able to streamline and take online many backend office processes such as accounting, invoicing and payroll. 
 The use of business management software is on the rise in Asia. The Asia-Pacific enterprise software market was  valued at US$9,669 million  in 2018, and in 2019, companies in the region were expected to spend at least  $30 million  on such solutions. 
 Additionally, there has been an upward trend of companies  turning towards cloud-based enterprise management solutions  in recent years – a pattern that will likely hold, given that the pandemic will still have employees working remotely in the foreseeable future. 
 Challenges of building a “nerve center” 
 There are  many benefits  to using business management tools, such as cutting down operational costs, having better resource management, and improving productivity. 
 But adopting new tools is tricky.  Less than 30% of companies  that undertake digital transformation projects succeed, as businesses face  challenges  in implementing new processes and training people to use unfamiliar software. If not done well, such projects can end up costing companies a lot of money – with nothing to show for it. 
 While innovative software can help startups resolve problems in their invoicing, accounting, and payroll processes, companies usually need several programs working together in order to benefit from adopting these technologies. 
 “The irony of the business process is that you need [to have] everything [first] before you have anything,” says Shashank Dixit, the CEO of cloud-based business software solutions provider  Deskera . 
 Take, for example, the payroll process. If a startup purchases a generic payroll system, it may not be able to account for factors such as taxes or benefits. This means the company would need to either do the accounting manually, which defeats the purpose of having a payroll system, or purchase an additional application that can integrate such information into their payroll process. 
 These applications are often expensive as well, making them inaccessible to smaller companies. 
 Making enterprise tech accessible 
 To address the gap in the market for affordable enterprise management solutions, Deskera launched the  mobile app  version of its integrated business management platform earlier this year. 
 The business super app, which is free for download, enables small business owners to run operations entirely from their smartphones – a particular boon in emerging mobile-first markets like India and Indonesia. 
 In these  mobile-first markets , people bypass desktop computers and laptops in favor of more affordable mobile devices. 
 Case in point: In Indonesia,  nearly 55% of the population  were internet users in 2017. Only about 31% of the urban population owned desktop computers; most people accessed the internet through their smartphones. 
 And as mobile phones are  important  in empowering smaller entrepreneurs in these developing markets, having access to mobile business management tools will prove useful. 
 With Deskera’s app, sales staff can generate quotations and easily convert them into invoices that they can then send across a variety of messaging apps. 
 These invoices can then be connected to an inventory management platform – where teams can see what is in stock and what needs to be replenished – as well as an accounting system that makes tracking sales easier. 
 This is especially helpful during the pandemic, as staff working in warehouses can update inventory and shipping information in real-time, enabling the sales team to have easy access to information they need as they close deals remotely.

 “So far, there is no business application on mobile that is full-featured,” says Dixit. Applications are typically built for desktop, he adds, but running the Deskera app on smartphones gives a company some distinct advantages. 
 With a mobile phone camera, for example, workers can scan barcodes and record business card information. The app also uses AI to scan receipts for expense claims and inputs the information into the relevant fields. Managers can then review these claims and approve or reject them from the app. 
 The app also aggregates all data across sales, payroll, and other business functions into a dashboard, giving founders a comprehensive 360-degree look at their business. 
 By using Deskera’s platform, information that would otherwise be scattered across various paper documents or programs can be viewed at a glance and analyzed in more detail – something that’s particularly useful for startups now as they  evaluate their operations  in order to reduce burn rates and stay afloat. 
 The mobile app can also be seamlessly connected to Deskera’s desktop software, allowing teams to access information wherever and whenever they need to – something that is especially useful as working from home has become the norm. 
 Businesses may need to scale up to the desktop platform in order to access other services in Deskera’s suite, such as payroll management and bank reconciliation. Connectivity and interoperability between the two platforms goes a long way in ensuring a smoother digital transition. 
 This is also great for startups in the long-term: As the business expands, users can be added to the platform as required, enabling information to flow easily between the different parts of a company. 
 Seizing the opportunity for growth 
 While the months ahead still  look gloomy , Dixit believes that the pandemic has created an opportunity for companies to look inward and go back to the basics. 
 For startups, his additional advice is to look ahead and make preparations for what comes after the outbreak. Aside from streamlining operations and creating a “nerve center” to keep things moving even with everyone working remotely, businesses must  face challenges head-on  by pivoting to new directions, reworking their pricing models, and building stronger relationships with their customers. 
 “Use [this time] as a testing ground for saving costs and running your business more efficiently,” Dixit says. “This is the time to make your business more ready for the future. Those who [adapt] will survive, but for those who don’t, there will be challenges.” 
 
 Deskera is a cloud-based business software provider that enables businesses to run their operations more efficiently. Its new  mobile app , which has had 300,000 downloads to date, allows owners to manage their businesses from their smartphones. It is available on both iOS and Android.

648024,KKR to pour $1.5b in India’s Jio Platforms," Global investment firm KKR today announced that it will invest US$1.5 billion in  Jio Platforms , the digital services arm of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries for a 2.32% equity stake on a fully diluted basis. 
 The new investment gives Jio an equity value of US$64.9 billion and an enterprise value of US$68.2 billion, according to a statement.

 With KKR’s backing, Jio has now raised a total of US$10.4 billion in just over a month. 
 In April, social media giant Facebook injected  US$5.7 billion  in Jio, with the two firms reportedly planning to create a WeChat-like super app. About two weeks later, US-based investment firms Silver Lake and Vista Equity Partners announced investments in Jio of  US$747 million  and  US$1.5 billion , respectively. 
 And just this week, the digital services firm said it’s set to receive another  US$870 million  from General Atlantic. 
 Since its inception, KKR has invested over US$30 billion in total enterprise value in various tech companies, including Bytedance and Gojek. Its investment in Jio is backed by the firm’s Asia private equity and growth tech funds, according to the statement. India has been a key strategic market for KKR since 2006, the company said. 
 Moving forward, Jio aims to enable a digital society for 1.3 billion people and businesses across India, including small merchants, microbusinesses, and farmers. 
 It has created an ecosystem comprised of networks, devices, applications and content, platforms, service experiences, and affordable tariffs. It made voice calls for Jio customers free across India, helping it to gain over 388 million subscribers.

 Bobobox provides affordable hotel accommodation in the form of modular capsules. They are fitted with applications and internet-of-things systems to improve security, comfort, and affordability. 
 With the fresh funding, the three-year-old startup plans to accelerate its product improvement by growing its tech team and strengthening its manufacturing and operating models. 
 It also plans to extend its business to new markets in Southeast Asia once the world recovers from the pandemic. 
 Bobobox said that it has added six new locations in three cities since its funding round last year, bringing its total operating buildings to eight, with over 500 pods. It also has four new locations in three cities ready to launch, subject to Covid-19 circumstances. 
 “We are always on the move to secure more locations to serve the market better. However, in the meantime, we will focus on new features and protocols to address Covid-19 situations […],” said Bobobox co-founder and president Antonius Bong. 
 Bobobox said that it has kept its occupancy rate at around 50% and 60% even with the pandemic hitting the tourism industry hard. While it has fallen compared to its pre-pandemic rate of around 80% to 90%, the company said it has been doing relatively well compared to other accommodation players, with local users becoming its new regulars. 
 “Our lean operating model also allows us to maintain a low burn rate, so we have a longer, sturdier runway ahead, compared to traditional accommodation players,” said Indra Gunawan, co-founder and CEO of Bobobox. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(1, 0.9995521)]",[],['Bobobox']
647996,Paktor acquired by Singapore advisory firm Kollective Ventures," Singapore-based advisory firm Kollective Ventures said it has completed its acquisition of local dating and networking app operator  Paktor Group  from Taiwan’s M17 Entertainment. 
 The deal marks Kollective’s first foray into full buyouts, extending beyond minority equity investments, according to a statement. Financial details of the deal were undisclosed.

 “Paktor is a rock-solid asset with many high potential products under its wing. The dating industry in Asia has been growing rapidly in recent years,” said Kollective managing partner Kheng Lian Ho. The company is also set to announce a number of growth initiatives soon, the exec added. 
 According to the statement, the combined listed value of global dating companies now exceeds US$25 billion. Apps have also been evolving to add video and voice elements to their offerings. 
 “Global dating leaders have shown the immense size of these businesses but in Asia, the growth is only just starting,” said Paktor CEO Shn Juay. 
 After the sale, M17 plans to shift its focus on accelerating the growth of its core livestreaming business in Japan and new markets. It also looks to bolster its position in Chinese-speaking markets such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, the company said in a separate statement. 
 Paktor Group was formed in 2013 by M17’s current CEO Joseph Phua. It owns a number of dating assets, including its namesake app that has operations in Taiwan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. It also runs GoodNight, an app that enables voice conversations between strangers. 
 Paktor was merged with livestreaming company 17 Media in April 2017 to form M17 and broaden the scope of its business, focusing on social entertainment. 
  Tech in Asia  earlier reported that M17 had held advanced talks to sell Paktor to other dating app companies last year. However, no deals materialized amid disagreements in valuation, a source familiar with the matter said. 
  See:  Paktor cuts jobs as two key markets slump; sees bright spot in voice dating app   
 It was also reported that Paktor has conducted multiple layoffs since two years ago. According to former staff familiar with the numbers, the company’s headcount had fallen from about 250 to 190 between 2018 and 2019. 
 However, Juay said that the startup now has around 200 employees after making annual job cuts part of its regular operational reviews. The chief exec admitted that it has been “more aggressive this year in terms of the resizing,” with plans to cut 5% of its workforce by the end of Q1.

 Founded in 2015, Hoozing operates an online marketplace where users can find and rent long-term accommodations. With a community-based model, users can discover available spaces from current tenants who are about to move out. 
 The company said it aims to digitalize real estate transactions in Vietnam to make renting accessible, trustful, and hassle-free. However, it acknowledges that people tend to save their cash rather than spend it on property during a pandemic. 
 “However, the trend of digitalizing property transaction is on the rise, and Hoozing will use the fund to design the tech platforms to help the market with this demand,” the company told  Tech in Asia . 
 Hoozing is now launching an app, which uses the company’s data bank and agent network to help landlords and customers find the right deals. It will bring together more than 50,000 properties and 7,000 agents from the Hoozing ecosystem, according to a statement. 
 With the app, customers can search, do online visits, and get insights from agents and market data analysis. It will also have features such as smart search, 3D viewing of properties, and smart price comparison. 
 The startup said it also plans to expand in Ho Chi Minh City and focus on areas where there’s real customer demand. 
 Previously, Hoozing secured seed money from Southeast Asia-focused VC firm Expara Ventures. It also joined the TV show  Shark Tank Vietnam  in 2018. 
 Last year, another local proptech player, Rever, received funding in a  US$2.3 million  round backed by GEC-KIP Technology and Innovation Fund. The startup, which is also backed by VinaCapital Ventures, aims to expand across Vietnam as well, starting with key markets such as Hanoi.

647939,Ride-hailing startup Tada closes extended series A round," Singapore-based  MVLLabs  (MVL), which operates blockchain-based ride-hailing service  Tada , today announced that it has completed an undisclosed amount in a series A extension round led by South Korea’s Shinhan Bank. 
 Die-casting specialist Samkee Automotive and South Korean furniture brand Iloom also participated in the round, which brings the company’s total capital raised for its series A round to just under US$10 million, according to a statement. 
 The latest investment follows MVL’s  US$5 million  series A raise led by South Korean VC firm SV Investment last year.

 MVL is a mobility ecosystem based on the mass vehicle ledger incentive-based mobility blockchain protocol. With the technology, mobility data such as transactions, movements, accidents, and vehicle maintenance are recorded and connected in a single ecosystem. 
 In 2018, MVL launched Tada in Singapore. Since then, it claims that over 81,000 drivers and more than 550,000 users have used the ride-hailing service in Singapore, Vietnam, and Cambodia. 
 According to the statement, the new funding will support MVL’s continued expansion within its existing markets. It will also enable the company to scale Tada and deliver new products and services. 
 Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, MVL launched Tada Delivery in Cambodia to help businesses and its drivers with their income and livelihood. 
 “The company will always focus on building the mobility ecosystem. Meanwhile, it is studying the delivery market and identifying opportunities in the space, which will be one of the areas of focus moving forward,” the company told  Tech in Asia . 
 Tada’s fundraise comes as the ride-hailing industry struggles in the midst of the pandemic. Just this week, India’s Ola announced  job cuts that would affect 1,400 people  as its revenue dropped by 95% over the past two months. 
 US-based Uber also  laid off more than 6,000 employees  and shut down some of its offices, an effect of the company downsizing its business. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(3, 0.9995236)]","['Uber', 'Iloom', 'Ola', 'MVL', 'Tada']","['US', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'India', 'Cambodia', 'Vietnam', 'Tada']"
647923,The dark – and bright – side of cloud kitchens," We know this much about cloud kitchens: Also called dark or ghost kitchens, they are spaces designed to prepare food that’s meant for delivery. Simply put, they are centralized kitchens without a storefront, though some include a dine-in option. 
 For restaurateurs and budding entrepreneurs, cloud kitchens can be a low-risk, lower-cost  investment to test a new location or fresh culinary concepts, as it doesn’t require a huge upfront capital outlay for real estate or infrastructure, unlike opening a new restaurant.

 “It’s super efficient. Each operator gets a kitchen with basic equipment. There’s no front of the house, no dine-in area,” Arin Aghazarian, general manager of  Smart City Kitchens  (SCK) in Singapore, tells  Tech in Asia . The startup, which opened its doors in the city-state in June 2019, is an affiliate of Uber founder Travis Kalanick’s  CloudKitchens  in the US. 
 Each SCK facility comes with exhaust, aircon, and plumbing. The firm handles all non-core services such as cleaning and pest control as well as interactions with delivery personnel who pick up takeout orders. All restaurant owners have to do is “bring in their own equipment and they can start operating,” Aghazarian says. 
 But there’s a catch: Because restaurants concede marketing, payments and delivery support to kitchen operators, they risk losing control of the very customers they serve. We’ve seen parallels of this in ecommerce, where marketplaces like Amazon offer a glimpse of how brands can become commoditized amid a sea of millions of other products. 
 You become a factory serving a landlord, who can squeeze you on all fronts. 
 Southeast Asia’s food delivery market is expected to grow to  US$20 billion  in 2025, recording a 50x growth from 2015. Despite such significant growth, industry players continue to lose money. 
 For food delivery companies such as Foodpanda, Deliveroo, and Grab in Singapore, or Swiggy and Zomato in India, operating a cloud kitchen is just one of many potential revenue streams. They also need to create other verticals such as grocery delivery to become profitable in a high-burn, thin-margin industry. 
 How it works 
 In exchange for infrastructural, marketing, and delivery support, cloud kitchen operators share revenue with their food and beverage (F&amp;B) partners. Some charge restaurants a commission for each order while others charge a flat monthly fee with a variable component. Deliveroo says restaurants operating at its kitchens are not required to pay rent. 
 Cloud kitchen operators select F&amp;B partners based on their popularity and projected demand. “For example, if a certain area has a lack of sushi options, we will look at bringing onboard a Japanese restaurant that sells sushi,” a Foodpanda spokesperson says. 
 Since their earnings are dependent on total order volumes, food delivery platforms have an incentive to help restaurants succeed through various means.

 “Cloud kitchens allow us to have multiple brands on the platform,” says Song En Ho, co-founder of Singapore-based gourmet hamburger chain  Wolf Burgers . The restaurant has been operating a kitchen at Deliveroo Editions for about two years. It’s also on GrabKitchen, and recently signed a lease with Smart City Kitchens. Apart from Wolf Burger, Song plans to test out two to three virtual brands via these platforms. 
 Deliveroo says it collaborates with its restaurant partners to test and streamline menus. Blu Kouzina, a family-run Greek restaurant in Singapore, has launched two virtual brands via the platform. Both are showing good traction: Vios, a fast-casual Mediterranean bowl concept, has seen revenue climb over eight times since its launch in August 2017, while Lucky Souvlaki, which serves Greek street food, has posted “nearly 50%” growth in revenue after its debut in March 2018. 
 Cloud kitchens aren’t all operated by food delivery platforms, though. 
 Full-stack operators such as  Grain  and Kuala Lumpur-based  Dahmakan  are in charge of everything, from the technical aspects of ordering and cooking down to the logistics of delivery – a somewhat enclosed system.

 Grain currently has four facilities in Singapore, including a central kitchen and a number of mobile hubs that serve as distribution centers. “Like Apple, we wanted to control the end-to-end customer experience,” Grain co-founder Yi Sung Yong says. Such a model helps the company to pivot fast to meet demand and supply changes, since they deal directly with customers’ online orders and prepare the food. 
 Compared to renting an actual restaurant space, cloud kitchens “are easily 6x to 15x cheaper [in terms of] rent,” Yong adds. That’s because Grain’s cloud kitchens don’t need to be on streets with a lot of footfall – just being in the general vicinity of such areas can make a huge difference in terms of cost, he says. 
 SCK offers a solution similar to cloud kitchens operated by food delivery companies, except it’s agnostic when it comes to delivery service providers. This means that F&amp;B owners can choose to send out meals via order management solution Oddle, logistics service Lalamove, or food delivery platforms such as Grab, Foodpanda, or Deliveroo. This flexibility can be crucial. 
 Exclusivity concerns 
 A food delivery operator commonly prevents restaurants that run on their platform or kitchen from engaging a rival’s service. 
 The practice puts minor players at a disadvantage because they may struggle with the limited reach of a single delivery channel, even though a restaurant with significant market share might do just fine.

 Ichiban Bento, a casual Japanese restaurant which signed up as one of the tenants at PandaKitchen’s Singapore facilities in March 2018, chose not renew its lease when the contract expired. “While we save on labor cost, we are paying much higher [fees overall],” says Yan Ting Kek, an assistant manager at RE&amp;S, the company which runs the Ichiban Bento brand. 
 “We set up the cloud kitchen in the first place after considering the population density, new market segment in the industrial area, as well as the affordability of the fees structure. However, after completing the lease term, we realized we couldn’t turn a profit, and decided not to renew,” Kek adds. 
 A typical lease term can range from one to two years,  Tech in Asia  understands. Foodpanda didn’t comment on current occupancy rates but said it supports nine merchants across its two cloud kitchens in Singapore. 
 While neutral kitchens like SCK allow F&amp;B businesses more freedom to operate and more negotiating power with food delivery providers,  anti-competitive practices  can limit their efficacy. 
 SCK declined to comment on the status of a complaint it filed with Singapore’s Competition and Consumer Commission last July against Deliveroo and GrabFood. The operator, however, is now “working closely” with Grab. Some of its licensees are on the latter’s island-wide delivery program, Aghazarian says. 
 From landlord to competitor 
 As food delivery operators and the restaurant owners they support grow in scale, they amass millions of data points on their consumers, including meal preferences, dining habits, and spending capacity. But that also means restaurant owners are becoming increasingly powerless. 
 “If you’re a restaurant using their space, your marketing, delivery channel, and landlord are all one company. Now this one company has a lot of control over you. They have all your data, they own your customers – as a restaurant, you don’t know who your customers are anymore,” says an industry watcher with experience running cloud kitchens in the region. 
 “You become a factory serving a landlord, who can squeeze you on all fronts,” adds the source, who didn’t want to be named. 
 That data puts cloud kitchen operators in good stead to launch their own food brands – and many have done exactly that. 
 Indian food delivery platform Swiggy operates around 1,000 cloud kitchens across 14 cities in the country. In addition to that, it has developed four private labels: The Bowl Company, Goodness Kitchen, Breakfast Express, and Homely. These in-house brands have  drawn flak  from the restaurants that they directly compete with on Swiggy. 
 “They’re taking the data of the most popular restaurants on the platform, the price points, branding, and recipes, and figuring out what sells… and creating their own versions of it,” says the anonymous industry observer, referring to similar efforts by some cloud kitchens in Southeast Asia. 
 Grab says it does not operate any of its own brands, but helps merchants to do so. “Merchants have launched a number of virtual brands that operates out of GrabKitchen across the region. These can be tied to a current F&amp;B brand or created as a completely new brand,” a Grab spokesperson says. The company operates 50 cloud kitchens in Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand, among others.

 Amazon India also has plans to soon launch its private brand,  Amazon Restaurants , in Bengaluru through its cloud kitchens when its rolls out delivery services later this year. 
 What happens when the balance of power tilts fully in favor of the food delivery and cloud kitchen operators? 
 Potentially, it could result in further predatory practices. “You’re taking [an estimated] 30% from restaurants today and offering all these services. If you are able to operate these yourself and you know what people want to eat and what they’ll pay for it.. Why take 30%, why not 90%, and remove the restaurants altogether?” the source points out. 
 Taking the middle ground, Naspers-backed Swiggy is now looking to  co-create exclusive brands with restaurants  on the platform instead. Under the plan, food is prepared by restaurants, who will also own the brands. Swiggy plans to scale that initiative to 300 brands by the end of this year, up from the current 100. 
 SCK, however, is steering clear of that space. “We are not planning to operate any F&amp;B [business], but we do help our licensees if they want to launch a secondary virtual brand,” Aghazarian says. 
 Not all bad 
 While the costs of operating at a cloud kitchen are admittedly high, Ho of Wolf Burgers says costs aren’t the company’s primary concern “We’re more focused on access – to be able to provide the consumer access to Wolf Burgers, whether you’d like to come down to our store, order from home, or when you’re stuck at the office.” Getting food to customers as fresh as possible is another draw, he adds.

 The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transition of both restaurants and consumers, as people seek online ordering options. SCK says order volumes and occupancy rates are the “highest [it] has ever seen.” 
 It’s unclear if that’s enough to drive the launch of more cloud kitchens in the future, even though some, like Grab’s food delivery business, has  seen an uptick . None of the cloud kitchens in Singapore that  Tech in Asia  spoke to shared definitive plans. 
 Before the pandemic, delivery orders in India across operators were averaging 100 million a month. That’s decreased dramatically to 20 million, as consumers become more cautious about making any form of contact with outsiders, including delivery people, says Satish Meena, an analyst at market research firm Forrester. A recent case of a  delivery driver testing positive for Covid-19  hasn’t helped. 
 In China, leading food delivery player Meituan-Dianping is expecting negative year-on-year revenue growth and operating losses for the first quarter of 2020 because of customers’ safety concerns as well as supply disruptions as some restaurants remain closed. Food delivery revenue is expected to fall 13% in the same quarter, though a “swift recovery” after Covid-19 is expected, according to a March report by Bernstein Research. 
 Amid dwindling sales, Swiggy said it will  lay off over 1,000 employees  across its cloud kitchen division. Its rival Zomato also announced that it would be slashing  about 13%  of its workforce due to large-scale restaurant closures amid the pandemic. 
 But there are bright spots in this gloomy environment. F&amp;B operators in Singapore now need far less convincing to join digital platforms compared to six to nine months ago. At the heart of it, cloud kitchens still serve as an avenue through which restaurants can experiment with new brands, menus, and concepts. 
 “Cloud kitchens are part of the digitization of F&amp;B. [We want to] provide a quality dining experience at an affordable price. Cloud kitchens allow us to fulfill that mission,” Wolf Burger’s Ho says.

647847,How have you pivoted in this pandemic?," Dear readers, 
 By now, I hope you have accepted Covid-19 and  the stress  that it brings along as the new normal. 
 It’s counterproductive to think otherwise and dwell on old times, user behavior, and habits. The world has changed (and so should we), and it will keep changing even after this pandemic ends. 
 Even as leaders preach the need to pivot and adapt, it’s hard to rewire ingrained practices and processes. We are creatures of habit, and habit helps us to go through life effortlessly. Without it, our day-to-day routine will be peppered with mental friction and frustration. 
 We face the same at  Tech in Asia . Prior to the lockdown, our physical offices in Singapore and Jakarta were filled with positive vibes and peals of laughter. But now that we’re all working in isolation, it’s harder to feel that camaraderie. 
 It doesn’t deter us, though, from doing what we can to keep it alive. 
 We do daily random quizzes (e.g. What’s your guilty pleasure? 😉 The answers were… interesting) and occasionally host virtual drinks or karaoke sessions. To ensure we don’t forget our colleagues’ faces, we encourage everyone to turn on the video function during online team meetings. 
 On the business side of things, we’ve been discussing and debating about what to change and prioritize for the new world. Of course, we  looked around for references  and traded notes with fellow product makers and asked  our users . 
 On making changes 
 This has resulted in a few changes, including: 
 
 Virtual events – We’ve organized at least five virtual live sessions in the last 30 days, which got very healthy engagements. You’ll see more exciting developments on this front. 
 TIA Lite – We launched a more  affordable  subscription that costs just $4.92 a month or $0.17 a day – perfect for today’s economy. 
 User preference-related features – We’re looking to build a reader and an editorial dashboard, made possible thanks to the support of  Google News Initiative . 
 Visual stories – We’ve been telling stories through  visual and interactive  charts and graphs. This one is popular: “ Why Indonesia’s economy will experience a boom in this decade ” 🇮🇩 
 TIA original videos – We’re experimenting with original video stories and this is our first one: Crossing Borders – Tapping into Greater Southeast Asia. 
 
    
 Virtual product conference 
 Another pivot is our  virtual Product Development Conference , which will be fully online and will happen on July 1 to 2 (Indonesia) and July 8 to 9 (regional). We picked the theme “Pivoting products in a pandemic” so we could extend the discussion to include even more product makers and business owners. Here are some of the interesting talks we’ve lined up for you: 
 
 Executing Product in the Middle of Uncertainty by Alfonsius P. Timboel 
Alfonsius is Halodoc’s chief product officer, and he’ll be sharing how the health tech startup reacted when Covid-19 hit. 
 Building a Hardware Startup 101 by Eric Migicovsky 
A partner at Y Combinator and founder of defunct smartwatch startup Pebble, Eric will discuss how startups can manage their supply chain and distribution in the post-Covid world. 
 How Covid-19 Has Accelerated the Fintech Industry by Amar Abrol 
Amar, who serves as chief commercial officer at MatchMove, will talk about how Covid-19 has changed user needs and how to develop a product that anticipates these changes. 
 
 We have  many more interesting sessions in store for u . Please  join us  if you find the sessions useful. 
 On doing better 
 We always strive to improve and do better. Unfortunately, we may not always meet the standards we aspire to reach. And when we make mistakes, it is only right to  apologize . 
 I had a healthy one-on-one chat with Oyo boss Ritesh Agarwal, and I’m thankful for his graciousness and kind words. Allow me to share some of that with you via this quote: 
  
  “That’s very responsible for your team to put up. I have always respected  Tech in Asia , but [that] increases my respect further.”
  
 I have to admit that the mistake still stings, but what’s done is done. We can only look forward and be a better version of ourselves. 🙏 
 Cheers, 
Willis

 Seekmi says disinfection businesses are currently in high demand as companies begin to reopen. The offering, called Advanced Disinfection Service, aims to ensure that homes are safe from the novel coronavirus. 
 Users may avail of the service – with a starting price of 310,000 rupiah (US$21) – through Seekmi’s official online store. It’s available for order in all of Jakarta’s metropolitan areas. 
 The move opens up several cashless options for Seekmi users moving forward, according to a statement. Customers can track their order progress right on Tokopedia and Lazada as if they were purchasing any other product. 
 The collaboration marks Tokopedia and Lazada’s first foray into offering home and office services on their platforms and gives Seekmi an edge over competitors in the country such as Klik N Clean, Sejasa, and Tukang Bersih. 
 Founded in 2015, Seekmi has over 20,000 skilled and certified technicians, cleaners, and drivers on its platform. Aside from disinfection, platform also offers plumbing, home appliance maintenance, cleaning, and laundry assistance. 
 GoodWork, which provides similar services in the Philippines, also recently added special disinfection cleaning to its offerings. The startup may stand as a competitor to Seekmi in the region, as it plans to extend its reach across Southeast Asia after securing  US$1.6 million  in seed funding last week.

647897,Nasdaq sends delisting notice to Luckin Coffee following fraud case," 
 Nasdaq has notified Luckin Coffee on May 15 that it  plans to delist its American depositary shares  from the market, according to a press release from Luckin on Tuesday.

 The stock market’s listing qualification staff based their decision on public interest concerns raised by the fabricated transaction scandal and the company’s past failure to publicly disclose critical information, said Luckin, citing a  regulatory filing  with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
 The move comes after Luckin admitted last month that US$310 million of its sales were fabricated, as it announced an investigation into the conduct of former chief operating officer Jian Liu,  KrAsia  reported. The admission quickly sent Luckin’s stocks down 75.57% to US$6.4 per share. 
 The company experienced a management shakeup in recent weeks, following the  termination  of former CEO Jenny Qian and COO Jian Liu and the appointment of Jinyi Guo – previously director and senior vice president of Luckin – as the new acting CEO of the firm. 
   Luckin added on its press release that it plans to request a timely hearing to remain listed on Nasdaq, which could be scheduled 30 to 45 days after the request. 
 Nasdaq also announced yesterday that  trading in Luckin Coffee is scheduled to resume today , more than one month after the halt on April 7. Luckin’s market capitalization stood at US$1.1 billion after closing at US$4.39 on April 6. 
 “The decision is out of my expectations,” said Luckin’s chairman Zhengyao Lu, adding that results of the investigations have yet to come out, according to  36Kr.  In addition to the company’s internal probes, Luckin is under investigation by the SEC and the China Securities Regulatory Commission separately. 
 Lu added that he is disappointed and regretful at Nasdaq’s decision, but apologized for the damage done by the scandal. 
 Luckin’s financial mess has also been affecting Ucar, a company founded by Lu, who is also the biggest shareholder. The car-hailing firm is seeking to sell its 1 billion yuan (US$141 million) limited partner interest in private equity firm Centurium Capital’s yuan fund to avoid a cash crunch, as financial institutions and suppliers are demanding payments following the Luckin scandal,  Reuters  reported on Wednesday, citing people close to the matter.

 “We had all hoped in the beginning that this would be a short-lived crisis and that its impact would be temporary,” Ola co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal wrote in an  email  to employees. “But unfortunately, it’s not been a short crisis. And the prognosis ahead for our business is very unclear and uncertain.” 
 According to the letter, the layoffs will affect employees in Ola’s mobility, food, and financial services units. The company assured its staff, however, that the move is a one-time exercise and that no more pandemic-related cuts would be done afterward. 
 Affected employees will be given at least three months of their fixed salary, vesting of employee stock ownership plans, medical, life, and accident insurance, as well as career and health and wellness support. 
 All members of its leadership team have also taken salary cuts to help the company weather the crisis, Aggarwal said. 
 “This crisis necessitates the need to conserve cash aggressively so that we are able to invest in opportunities in the future,” he wrote. 
 The chief exec noted that the crisis is accelerating macro trends in digital commerce and clean mobility. During this period, Ola will leverage technology to improve efficiencies and reduce cost. It will also hire talent in research and development across the group to double down on innovation and engineering. 
 The virus has hit ride-hailing companies hard, with movement restriction orders keeping people at home. Regional player Grab recently offered flexible working arrangements such as no-pay leaves, reduced working hours, and sabbaticals to its employees as its total revenue falls  lower than pre-pandemic numbers .

 In an interview with  Bloomberg , PropertyGuru CEO Hari Krishnan attributed the result to a surge in regional wealth. However, he expects the growth to start slowing down amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

 “We need to see how bad it gets in May and June before we really know how the whole year is going to play out,” Krishnan shared, adding that it would be difficult for the company to deliver results similar to what it’s been recording since 2017. 
 Last year, PropertyGuru grew its revenue to S$88.4 million (US$62.4 million), which exceeds the S$85.6 million (US$60.4 million) it forecasted in its now withdrawn IPO prospectus. In the prospectus, the company also said that it made US$28.6 million in the first half of 2019, up from US$18.6 million in the same period the year before. 
 Back in October 2019, PropertyGuru had announced its plans to go public in Australia, initially targeting to raise  US$257 million . It later  shelved  its IPO plans amid market uncertainty at the time. 
 During his interview with  Bloomberg , Krishnan said that it’s unclear when PropertyGuru will take another crack at listing its shares, especially given the economic uncertainty brought by Covid-19. 
 Launched in 2007, PropertyGuru is a property major in Southeast Asia, claiming to have over 75% market share in Singapore. It also has operations in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

647810,Didi starts hiring van drivers for new cargo service," Chinese ride-hailing giant  Didi Chuxing  is hiring van drivers in two principal capitals in China – Chengdu and Hangzhou – for its freight delivery pilot project, according to a  post  on its official WeChat account.

 The company is looking to hire up to 600 drivers from May 18 to June 18. Those who want to sign up will have to deposit 800 yuan (US$112) and pay 50 yuan (US$7) for an on-van marketing fee. Commission fees will be exempted for the first 30 days. 
 Didi said it does not have any additional information to share on this topic in response to  Tech in Asia ‘s inquiry. 
 The recruitment comes as the company ventures into logistics in a bid to broaden its mobility services. The market, which could reach over  10 trillion yuan (US$1.4 trillion) , is already occupied by established players such as SoftBank-backed Manbang Group, Lalamove, and JD.com-backed Fuyou Kache, among others. 
 Earlier this year, Didi launched a home delivery service called Paotui, which means running errands in Chinese. It offers general door-to-door services on demand, charging 12 yuan (roughly less than US$2) to 20 yuan (US$3) for the first 10 kilometers. 
 The company also previously introduced public bus services as it aims for an 8% penetration rate in the broader mobility market. 
 Didi’s ride-hailing business was hard-hit after the Covid-19 pandemic had prompted travel restrictions. However, Didi president Jean Liu recently said that the core segment is  becoming profitable  again, with ride volumes going back to about 60% to 70% of its numbers before the pandemic.

647785,"India’s social commerce startups are dodging Amazon, Flipkart"," 
 Lockdown or not, Navjot Kaur gets up every day and greets her online audience from her living room. The 30-year-old fitness trainer works as an influencer on Indian livestream commerce platform  BulBul , helping sell health products to hundreds of viewers in smaller Indian towns. 
 Kaur is part of a growing digital army helping India’s social commerce apps sidestep competition from major players such as US-based Amazon and Walmart-backed Flipkart. Both ecommerce giants offer steep discounts to gain scale and market share, burning cash from their deep pockets. But for India’s social commerce startups, this is not an option. 
 Most of India’s social influencers come from the country’s smaller towns and villages. 
 For example, Kaur hails from Ghaziabad, a Tier 2 city some 35 kilometers away from New Delhi, the capital city. She does two to three 30-minute live sessions and another two pre-recorded videos per day according to her contract with BulBul, which is named after a local songbird. She’s paid about US$13.25 per video, and her  latest sale  was for hand sanitizers. 
 
  Photo credit: BulBul 
 
 In the video, Kaur was helping sell Vettol, a hand sanitizer brand. The resemblance to UK-based Reckitt Benckiser’s Dettol is not a coincidence. A 500-milliliter bottle of Vettol costs US$3.32, around 60% less than an equivalent bottle of Dettol, BulBul co-founder Sachin Bhatia tells  Tech in Asia . 
 This helps achieve net margins of around 10% after accounting for cost of goods sold and delivery charges, he says. BulBul sources its products directly from smaller and newer brands to keep unit costs profitable, says Bhatia. 
 The China Model 
 Bhatia’s startup is modeled on one of three major business models prevalent in China’s social commerce industry. These are content sharing, membership, and team purchasing, according to a  report  from Fung Business Intelligence. 
 To sell merchandise, for instance, rival and market leader  Meesho  depends on its members while BulBul relies on content creators. User-generated content is also seen as an effective way to increase engagement and customer reach. 
 The number of mobile phone and internet users surged after Jio, a unit of local conglomerate Reliance, introduced cheap mobile internet plans, says Anshul Sushil, CEO of communication technology firm Wizikey. Expectations are for India to mimic China’s explosive growth in social commerce, he says. In fact, investments into Indian social commerce startups more than doubled in 2019 from a year earlier, according to research firm Venture Intelligence. 
 Meesho leads the pack, having raised the most capital in a series D funding round in August 2019. South Africa’s Naspers led the round, with Facebook and existing investors SAIF Partners, Sequoia, Shunwei Capital, RPS and Venture Highway participating. 
    
 Naspers invested in Meesho through its international investment arm Prosus Ventures because it fits into the group’s strategy of backing firms catering to a “big societal need” in a high-growth market, Ashutosh Sharma, Prosus’ head of India, tells  Tech in Asia  in an email reply. As the world copes with the continued spread of Covid-19, Sharma hopes that social distancing will add a fillip to social commerce, pointing to new categories such as groceries that Meesho is expanding into. 
 Overcoming challenges 
 Despite gaining traction, Meesho’s social commerce business is struggling just like other startups hit by the pandemic. The startup charges a commission from suppliers, acting as a middle man between manufacturers and the end customer. It has  reportedly  fired 150 staff across India, citing “cost-cutting” measures. Meesho didn’t respond to *Tech in Asia’s* request for comments. 
 

 A lack of scale hurts the ability of Indian social commerce ventures to achieve unit economics, says experts. 
 India doesn’t have the same infrastructure as China, says Satish Meena, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. It’s expensive to deliver small-ticket items, making current social commerce models a loss-making proposition. 
 Without a super app like Tencent’s WeChat, group buying in villages is yet to pick up, says Meena. A platform that can aggregate customers and sell non-branded goods at scale like China’s Pinduoduo is also missing, he adds. 
  See:  These startups could unlock ecommerce’s true potential in Indonesia   
 India’s Covid-19 measures have also weighed on BulBul. 
 Monthly sales are down to about US$86,000 from pre-pandemic levels of US$700,000, while net deliveries have dropped to 13,000 from 105,000, says BulBul CEO Bhatia. There were zero sales after March 25, the day India imposed a complete lockdown. Sales only restarted on April, 20 when the government allowed for deliveries of essential goods to resume. 
 By pooling items into a single order, BulBul has been able to hold onto its average order value of US$6.63. This helps to raise the price point of a single order, observes Bhatia. Nearly 60% of orders are drop shipped from manufacturers. The rest are delivered from a single warehouse in the northern Indian city of Gurgaon. BulBul pays an average of US$1.33 per order. This has helped maintain margins at pre-lockdown levels, thanks to an early focus on unit economics., Bhatia says. 
 One of the firm’s early hires was someone who constantly looked at optimizing costs and processes, the co-founder says. This decision was based on  advice  from Shailendra Singh, managing director at Sequoia Capital India. 
 Economies of scale are needed in branded goods, Bhatia explains. Large buyers such as Amazon and Flipkart leverage their scale to seek discounts from manufacturers, but both companies are also launching in-house private labels to address demand from consumers seeking bargains. 
 BulBul wants to reduce the cost of logistics to 15% of the average order value from the current 20%, says Bhatia. 
 Loyalty pays 
 BulBul hopes that a content-focused model will help it avoid the deep-discounting game. 
 Most social commerce apps offer influencers a commission-based compensation, pushing them to adopt an aggressive sales pitch in their video blogs. 
 Giving influencers a sales target would “dilute the message” and affect loyalty among followers, says BulBul streamer Kaur. “People are the first to point out that you are doing this for sales.” She first found fame after local newspapers and television channels featured her weight-loss story.

 A loyal user base – for Kaur, that’s mostly homemakers and working women from India’s smaller towns – is helping with sales of health-related products, which in turn is cushioning some of the pandemic’s impact, according to Bhatia. 
 Short-term challenges notwithstanding, the sector is seen as a fertile ground for growth. India’s social commerce apps added more than 10 million sellers from 2018 to 2019,  estimates  Indian research firm Benori. 
 Social commerce startups could also boost the number of Indian ecommerce users to more than 250 million in 2022, says Mrigank Gutgutia, a Bangalore-based director at internet consulting firm Redseer. Some 74% of the 135 million users in 2019 used the internet for services but not ecommerce because of an unhelpful user interface, a lack of trust in the process, or language barrierss, he adds. 
 Many of those issues can be addressed by trusted influencers who end users identify with, says BulBul’s Bhatia. “We are all the new wave of ecommerce,” he concludes.

647784,India’s Khatabook raises $60m in round led by B Capital,"  Kirana  stores, or small family-owned shops, are the backbone of India’s domestic grocery retail landscape, with  a 90% market share . Under the ongoing nationwide lockdown, around 12 million  kiranas  need digital tools as more people rely on them for daily essentials. 
 Homegrown startup  Khatabook , which provides a digital ledger for small businesses, has raised US$60 million in series B funding to support the digitization of  kiranas  in the Covid-19 economy. 
 Its latest round was led by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin’s B Capital Group.

 Existing and new investors such as Sequoia India, partners at DST Global, Tencent, GGV Capital, RTP Global, Hummingbird Ventures, Falcon Edge Capital, Rocketship, and Unilever Ventures also participated in the round, according to a statement. Facebook’s Kevin Weil, Calm’s Alexander Will, and Cred’s Kunal Shah, as well as Snapdeal’s Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal also invested. 
 The new funding will support the company in developing tech-enabled financial services and a merchant-focused distribution platform. 
 Founded in 2018, Khatabook helps MSMEs efficiently track their businesses and manage credit to create transparency in cash flows and increase trust with consumers. 
 It also features online payment collection through a unified payments interface and QR code as well as sending periodic reminders to creditors via messages and reports. 
 The company claims it has reached over 8 million active merchants across 11 languages in less than a year. It saw more than 1 million merchants uploading data and engaging with the app daily while adding US$200 million worth of transactions every day. 
 India’s MSME market is worth around US$50 million to US60 million. But only less than 50% of the sector is currently taking advantage of technology, which is critical for businesses today to survive and thrive, said Sequoia’s Amit Jain. 
 Last year, Khatabook, which was part of  the first batch of startups  in Sequoia India’s accelerator Surge, raised US$1.5 million in a seed round. Then it secured  US$25 million  in series A money from a slew of financiers, including Tencent, Y Combinator, and more than 20 angel investors.

 “Letting go of our employees […] is one of the most difficult decisions that we had to take,” said Anuj Srivastava, co-founder and CEO at Livspace. 
 Affected employees and their families will receive extended medical coverage for several months. Laid-off staff will also receive one month’s salary, one to four weeks of extra pay, and outplacement services. 
 The company, meanwhile, assured that no downsizing measures are planned for its Singapore office, where its business has grown and is “looking strong.” It launched in the city-state last year. 
 Founded in 2014, Livspace offers end-to-end home design services, connecting interior designers, vendors, and customers in one platform. 
 Looking forward, the company said it’s concentrating its resources on further developing its tech platform and category and supply chain, as well as expanding across key international markets. It just started operations in Bangalore and Gurgaon and is set to deliver to “hundreds of homes in the coming weeks,” according to the statement. 
 In an interview with  Inc42 , Srivastava said that Livspace is  projecting profitability , given the funding it has in the bank. 
 It was reported earlier this year that the company raised roughly  US$60 million  from Tahoe Investment Group, Mercer Investments, and EDBI, among others. Its earlier investors include  Ikea  as well as Goldman Sachs and TPG Growth, which co-led its  US$70 million  series C round in 2018.

647746,500 Startups backs Vietnamese bookkeeping automation startup Bizzi," As more businesses ramp up their digital transformation initiatives in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, companies offering automation services are seeing an opportunity. 
 Vietnam-based  Bizzi  is one such example. The startup developed an accounting automation tool using  robotic process automation  (RPA) as it aims to simplify and digitize the financial operations of companies. 
 Today, the firm announced that it’s raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding from 500 Startups and other angel investors.

 Bizzi works on top of an existing accounting software to automate financial processes like bills payments, receipt scanning, compliance, and bookkeeping, among others. 
 It uses machine learning to better understand data context and increase the platform’s accuracy. According to the startup, its solution can save the time and money that businesses spend on daily financial processes by 80%. 
 “This new funding will allow us to accelerate growth toward our vision that every accountant should spend their time advising and crunching the numbers instead of doing manual work,” said Nghia Vu, the co-founder and CEO of Bizzi. 
 Vietnam’s digital economy is expected to reach  US$30 billion  by 2025, up from US$9 billion in 2018, according to a report. If it succeeds in digital transformation, its GDP could reach  US$162 billion  within 20 years. 
 The company said it currently serves small businesses, large-scale enterprises, and accounting firms, with clients such as market expansion services provider DKSH, nutritional products distributor 3A Nutritions, and South Korean convenience store chain GS25, among others. 
 Prior to its investment in Bizzi, 500 Startups also backed other early-stage companies in the region that are leveraging RPA. Its portfolio includes Hong Kong-based  Talkpush , which seeks to automate recruitment processes, and Singapore-based  Glee Trees  that adds AI to its automation product.

647395,Mukesh Ambani’s Kingdom,"   
 ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
 Mukesh Ambani is a business tycoon in India. He’s the chairman, managing director, and the largest shareholder  (with a 48% stake)  of Reliance Industries, an Indian-headquartered oil and gas giant. With a net worth of  US$53.1 billion , Ambani has been named the richest man in India for 12 years in a row and has recently taken the crown for Asia’s richest man. 
 
  
 
     
 
  
 
     
 Reliance Industries is now a Fortune 500 company worth  US$100 billion  and is one of the most valuable companies in India. 
 
 
 
 Undeniably, Jio Platforms, the telecom and digital arm of Reliance Industries, is the company’s fastest-growing business unit. With over  388 million subscribers , it’s taking India by storm. 
 Launched in 2016, Jio Platforms provides free voice calls and 4G networks with data tariffs below US$1 per gigabyte,  the lowest data tariff in the world . This was a game changer that brought India into a data revolution – enabling connections in untapped rural markets – and became a catalyst for emerging businesses. 
 The increased access is bringing millions of Indians online, carrying an economic opportunity that is expected to be worth  US$50 billion . 
 In the past four weeks, Jio has attracted four key investments, raising a total of  US$8.9 billion . Following Facebook’s multibillion-dollar investment in April, the company began testing a  grocery shopping feature  on Facebook’s WhatsApp. It was reported that the two firms have plans to build a WeChat-like super app for India that will empower nearly 30 million Indian  kirana  stores (mom and pop shops). 
 
  
 
     
 From 2018 to 2019, Reliance Industries Limited made nearly  49 mergers and acquisitions , strategic investments, and joint venture deals globally. 
 Apart from the list above, Reliance has also made significant investments in global tech startups such as Den, Hathway, Eros International, Edcast, KareXpert Technologies, Vakt Holdings Limited, Indiavidual Learning Pvt. Ltd., Radisys Corp., Videonetics, Kai OS Technologies, and SkyTran Inc. It also bought out iconic British toy maker Hamleys in a deal worth over  67.9 million pounds  or around US$83.1 million. 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
 Understanding Mukesh Ambani is not only about knowing who the richest man in Asia is, but it also involves learning about his background and home country. 
 India presents a huge opportunity – having a GDP worth  US$3.2 trillion  and a population of 1.4 billion people, it’s the fifth-largest economy in the world. Ambani was able to realize this opportunity. For more than 30 years, he successfully led a diversified portfolio which spanned across sectors like oil and gas, retail, telecommunications, and textiles to make his firm India’s largest private sector enterprise. 
 Amid the chaos of the Covid-19 pandemic and the oil price collapse, Ambani has turned toward the tech and digital industry to nurture his next wins.

647511,The emotional toll of executing layoffs," As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the economy, news of companies doing layoffs keep on coming. 
 Even big-name tech companies have been forced to make cuts: Airbnb, Uber, Tripadvisor, Bird… the list  goes on . Closer to home, Careem, Oyo, Zilingo, Klook, Traveloka, and Oriente have also been affected. 
 
  Photo credit:  Markus  Spiske 
 
 Layoffs in each firm have been handled differently. 
 While  Zilingo has been criticized  for their execution, they handled the situation far better than  Bird did . Tripadvisor’s and Airbnb’s businesses have been all but decimated, but they are still sitting on comfortable cash cushions, which means they can do things in a much better (and definitely more humane) way. 
 Beyond judging which companies did it right and which ones did it wrong based on the headlines, I would like to share some personal experiences, having executed a few layoffs myself. 
 DIY layoffs 
 The first one happened about five years ago when I was managing an operations team at a Rocket Internet company in Singapore. For whatever reason, we were having a tough time and had no choice but to lay off about 40% of the staff. 
 Truth be told, none of us had the experience of properly conducting a layoff and we were not in a position to hire expensive consultants. Like everything in a series A+ startup, we did it DIY style. 
 So we sat down with our target post-layoff payroll cost and a list of names. I have to admit that no matter how strong I pretended to be in front of bosses and investors, deciding which employees to let go wasn’t easy. I knew every single person working at the company and how committed they had been while working with me through many challenges. We had gone out for lunch and gotten drunk together at company gatherings plenty of times. 
 I suppose this is why bigger companies choose to hire consultants to handle layoffs: These professionals have no emotional attachments to the staff and can theoretically conduct the process better. But they are also human beings. 
 We spent a few hours working on the list, but it felt like ages. We were all exhausted by the end of it, but the more daunting task still lay ahead: communicating to the people who would be directly affected, and talking to those who would be staying. 
 Going through the process of conducting a town hall and holding individual meetings took an entire day, even though only 25 people were let go. Some cried, some were angry; I had to pretend I was calm no matter whom I was talking to. I am sure other colleagues who were doing the same with their respective teams felt the way I did. 
 Does it get easier each time? 
 Unfortunately, the nature of startups guaranteed that this experience would not be my last. I had to do it three more times since. 
 Some of them happened in satellite offices outside Singapore, where I had to fly in to spend a few days and work with local management as they go through the process. 
 I can tell you that emotionally, it does  not  get easier the more you do it. It gets better only in terms of knowing how to execute layoffs more efficiently, handling potential issues, and not getting too drunk afterwards. 
 During a town hall meeting held amid a series of layoffs in September last year, I saw people sighing in frustration, and some even burst into tears. 
 I turned to look at the director standing next to me and I saw him trying to hold back his emotions; he couldn’t bring himself to announce the outcome to everyone. 
 I was one of the people who conducted one-on-one sessions with colleagues to discuss either pay cuts or severance pay. There were times when I was on the verge of breaking down myself. I was struggling so hard to handle my own emotions because I knew I had to be professional to earn people’s trust and convince them that the company would help them through that difficult period. 
 The hardest part was that I couldn’t guarantee that things would be better after the layoffs. 
 Colleagues, alumni, friends 
 I’ve remained friends with some of the people I had to let go five years ago. We even gather for a meal every six months or so. 
 I suppose that is the best outcome for everyone: knowing that the experience we had together was cherished, and that everyone is in a better place now. 
 In my last layoff, there was one final meal with the departing members, and we spent the rest of the afternoon in the office. Someone played a guitar and people started singing – both those who were staying and those who would be leaving. 
 I just want to tell all of you that being upset with a layoff is normal, but don’t close yourself off. Layoffs are traumatic, but once it settles, you will see that there are positive notes to take away from these experiences.

644511,Foursquare’s angel pitch deck,"

 ABOUT 
 
 Year: 2009 
 Raised: Over US$1.3 million 
 Investors: O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, SV Angel, Joshua Schachter, Union Square Ventures, Kevin Rose, Jack Dorsey, Alex Rainert, Chad Stoller, Sergio Salvatore 
 
 Previously, Foursquare was a search and discovery app where users could regularly check in and share their locations to friends. While the social networking features have since been transferred to the company’s companion app, Swarm, Foursquare itself has pivoted and become an enterprise locational data company. It now works with over 150,000 partners globally, including Uber, Apple, Spotify, and Tencent. 
 It’s interesting to see how the firm has evolved over the past decade. Above, the 2009 angel pitch deck, which helped Foursquare raise over US$1.3 million, feels like a callback to the days when social gamification was prevalent – company logos, friend-finding functionalities, point mechanics, and all. 
  How is the deck compelling?  
 
 There’s a clear definition of the company’s functions – friend finder, social city guide, and social game – which is supported by visuals of the app. 
 It presents examples of the merchants who were the app’s early adopters. 
 The deck extensively illustrates the app’s gamification mechanics and ties it with Foursquare’s advertising-based revenue model.

 Grow is a global accelerator backed by Enterprise Singapore, venture investor AgFunder, and food and beverage brand Dole. Its new 12-week program Singapore Food Bowl aims to build more resilient and decentralized agrifood ecosystems in the wake of Covid-19, according to a statement. 
 With the initiative, Grow and its partners hope to build innovative solutions to industry challenges, such as yield predictions for farmers, food waste reduction in the supply chain, and the production of packaging alternatives. 
 The new program is also tied to Singapore’s “30 by 30” initiative, which hopes to reduce Singapore’s reliance on imports and source 30% of its nutritional needs domestically by 2030, up from the current 10%. It was launched in March of last year to enhance traditional production methods and make up for the city-state’s lack of available land.

647653,"The enigmatic tycoon guiding Oppo, Vivo, and Pinduoduo"," In the early 2000s, BBK Electronics Corporation was at the brink of falling apart as its mainstay audiovisual business dwindled. Under the leadership of founder Duan Yongping, the Chinese consumer electronics firm pivoted to smartphones. 
 This led BBK through a long, dramatic restructuring that resulted in the creation of Oppo and Vivo, which would become two of the world’s best-selling smartphone brands a decade later.

 While the two phonemakers now operate autonomously, their histories are closely intertwined with BBK and Duan is still widely regarded as the man behind their rise. 
 While Duan retired young 20 years ago at the age of 40, his influence and counsel has helped not just Oppo and Vivo but also other well-known Chinese tech companies such as ecommerce player Pinduoduo and internet firm NetEase. 
 An enigmatic group 
 Despite consistently being named as one of the  largest smartphone manufacturers in the world , BBK likes to stay out of the spotlight. 
 Often referred to by the media as “China’s Warren Buffett,” Duan is even more mysterious than the electronics empire he has built. 
 Duan came from humble beginnings. He was born to a farming family in the 1960s in the Jiangxi province in southeast China. In 1978, Duan enrolled in Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, where he majored in wireless electronics engineering. He was among the first group of students in the country to graduate from the university after the Cultural Revolution. 
 After receiving a master’s degree from Renmin University of China in Beijing, Duan went to work for a company called Zhongshan Yihua as the manager of a loss-making factory. The firm was known for making a knockoff version of Family Computer or Famicom, Nintendo’s bestselling gaming console, in the ‘80s.

 At a fourth of the original’s price, Yihua’s product was a runaway success, but Duan knew that it wasn’t enough to get the company very far. So he rebranded it as an educational device that allows children and students to learn English. It also had a new name: Subor or  Xiao Bawang , which translates to “little tyrant” in English. 
 The change worked. Duan made Subor appealing to both kids and parents, and it’s still an iconic brand for Chinese born in the ‘80s and ‘90s. 
 By 1995, the product’s sales hit 1 billion yuan (US$141 million) in a year. Before Duan joined Yihua, the factory was losing 2 million yuan per year. A key reason for his success was the emphasis on marketing. In the ‘90s, he gained a reputation for winning bids to air commercials on state-owned television channel CCTV during primetime, the most valuable and coveted ad slots at the time. 
 Duan was also the king of celebrity endorsements. Back then, dropping millions of dollars on an ad campaign wasn’t commonplace for Chinese firms, but he went ahead and signed up showbiz legend Jackie Chan to promote Subor. Years later, he would recruit Hong Kong and Hollywood stars Jet Li, Stephen Chow, and Arnold Schwarzenegger to tout BBK’s products. 
 While his career at Yihua was in full swing, Duan resigned after a public falling out with the company over his plan to spin off Subor and get a stake in the new venture was repeatedly rejected. 
 In 1998, Duan established BBK in Dongguan, an industrial city in China’s Guangdong province. Six Yihua employees followed him, including Shen Wei and Tony Chen Mingyong, who went on to set up Vivo and Oppo, respectively. 
 At first, Duan had a 70% controlling interest in BBK, but he later adopted an employee share ownership structure. It was a progressive move in China at the time ,as it allowed staff and even distributors to get a piece of the company. The move diluted his stake to around 17%. 
 The idea of giving the workforce part ownership in his company was a seed that grew in Duan early on. At Yihua, he pushed to reform the shareholding structure because, according to Chinese media reports, he thought the company was paying him far less than what he deserved for Subor’s success. 
 To this day, employees at BBK Electronics, Vivo, and Oppo hold a majority stake of over 60%. 
 Building a smartphone empire 
 In the beginning, BBK focused on three verticals: communication devices, audiovisual equipment, and education electronics. 
 In 1999, Duan spun them off into disparate business entities. 
 But not long after that, the audiovisual unit shuttered as China’s DVD industry suffered after foreign tech firms like Sony and Panasonic slapped hefty royalty fees for their technology. In 2001, the three divisions jointly established Oppo, with audiovisual employees joining the newly formed company. 
 Three years later, former audiovisual head Chen bought the brand rights. In its early years, Oppo focused on DVD and MP3 player businesses and forayed into making LCD televisions. 
 On the other hand, Vivo was formed by the communications division head Shen in 2009. The first Vivo phone was released in 2011. 
 
  A timeline of Oppo and Vivo’s evolution 
 
 To the public, the relationship between BBK, Oppo, and Vivo is complicated, to say the least. 
 The three entities operate independently, but “there are some common investors,” an Oppo spokesperson tells  Tech in Asia . However, she declined to elaborate further. 
 “Publicly, Oppo and Vivo and their subsidiaries are independent of BBK Electronics,” says Flora Tang, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. Tang explains that BBK is a shareholder of both companies, though exactly how much stake it holds is not publicly known. BBK was a major shareholder when Oppo and Vivo were established, but its stakes in both companies were likely reduced as other investors have come on board. 
 
  BBK Electronics’ structure, explained 
 
 Though they’re autonomous businesses, Vivo is a subsidiary while Oppo is a second-tier subsidiary financially controlled by BBK, according to industry expert Liu Yan. Every year, BBK still receives dividends from these two brands. 
 BBK holds influence in its subsidiaries in other ways. Staff and executives at Oppo and Vivo had spent years working for BBK. Liu Lei, who recently assumed the role of Oppo’s president for global marketing, was among the employees who followed Chen from BBK. 
 BBK’s DNA also runs deep in the veins of Oppo’s offshoot brands Realme and OnePlus as well as Vivo sub-brand iQoo. 
   
 Top brands in China 
 Chinese smartphone brands have seen a spectacular rise over the past few years. 
 In Q2 2019, they accounted for  42%  market share in the world, a new high. In the quarter before that, Oppo and Vivo were among the  the top six smartphone vendors  in the world. 
 Oppo and Vivo entered the smartphone market at a fortuitous time, when the appetite of China’s consumers was insatiable but the market was dominated by high-end smartphone producers Apple and Samsung. The Chinese brands targeted the mid-end segment and focused their efforts on third and fourth-tier cities.

 But the timing wasn’t the only factor that helped jumpstart their nascent smartphone businesses. 
 The resources, suppliers, sales channels, accumulated from BBK helped Oppo and Vivo get a footing in the smartphone market and fend off competitors. Without BBK’s backing and guidance, the two companies wouldn’t have been able to spend so generously on advertising and marketing, which have proven to be instrumental to their fast growth in China. 
 Both brands had a very slim product portfolio. In the beginning, Oppo had the flagship R and lower-end A series. As such, it was able to throw its marketing resources on its chief product, and sales spiked. 
 Once again, Duan’s flair for celebrity tie-ups was put to use. Vivo partnered with NBA China and was its official mobile handset sponsor in 2016, with basketball superstar Stephen Curry as its product ambassador. Similarly, Oppo teamed up with Brazillian football superstar Neymar Jr. in 2018 and is the main sponsor of the Indian national cricket team. 
 Oppo and Vivo have attributes in common that they imbibed from Duan: offering mid-range price points, catering to the younger consumers, combining online sales with offline marketing push, among others. The thinking behind having two brands was to create a friendly competitive environment for both to grow, Duan  said . 
 “Product differentiation” is key for the phonemakers, according to Oppo’s Liu. “While the two brands seemingly have the same positioning, they target different groups within that demographic,” he points out. 
 The strategy to zero in on specific consumers also resonates with Duan’s business philosophy of  ben fen , which can be translated as “one’s duty.” It calls for a business to focus on what it’s meant to be doing without straying. 
 Vivo and Oppo cater to the middle to mid-high end segment. OnePlus focuses on the tech-savvy, younger users, while Realme targets India and Southeast Asia. 
 Industry expert Liu Yan credits BBK’s culture for enabling Oppo and Vivo to make it this far. “ Ben fen  can be interpreted as making the money you’re supposed to make and serving the right customers well though making good products,” he explains. 
 Duan’s influence 
 In 2002, Duan retired and emigrated to the US to join his family. Since then, he devoted himself to investment and philanthropy. 
 But even from afar, he continued to influence China’s consumer tech landscape. 
 Duan is regarded as a mentor by many Chinese tech entrepreneurs. Apart from Oppo’s Chen and Vivo’s Shen, his protégés include Jin Zhijiang, BBK’s current CEO. His philosophy and accomplishments have also attracted Chinese tech entrepreneurs like NetEase’s Ding Lei and Pinduoduo’s Huang Zheng, among others. 
 When China’s dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, NetEase’s market cap plunged from US$ 470 million to below US$ 20 million. Duan famously bought around 2 million shares in NetEase, whose shares plummeted to as low as 48 cents per share. 
 NetEase founder Ding Lei went to Duan not for money but to seek advice on how to promote one of the company’s online video games. After speaking with Ding, Duan invested in NetEase. In 2003, NetEase bounced back from its darkest hour because of its soaring gaming business. Ding also became the richest man in China that year.

 Huang, founder of Pinduoduo, has spoke about Duan as his mentor on many occasions. The two got connected through NetEase’s Ding. After finishing his master’s degree in the US, Huang followed Duan’s advice and went to work for Google. When Google went public in 2004, Huang became a millionaire. 
 In 2007, Duan won a bid to have a charity lunch with Warren Buffett for US$620,000, and he brought along the then 26-year-old Huang. 
 Duan is also an investor in Pinduoduo. But even before Huang made a name for himself, Duan let him take over BBK’s ecommerce business and set up a platform Ouku.com, which sold consumer electronics products. 
 Since his retirement, Duan rarely makes public appearances, but the legend surrounding him and BBK will only grow with the rising popularity of Oppo and Vivo. 
 When they first came out, Oppo and Vivo products were derided as “cheap iPhone knockoffs” – just as Subor was mocked as a Famicom copycat. 
 “The best have no problem being the latecomers. They just do it better than everyone else,” Duan said at a  talk  with students at Stanford University in 2018. “The success of our company is not accidental… Slowly, we build a great reputation, which is very valuable in the long term,” he said.

647691,Uber to shut down regional headquarters in Singapore," Uber is shutting down its Asia-Pacific hub in Singapore as it winds down 45 offices globally and lays off 3,000 more employees in a business resizing exercise. 
 “Over the next 12 months, we will begin the process of winding down our Singapore office and moving to a new APAC hub in a market where we operate our services,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in an email to employees on Monday. The new market, however, was not specified.

 In 2019, a year after it had merged its Southeast Asia operations with regional rival Grab, Uber opened its Singapore office to oversee operations in nine countries: Australia, New Zealand, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. At the time, the office had 165 employees, according to one  account . 
 It was earlier reported that Uber will let go up to  700  staff in India, where it’s understood to employ a total of 2,000 workers. Earlier this month, the company said in a regulatory filing that it’s downsizing its total headcount by 14% or about 3,700 employees. 
 In addition to Singapore, Khosrowshahi said Uber is also shutting down an office in San Francisco, moving some of the employees to a new headquarters in the city. 
 Affected employees will be provided with severance packages, including healthcare coverage, according to the letter. 
 The chief exec also said that the company will be reducing investments in non-core projects and winding down its Incubator and AI Labs initiatives as part of its efforts to weather the Covid-19 crisis. 
 According to Khosrowshahi, the company is seeing an 80% drop in its ride-hailing business – its main profit driver – as people stay at home to mitigate the spread of the virus. He, however, noted with caution that Uber Eats is “doing great.” 
 “I will caution that while Eats growth is accelerating, the business today doesn’t come close to covering our expenses,” the CEO said. 
 Khosrowshahi reiterated that “hope is not a strategy” and that they have to make “hard actions” to secure the company’s future. 
 “I will not make any claims with absolute certainty regarding our future,” Khosrowshahi wrote. “I will tell you, however, that we are making really, really hard choices now, so that we can say our goodbyes, have as much clarity as we can, move forward, and start to build again with confidence.” ",Doris Yu,1,2,"[(3, 0.99965477)]","['Incubator', 'APAC']","['Bangladesh', 'Singapore', 'Taiwan', 'Khosrowshahi', 'India', 'Japan', 'Australia']"

 The food delivery startup will be providing affected individuals with at least three months of their salary, continued healthcare and wellness benefits until the end of the year, as well as relocation and career transition support, Swiggy CEO and co-founder Sriharsha Majety wrote. 
 The development comes as the company prepares for “worse scenarios” by cutting down on spending, which also includes reducing every single indirect cost like hubs and office infrastructure. 
 In addition, Swiggy will also be scaling down or shutting down adjacent businesses that it expects to be highly volatile or irrelevant for the next 18 months. 
 “The biggest impact here is on the cloud kitchens business, with many unknowns about volumes through the year,” Majety said. Last month, it was reported that the Bengaluru-based startup was letting go of around 1,000 staff across teams in its cloud kitchen division. 
 “We are already operating at significantly lower levels on our staffing and physical infra than our earlier footprint and will continue to optimize before we get more clarity on order volumes for food delivery,” the CEO said. 
 Recently, Swiggy’s rival Zomato also announced that it would be slashing about  13%  of its workforce to save cash. 
 “A large number of restaurants have already shut down permanently, and we know that this is just the tip of the iceberg,” Zomato founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal wrote in a blog post. Goyal also said he expects the number of restaurants to shrink by 25% to 40% over the next six to 12 months, limiting providers on food delivery and restaurant discovery platforms. 
 Amid the downsizing, however, Swiggy managed to secure additional funding from existing backer Samsung Ventures Investment. According to a report by  Entrackr , a regulatory filing shows that the South Korean VC firm has picked up roughly US$1.9 million worth of Swiggy’s series I shares. This pushes the startup’s total capital raised in the round to about US$42.4 million. 
 Swiggy has also passed a special resolution to appoint Tencent Investment managing director Daniel Joram Brody as a non-executive nominee director in the company’s board, according to the report.

 It has also announced a US$1 billion convertible note offering due 2025. Sea plans to use the proceeds from the offering for the cost of the  capped call transactions , business expansion, and potential strategic investments and acquisitions, according to its statement.

 The jump was mainly driven by the Singapore-based company’s digital entertainment segment, which grew its revenue 30.3% year on year to US$512 million. 
 The gaming and esports unit also saw its quarterly paying users balloon by 72.5% year on year to 35.7 million. The number already accounts for 8.9% of the segment’s overall quarterly users for the first quarter of 2020. 
 Sea said its self-developed game  Free Fire , published by its gaming platform Garena, has also recently hit a new record of over 80 million peak daily active users. It also reached a record high in monthly paying users in April this year. 
 Meanwhile, the company’s ecommerce segment drew in US$314 million in revenues for the quarter, up 111% year on year from US$149 million. The unit houses its online shopping platform Shopee. 
 Of this result, US$236.7 million came from marketplace revenue, or revenue generated from transaction-based fees, advertising, and other value-added services. The rest came from product revenue, which mainly consists of revenue from direct sales. 
 Sea also said the gross merchandise value for Shopee went up by 74.3% to US$6.2 billion for the first quarter of this year, compared to 64.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
 In Southeast Asia and Taiwan, Shopee ranked first in the shopping category by average monthly active users and total time spent in-app on Android, according to data from App Annie. Shopee also led the category in average monthly active users, downloads, and total time spent in-app on Android in Indonesia, its largest market. 
 Sea also said that it has been steadily growing its digital financial services arm SeaMoney, which recorded total payment volumes of over US$1 billion for the first quarter. Sea attributed this growth to the accelerating adoption of digital options as well as SeaMoney’s deepening integration with Shopee. 
 Overall, the company narrowed its net losses for the quarter to US$281 million compared to the US$689.6 million net loss it recorded in the same period last year. Its adjusted earnings, however, fell to a loss of nearly US$70 million compared to its US$32 million loss in the first quarter of 2019. 
 “The coronavirus crisis is driving a step-change in the growth of the digital economy globally, materially accelerating a shift to online lifestyles that is broad, deep, and, in our view, irreversible,” said Sea chairman and group CEO Forrest Li. 
 Li added that as Sea continues to respond to increased consumer demand and navigate disruptions to its businesses, it will be able to capitalize on expanded growth opportunities across its multiple fronts in the long run.

647624,Clarification and apology regarding Oyo," Dear readers, 
 On 16 May, we published a story alleging that Ritesh Agarwal is stepping down as the CEO of Oyo. Following that, we’ve received statements from Oyo and SoftBank Vision Fund denying this. 
 I made the call to publish the story after a discussion with the reporter. I also made the call to pull it soon after. In our haste to publish a story that was time-sensitive, it became apparent that while we based our story on trusted sources, we failed to perform a couple of steps that are essential in verifying sensitive information. 
 As such, I would like to apologize to Oyo, its shareholders, and employees for the trouble caused. I would also like to apologize for letting down our readers who trust us as a source of news. 
 Moving forward, we will revisit and improve our editorial process for sensitive stories, including updating our non-negotiable checklist built upon our existing best practices. 
 Our editorial mission and direction remain the same. We recognize the weight that our articles carry, and there is little room for error. We will do better.

 The investment follows the fintech startup’s  US$20 million  raise last month from existing investors Quona Capital, EV Growth, and Saison Capital, among others.

 Founded in 2015, Lendable provides commercial financing to companies across Africa and Asia, including small business lenders, consumer lenders, and asset finance firms. It has deployed over US$50 million to a number of fintech companies, with its investment into KoinWorks marking its first in Asia. 
 Mark Bruny, the chief financial officer of KoinWorks, said that Lendable’s investment proves there is still capital available for fintech lenders. 
 “As a company that focuses on productive sector funding, KoinWorks will aim this funding to strengthen digital small and medium-sized enterprises in Indonesia, […] particularly during this pandemic,” KoinWorks CEO and co-founder Benedicto Haryono said. 
 Through its platform, KoinWorks connects borrowers and lenders, providing SMEs with an alternative to traditional financial institutions. It claims to currently provide products such as business financing and invoice financing to over 400,000 businesses in Indonesia. 
 The startup recently took part in a fundraising initiative called  Indonesia Pasti Bisa . The East Venture-backed program aims to support the mass production of 100,000 Covid-19 test kits and research related to the novel coronavirus.

 Existing backer Heritas Capital and other individual investors also participated in the round, according to a statement.

 Founded in 2015, Holmusk aims to build a platform to expand data-driven, evidence-based care for people managing behavioral health conditions. 
 The company brings together health data and its analytics platform to generate evidence-based insights. Healthcare providers and patients can then use the information to make treatment decisions and provide better care for people with behavioral and chronic health needs. 
 The solution can also aid pharmaceutical companies in developing and commercializing new drugs, the company said. 
 With the investment, the firm plans to expand its US operations in New York City, adding on to its current offices in London and Shanghai. 
 In the future, Holmusk looks to invest in real-world data analysis to accelerate drug development and data-driven medicine, according to a statement. 
 In 2016, the company acquired MindLinc, an electronic health record system focused on behavioral health. The deal enabled Holmusk to leverage data from mental health institutions across the US. 
 In 2018, it raised nearly  US$9.8 million  in a pre-series A round from Heritas as well as new and existing investors. 
 Singapore’s healthcare market is expected to reach  S$29.8 billion (US$20.8 billion)   in 2020. Other players in the space include Doctor Anywhere, which just secured  US$27 million  in series B funding from Australian VC fund Square Peg, EDBI, IHH Healthcare, Pavilion Capital, and Kamet Capital.

647535,Indonesia to impose 10% digital services tax," Indonesia will impose a 10% value-added tax on digital services provided by non-resident companies starting July 1 as the government seeks to mitigate the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 According to the new  regulation , the tax applies to companies with a “significant economic presence” in the country, operating in sectors such as software, multimedia, and data.

 According to the finance ministry’s directorate general of taxes, digital products such as music and video streaming, apps, and games “will be treated [on a] level playing field as other local products that have been subject to VAT.” 
 The government said last month that it will tax companies such as US video streamer Netflix and Swedish music-streaming platform Spotify. 
 Indonesia’s digital economy is expected to grow to about  US$150 billion  by 2025, according to a report by McKinsey &amp; Co. However, the government did not see much state revenue from the space as many digital companies do not have a legal entity in the archipelago. 
 Proceeds from the tax will become a critical funding source to support Indonesia’s economy amid the pandemic, the country’s tax office said. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati previously  said  that digital companies have experienced sales growth during the pandemic. 
 Indonesia’s move comes after Singapore introduced a 7% tax for overseas digital services and Malaysia imposed  a 6% tax   on imported digital services from the start of this year.

The result was pulled down by a US$17.7 billion loss on valuation from investments held by its Vision Fund. 
 The Japanese conglomerate had earlier  forecasted  a US$12.1 billion operating loss and a US$16.7 billion loss on its tech fund.

 In an earnings release for the fiscal year ended March 31, SoftBank said the fair values of its big-ticket bets Uber and WeWork, as well as its other portfolio companies, plummeted during the fourth quarter primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 As of the fiscal year-end, SoftBank had US$75 billion in investments across 88 companies that are worth US$69.6 billion. The company said it has lost almost US$10 billion from its investments in Uber and WeWork alone in the fiscal year. 
 For its other portfolio companies, SoftBank reported a loss of about US$7.5 billion for the full year. The bulk of this loss came from the fourth quarter, with a total loss on valuation of almost US$9 billion. 
 The company said that its investments in the consumer sector took the biggest hit, with values declining by US$3.3 billion in the fourth quarter. It was followed by the transportation and logistics segment (excluding Uber) and the real estate and construction sector (excluding WeWork), which declined by US$2.4 billion and US$2.2 billion, respectively. 
 In the earnings call, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son warned that while some of its portfolio firms may make it to the other side of the pandemic, 15 of them might go bankrupt. He said that for those companies, “we will not provide financial support to rescue them.” 
 Earlier today, SoftBank announced plans to  repurchase  up to US$4.7 billion worth of its own stock from today to March 2021. This comes on top of the US$41 billion repurchase program it announced in March this year. 
 The company also revealed that Alibaba founder Jack Ma will be resigning as board director on June 25.

647510,"Indonesia’s Fore Coffee closes 16 stores, denies shutdown rumors"," Indonesia’s Fore Coffee has permanently closed 16 of its 133 outlets in the country in April as it adapts to the changing business conditions amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Another 45 outlets are also temporarily closed during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, according to co-founder and CEO Elisa Suteja. 
 “We closed several outlets and are in the process of selling assets related to these locations. The information circulating that Fore is permanently closing all locations is incorrect,” she said. 
  Tech in Asia  reached out to the company for comment after receiving a document listing Fore Coffee’s assets and their values. The company says a staff member had spread “inaccurate and partial information” about the company’s internal data, which led to false public perception.

 As Jakarta institutes large-scale social restrictions, Fore claims that it’s seeing a 12.8% increase in weekly online sales. It has also introduced both coffee and non-coffee beverages in one-liter packages, which can be purchased through the Fore Coffee app or ecommerce marketplaces like Tokopedia and Shopee. 
 Founded in 2018, the startup has  close links  to East Ventures. The Indonesian venture capital firm “incubated” Fore Coffee, which was inspired by China’s Luckin Coffee, in-house. 
 Its founders came from the firm’s network as well. Suteja was previously a senior analyst at East Ventures, while Robin Boe is a co-founder at Otten Coffee, another East Ventures portfolio company. 
 The VC firm then led Fore’s  US$8.5 million  series A round in January 2019, which was joined by the likes of SMDV, Pavilion Capital, and Agaeti Venture Capital. Citing strong growth in the first quarter of 2019, the company raised an additional  US$1 million  two months later. 
 By the middle of 2019 – less than a year after its founding – the company had grown to  58 outlets  across the Greater Jakarta area, serving an average of 300,000 cups of coffee per month. 
 But Indonesia’s coffee scene, long dominated by international brands like Starbucks, has seen a rise in new homegrown brands in the past few years. One of Fore’s main competitors is  Kopi Kenangan , which is similarly tech-enabled but offers localized beverages at a lower price point than Fore. 
 Kopi Kenangan, which claims to be profitable, has proven to be a strong fundraising force. Just last week, the company announced a  US$109 million  series B round led by Sequoia Capital, which follows a  US$20 million  series A round in July 2019. 
 As of this month, Kopi Kenangan said that it operates 324 stores across Indonesia while reaching 1 million customers through its mobile app. It expects to have 500 stores by the end of 2020, with plans to expand internationally once the Covid-19 pandemic ends.

647487,Ant Financial to pour $73.5m into Myanmar fintech firm Wave Money," Ant Financial has announced its plans to invest US$73.5 million in fintech firm  Wave Money  as part of a strategic partnership to boost financial inclusion in Myanmar. 
 The investment makes the Alipay operator a substantial minority stakeholder in Wave Money, alongside existing shareholders Yoma Group and Telenor, according to a statement.

 Founded in 2015 as a joint venture between Yoma and Telenor, Wave Money lets users send and receive money using their phones or through one of its 57,000 agents called “Wave Shops” scattered across urban and rural areas in Myanmar. 
 According to the statement, Wave Money is profitable, having become EBITDA-positive in 2018 and reaching US$4.3 billion in transfer volume in 2019. The company also said that over 21 million people have used its platform, with its monthly active user base growing by 14% month on month. 
 With the partnership, Wave Money plans to leverage Ant’s experience in mobile payments to enhance its digital competence, user experience, and services. This is in line with the Myanmar government’s plan to increase financial inclusion in the country from 48% to 60% by 2022. 
 “Myanmar is ready for mass adoption of digital payments with a connected population and high smartphone penetration,” said Wave Money CEO Brad Jones. 
 In a bid to strengthen its interest in Myanmar’s digital financial services sector, Yoma said it’s currently exploring the possibility of increasing its shareholding in Wave Money. 
 Melvyn Pun, Yoma’s CEO, said that they expect the partnership with Ant Financial to increase Wave Money’s capability to support the ongoing trend toward a cashless society and the accelerated growth of ecommerce brought on by Covid-19. 
 Since last year, Ant Financial has set its sights outside of its home market, investing in countries such as Vietnam, India, and Thailand. The company is also seeking a digital banking license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore after securing a similar license in Hong Kong.

646611,"After 9 applications, this startup won YC support to upskill engineers"," Engineering students who are fresh out of college  often struggle  to meet the expectations of their employers. More often than not, this stems from a gap between the skills they learned in school and those that are required to make them competitive in the workplace. 
  Skill-Lync , an edtech startup based out of Chennai, aims to bridge this gap. 
 
  Skill-Lync founders Suryanarayanan Paneerselvam (left) and Sarangarajan Iyengar / Photo credit: Skill-Lync 
 
 The company offers programs that provide engineering students in Asia with industry-relevant coursework developed by experts. 
 The startup was established in 2018 by CEO Suryanarayanan Paneerselvam and chief technology officer Sarangarajan Iyengar. But the duo first discovered the idea as early as 2013 while taking up their postgraduate degrees in mechanical engineering in the US. Back then, they experienced firsthand the drawbacks of India’s undergraduate programs, which often lacked application-based learning. 
 “We found it extremely difficult to cope with the expectations at our master’s degree,” Paneerselvam shares .  “And the interesting thing was, we found the same [thing] happening with all other Indian and Asian students who came to [the US to] pursue their master’s.” 
 Initially created as a YouTube channel, Skill-Lync was positioned as a business-to-business platform that provides value-added courses to higher-education institutions. After signing up 12 colleges to the platform within two years, Paneerselvam and Iyengar worked up the courage to quit their well-paying jobs and moved back to India in 2016 to scale the startup. 
  Engineering a bridge   
 Skill-Lync today has sales offices in Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Dusseldorf in Germany. It offers career programs in mechanical, electrical, electronics, and civil engineering, with its master’s course in electric vehicle design and simulations soon to be released. 
 Interested students can avail of a live demo before enrolling in its courses, which cost about US$3,000 on average. 
 According to Paneerselvam, what sets Skill-Lync apart is its 24/7 live support for students. “You can have a great course taught by one of the best experts in the world, but if the student does not understand the first two videos/classes, then he will not complete the coursework,” the CEO says. 
 The one-to-one support feature allows the company to better understand its students and answer their questions directly. This has helped Skill-Lync achieve a course completion rate of around 77%, well above the industry average of 8% to 15%, Paneerselvam says.

 Skill-Lync targets students who are 18 to 26 years old. About 8 million engineers in India fall within this range, representing a market size of around US$18 billion in the country alone. 
 “Our focus is to help non-software engineers accelerate their careers. This is important because in India, more than 70% of engineers are non-software engineers,” Paneerselvam adds. 
 Currently, the startup is going up against established brands in the space such as Udemy, Coursera, and Udacity. 
 Other players include Bengaluru-based  InterviewBit , which recently secured  US$20 million  in its series A round earlier this year, and  CollegeDekho , which connects students with prospective colleges and courses across India. 
 Skill-Lync, meanwhile, is backed by Better Inc. CEO and founder Vaibhav Domkundwar, Gmail founder Paul Buccheit, and global accelerator Y Combinator. 
 Getting into YC was an uphill battle, says Paneerselvam. “Sarang and I applied [to Y Combinator] eight times,” he says. “We got rejection letters all the eight times, but we never let it affect us.” 
 After five years, Skill-Lync got accepted into the YC Winter 2019 batch. 
 The startup also raised capital last year, but the firm has kept the amount undisclosed. 
 Right now, Skill-Lync is not actively looking to acquire further funding, but the chief exec says that the company may look to raise US$15 million if it does decide to pursue a series A round. The amount raised could be used for coursework development, product development, and marketing. 
 Skill-Lync is currently cash-flow positive, with a net profit of 21%, adds Paneerselvam. 
 “Over the last 18 months, we have grown 21% month over month in terms of revenue,” the CEO says, adding that they have increased their revenue sevenfold compared to the same period last year. 
 The company expects these numbers to trend upward during the year as the Covid-19 pandemic drives online learning adoption. It saw student enrollments climb 5x last month, a trend it expects to continue in May.

 The investment pushes Jio’s total capital raised just in the last four weeks to roughly US$8.9 billion after securing funds from Facebook, Silver Lake, and Vista Equity Partners. It also gives the RIL subsidiary an equity value of close to US$65 billion and an enterprise value of over US$68 billion.

 It is now proposing the appointment of three new board members, including SoftBank chief financial officer Yoshimitsu Goto. Other candidates are Lip-Bu Tan, the CEO of US-based chipmaker Cadence and the founder of venture capital firm Walden International, and Waseda Business School professor Yuko Kawamoto. 
 SoftBank also announced its plans to repurchase up to 500 billion yen (US$4.7 billion) worth of its own stock from today to March 2021, which is on top of a US$41 billion repurchase program it announced in March, according to a statement. 
 “The buyback announcement is a surprise, given the slew of low expectations and bad news,” Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners, told  Bloomberg . 
 The company earlier said that it was expecting a  US$12 billion  operating loss for the year ended March 31, 2020 as its tech investments decline in value and the market deteriorates. It has forecast a US$16.7 billion loss on its Vision Fund and a US$7.4 billion loss on other investments. 
 Many of its big tech bets have been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Indian budget hotel chain Oyo has furloughed or placed its employees on temporary leave as it saw its revenue and occupancies drop by up to  60% . Uber has also laid off about  3,700  employees as it sees lower trip volumes in its ride-hailing segment.

647441,"After 1.8 billion downloads, a file-sharing app makes a big pivot"," With over 1.8 billion downloads,  Shareit  is one of  the most popular Google Play apps of all time , according to App Annie. 
 That’s quite an achievement for an app that many may not have heard of. Shareit started in China in 2013 as a built-in software for Lenovo smartphones and was spun off (for undisclosed reasons) as a separate company two years later, with Michael Qiu as CEO. 
 Despite being headquartered in Beijing, the company’s largest market is India, followed by Indonesia. In reality, Shareit has “zero users” and “makes no money” in China, says Karam Malhotra, the firm’s global vice president and India CEO.

 Shareit saw a positive reception in India since it launched there seven years ago. This led to the company shifting its expansion plans to the country, where it gained 150 million users within a year. 
 In March 2015, the company closed an early-stage fundraise,  according to PitchBook . Chinese venture capital firms Addor Capital and Legend Capital, the corporate venture arm of Lenovo’s majority shareholder Legend Holdings are listed as investors, but it’s not stated if they took part in the round, or backed Shareit later. 
 The company declined to comment on its funding history or earnings, saying it doesn’t disclose any financial information. 
 Feeding a data-hungry population 
 Shareit became known for its convenience and speed in transferring huge files in areas hampered by poor network connectivity and slow internet bandwidth. 
 “Indians struggled to access content as internet access was either scarce, too slow, or patchy. At the same time, data was also too expensive,” says Malhotra. “So rather than watching videos off the internet, Indians relied on sharing content, such as TV shows, movies and music with each other using Shareit.” 
 Shareit has also become a major platform for distributing apps in India. According to the company, almost half of its users in the country don’t have a Gmail account, which means they have no access to Android’s app store. 
 Here’s how it works: The app creates a direct Wi-Fi connection that allows users to share software, movies, and games of up to 20 gigabytes in size – without internet access. It does so with speeds that are 200 times faster than Bluetooth, with the highest download speed going up to 20 megabytes per second, according to Shareit’s description on Apple’s App Store. Using the app requires that both sender and receiver be in close proximity for a seamless file transfer, enabled by strength and stability of their Wi-Fi signal. 
 “Shareit has lots of ‘ stickiness .’ We provided a solution when many others couldn’t. [And because] we gave such a strong user case for millions of people in India, Shareit’s value is much stronger,” explains Malhotra. 
 The company says that it serves over 600 million monthly active users (MAUs). As of Q1 this year, Shareit was in ninth place on App Annie’s list of leading apps by MAUs in India and Indonesia. The ranking combines iPhone and Android users. 
   
 Shareit’s usage statistics puts it in the same league as Chinese consumer apps TikTok and Bigo, which have gained strong traction outside of their home country. And while Shareit has over 300 employees in China and 100 employees in India, it considers the South Asian country as its most important market. 
 “ShareIt was founded by Chinese folks, but we call ourselves an Indian company,” says Jason Wong, the firm’s India managing director. “We don’t call ourselves a Chinese company because if we lose the India market, we need to shut our business down.” 
 Turning the tide 
 In the world of consumer apps, change is constant. Even as Shareit maintains its popularity as a file-sharing app, a number of trends are blunting its edge. 
 Third-party estimates seen by  Tech in Asia  show that Shareit’s MAU numbers have plateaued since February 2018, suggesting that the company’s growth may have hit a wall. The firm declined to comment on the findings but says it keeps tabs on the number of active users. 
 “According to statistics from Google Play, less than 5% of users uninstall our app on a monthly basis. That’s very low compared to that of other apps, which can see up to 90% of users uninstalling shortly after downloading it,” notes Malhotra. 
 Even so, the competition may be catching up. In a  Tech in Asia  trial of Shareit, a download reached a peak speed of 20 MB/s, but some users complained of sluggish speeds in reviews posted on Google Play Store. The company says this could be due to the  distance between devices  or interference as a result of too many WiFi signals. We also tested a similar app called  Xender , and it reached a peak speed of 40MB/s. 
 Malhotra didn’t comment on Xender, but he said that since Shareit fulfills a “wide array” of functions besides file-sharing, it’s “fair” to say that the company does not have direct competitors. 
 But the most serious game changer for Shareit is how previously data-shy Indians are now consuming media more liberally. Thanks to the intense competition following the launch of telecommunications firm Reliance Jio in 2016, people gained access to cheaper mobile internet plans. 
 “People used [Shareit] on Android to share movies and video songs and music. [That’s changing] with Jio, [which] gave out free data, before switching to charging low fees. Now everyone just streams,” says a person who lives in Mumbai. 
 Shareit is attempting its biggest evolution yet in a bid to stay relevant. And the first order of business is to make money. 
 Move to monetization 
 In 2018, the company decided to ramp up ad monetization efforts, which Malhotra says were “non-existent” previously. He joined the firm as its India CEO, after Shareit acquired his startup Fastfilmz, an over-the-top (OTT) platform that showcases south Indian films. Shareit wasn’t generating much revenue back then. 
 “We had 200 million MAUs globally when we were deciding to monetize, but we found out that 90% of marketeers out there didn’t know us,” says Malhotra. Today, Shareit generates revenue via brand campaigns with fast-moving consumer goods and ecommerce players as well as food and beverage companies through ad banners and videos on its app.

 Apart from running more ad campaigns, Malhotra says his team will make a stronger push to persuade users to share and install “related” apps to people who got Sharedit based on their recommendation. 
 Over the years, Shareit has become a major distribution channel for apps. Over 1 billion app installations, which include those from ecommerce and gaming companies, take place on its platform every month. 
 Malhotra thinks this is because almost half of its user base don’t have access to Android’s app store. Instead, they rely on family members to share app installation files with them. Users also learn about new apps by word of mouth. 
 “From user behavior, we know who’s using e-wallet apps and transacting online, so we can definitely help such apps extend their reach by marketing related apps to [such] users,” he adds. 
 Shareit is working with 200 apps on such solutions globally. “We offer app-sponsored installs, recommendations, based on what we think they would be interested in. It’s powerful. As for users, they find it valuable,” says Mahotra. 
 Super app ambitions? 
 Apart from its monetization plans, Shareit is now a YouTube of sorts, offering free premium OTT content to users in India through tie-ups with global media titans such as Viacom and Times Music. 
 Malhotra also tells  Tech in Asia  that Shareit is looking to expand into mobile payments – a move that echoes Reliance Jio’s rollout of JioMoney in 2016. Does this mean the file-sharing app wants to be a super app? 
 Not necessarily. “The move to e-payments is very much a strategy to reinforce our app-game distribution,” he explains, shying away from the label that industry observers have applied to its peers like Paytm, Ola and Flipkart. Instead, Shareit is developing a “supporting app” to help players “make in-game purchases such as items and coins.” 
 Users still rely on the app mainly for its file-sharing function, according to the company. A person living in Jakarta tells  Tech in Asia  that people often use it to send pirated music or videos that were downloaded from YouTube to their friends. Another user in Indonesia said his family members used it to transfer data from their old phones to their new ones. 
 We want to work with more Call of Duties and Garenas… 
 Shareit also says that it’s now “banking big on its gaming audience” across Southeast Asia, where its users are growing “300 to 400%” per annum. A big chunk of its revenue in the region already comes from advertising for other applications, but it seeks to tap into advertising services for gaming apps, such as those from Singapore-based Garena. 
 Malhotra says the advertising potential for Southeast Asia’s gaming companies is “largely untapped.” There are about 100 gaming apps already on Shareit’s platform that are “relatively doing very well.”

 Shareit hosts “simpler” games such as Subway Surfers and Hill Climb Racing on its game center, allowing casual players easy access on the go. But the firm realizes that “not everyone is into  ‘hypercasual’ games . 
 “We want to focus on hardcore games, such as first-person shooting games – those that we can’t host on our simple gaming platform. We’ll help would-be users discover them so that they can download and play them separately,” explains Malhotra. 
 Circling back to its unique selling point, Shareit says it wants to capitalize on its quick download speeds, which can download a 2 GB game like  PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds  in “under 45 seconds.” 
 “That’s the power of us working closer with hardcore game companies, because their files are very large,” Malhotra observes. “When we embark on our next phase, we want to work with more  Call of Duties  and Garenas. We believe this is a great opportunity.” ",Joseph Gan,0,7,"[(2, 0.9997655)]","['PitchBook', 'app', 'OTT', 'Garena', 'Sharedit', 'Ola', 'iPhone', 'MAU', 'WiFi', 'Malhotra', 'Gmail', 'Paytm', 'Viacom', 'Android', 'Apple', 'Flipkart', 'PlayerUnknown', 'Lenovo']","['Mumbai', 'Singapore', 'Garenas', 'Shareit', 'Asia', 'YouTube', 'India', 'Beijing', 'Indonesia', 'China', 'Jakarta']"

 In a blog post, Zomato founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal said the India-based startup will be providing affected employees with half of their salaries and continued health insurance support for six months or until they find a new job. 
 Though Zomato did not disclose how many workers it’s letting go, the number falls close to 500, according to a  TechCrunch  report. 
 Goyal said that Zomato has been “severely affected” by the global lockdown measures that came with the ongoing crisis. 
 “A large number of restaurants have already shut down permanently, and we know that this is just the tip of the iceberg,” he wrote, adding that he expects the number of restaurants to shrink by 25% to 40% over the next six to 12 months. India has been on lockdown since March 24. 
 With this, the chief exec said that Zomato aims to make a “complete shift towards being a transactions-first company,” focusing on a small number of large market opportunities. 
 In addition to the layoffs, Goyal also proposed a temporary pay cut for the entire company. “Lower cuts are being proposed for people with lower salaries, and higher cuts (up to 50%) for people with higher salaries,” he said. 
 Less than two months ago, Goyal  said  on Twitter that hundreds of Zomato employees have already taken deep voluntary pay cuts at the time to help the company conserve cash. 
 Zomato archrival Swiggy has also made similar moves in an effort to weather the crisis. Last month, it was reported that the Bengaluru-based startup was letting go around 1,000 staff, mostly from its cloud kitchen business.

 Founded in 2015 by Mei Siauw and Angelo Huang, LeadIQ seeks to simplify lead management and sales prospecting processes for businesses. 
 “Every second that a rep is wasting on repetitive tasks [and] chasing the wrong prospect is not only hurting their company, but our economy as well,” Siauw, CEO of LeadIQ, said. 
 The company’s platform connects to sales engagement and consumer relationship management platforms. It then sends prospect data to them as salespeople browse the web. It can support Salesoft, Outreach, HubSpot, and Salesforce. 
 Some of LeadIQ’s existing clients include TripActions, Showpad, and Sendoso, among others, according to a statement. 
 The company will use the new funds to further invest in product research and development, build out its team in Singapore, and expand in Southeast Asia. 
 It currently has over 60 employees across three offices in San Francisco, New Hampshire, and Singapore, but the company said it’s now focusing on the Southeast Asian market, with 60% of its staff based in the Asian city-state.

 MRT Jakarta is a government-owned company formed to operate Jakarta’s mass rapid transit systems. The first subway service in the archipelago, it started operations in March last year. 
 Its new initiative,  dubbed MRT Jakarta Accel,  welcomes startups with innovative products or services, with the end goal of commercializing these solutions together with MRT Jakarta. 
 “Since this is our first accelerator program, we don’t focus on [any particular] industry, so all startups are encouraged to apply,” MRT Jakarta head of business expansion Nicodemus Winata told  Tech in Asia.   
 Through the six-month program, selected startups will gain access to MRT Jakarta’s mobility ecosystem, including its passengers, station facilities, vehicles, and transit-oriented development areas around its stations. 
 They will also be mentored by the MRT Jakarta team and other members of the Asian startup community, including those from Bukalapak, BeliMobilGue, BRI Ventures, MDI Ventures, East Ventures, and Vertex Ventures. 
 Although direct funding from the company will not be part of the program, MRT Jakarta Accel hopes to open up more investment opportunities for the participating companies, Winata said. 
 Interested startups may apply starting June 8. To qualify, they must at least have a viable product and a team comprising of Indonesian citizens. MRT Jakarta is set to announce the qualified startups on July 30. 
 As part of the integration process, participating startups are expected to finalize the business model of their projects, which must be geared towards revenue creation. MRT Jakarta may consequently offer long-term agreements with startups based on the performance of their projects. 
 “Startups have brought many new solutions or services to Indonesia […] MRT Jakarta believes [that] through collaboration with startups, MRT Jakarta can solve mobility-related problems faster and more efficiently,” the company said on its website. 
 The company has earlier formed partnerships with startups such as Gojek, Grab, Ovo, and Moka for coordination of pick-up and drop-off points, payments, and point-of-sale services.

 It also plans to expand to New York and London as well as develop a marketplace that supports currencies in Group of Ten or emerging economies, with a data center located in Singapore. 
 According to  Bloomberg , the startup recorded an average of US$5.5 billion in per-day trading volume in the first quarter of this year, up from US$2.5 billion in 2019. But the economic slowdown brought by the Covid-19 crisis is starting to affect its second quarter, pushing down the average trading volume to between US$4.5 billion and US$5 billion a day.

646813,"When fundraising during Covid-19, consider these tips before signing the contract"," The unprecedented crisis caused by Covid-19 has altered global economic activity. 
 Investors, like everyone else, are affected too: Angel investors are likely to be distracted from doing deals and VCs might feel cautious about deploying capital. All these lead to less cash for startups.

 If your startup is in the middle of raising capital, here are things to consider, depending on the stage of the fundraising process you’re in. 
 If you have a term sheet 
 The most important thing to remember is that a term sheet is nonbinding. While investors do not typically sign term sheets and then withdraw for market reasons, we are in unusual times. Investors can walk away without any reason, which can cause major disruption to a fundraising process. 
 If you are in the process of receiving and negotiating term sheets, a good tip is to keep any exclusivity period to a minimum, e.g., no more than 30 days. Thus, if an investor starts to waver, the company can move on quickly to other opportunities. 
 Another tip is to structure the deal in a way that it can be closed quickly. Consider limiting the number of investors and instead keep existing shareholders up to speed so paperwork can be executed without delays. 
 If you’ve signed an investment document but the deal is yet to be completed 
 While investors are legally bound to close a deal and fund a company once they have signed on, share subscription agreements always include a clause that makes the fulfillment of an investment contingent on certain conditions. 
 These conditions often involve a provision for material adverse effect (MAE), which essentially allows investors to withdraw from a fundraising deal should there be a change that impacts a business or its financial performance in a material way. 
 Such clauses do not just cover deterioration in the financial performance of the business, but also include almost anything that materially affects its operations: termination of a key license, a change in the law, or a company’s inability to deliver services as before. 
 The pandemic is, of course, affecting not just economic activity but is also forcing governments to implement new measures on a daily basis, so whether Covid-19 could be cited as an MAE trigger depends on how a provision is drafted. 
 How big of a deal is an MAE in a fundraising transaction? It’s possibly not a major concern in the case of startups and fundraising deals. 
 Unlike mergers and acquisitions where there are often long periods between signing and closing, investors and startups tend to wrap things up quickly when financing deals. 
 Signing and completion usually occur simultaneously or within a few days of each other, leaving little to no time for an investor to withdraw on the basis of an MAE. The exception is when there is a “rolling close” on financing deals, i.e., further money would be invested after a period of time. 
 Even if investors are legally bound to provide funding as part of a later tranche, the MAE clause could still come into play at that time and allow investors to withdraw. 
 For an investor to pull out of a transaction on the grounds of an occurring MAE, it clearly needs to have happened after the deal had been signed. Since everybody has long been aware of the Covid-19 outbreak, it would be fair for startups to adjust what general market deterioration now means in the context of an MAE and exclude from it the overall economic impact of the pandemic, including the effects of the measures implemented by governments in response to the crisis. 
 In this case, an investor would have to prove that there was another specific change that has caused an MAE after signing. This could happen if the clause specifies a certain percentage of deterioration in business earnings as a trigger. 
 Other tips to consider when fundraising during a crisis 
 Review warranties carefully 
 Warranties provided by a fundraising company or its founders usually cover the period only up to when a deal is closed, though there are deals that have extended warranty terms in reference to a startup’s business plan. 
 In the current economic climate, it is virtually impossible for a startup to accurately project its trajectory even over the next six months, so companies should avoid offering extended warranties as much as they can. 
 Avoid tranched investments and key performance indicators 
 Now is the right time to get money into the business, and investments that are conditional on financial performance are best avoided. Startups would be better off raising a full amount of investment at a slightly lower valuation than going with tranches and key performance indicators. 
 Watch out for redemption or buyback rights 
 Investors sometimes include redemption or buyback rights in a deal. These entitle them to get their money back under certain circumstances, usually some kind of “event of default” by the company or its founders. 
 Occasionally, investors have redemption rights that can also be enforced in other scenarios: If a startup fails to complete a restructuring or obtain a new license to operate; if its financial performance deteriorates; or if it’s unable to deliver under a separate commercial arrangement. 
 But in this unpredictable period, including these rights in a deal brings considerable uncertainty and risk to startups and therefore should be avoided. 
 While the pandemic is a black swan event, it shouldn’t put off ventures that are looking for money. It’s simply a case of being wise about the fundraising process and knowing how to deal with the changing times – including the changing terms for transactions.

647352,"A roadmap for online travel’s long, painful path to recovery"," Five months into the Covid-19 pandemic, at least one online travel company in Southeast Asia has  shut down . The rest face cratering revenues and are making both ends meet by cutting costs. But since the economic fallout from this  black swan event  will likely be felt for some time, there are limits to this strategy. 
 As such, the questions have turned existential. Will online travel companies even survive this crisis? 
 
  Photo credit: 123RF 
 
 For the most part, the answer is yes, according to Aldi Hartanto, vice president of investments at MDI Ventures. He’s confident that the major online travel agencies (OTAs) – Traveloka, Tiket.com, and Trip.com Group, among others – will pull through, but he has his doubts about the prospects of smaller players. 
 That said, Hartanto estimates that for OTAs to stay in the game, they need to shore up a runway of 18 to 24 months. Emergency fundraising or in more dire cases, a merger with a bigger and deep-pocketed player, might be in order. 
 “Founders and existing shareholders will have to expect significant dilution and lower returns,” he says. Along with valuation cuts, the investment horizon will be “much longer” in order to recover growth and market perception towards the industry. 
 Given that a full recovery may take a year or longer, these businesses may need to rethink their model from the ground up. Whether OTAs choose to pivot, go with an investment or be acquired, it won’t be easy and the cost may be high. 
 The M&amp;A or PE route 
 According to Hartanto, the companies with the best chances for survival have relatively straightforward traits. They have big cash balances and low debt as well as robust gross profit margins and operating cash flows. They’re also less people-centric, which means lower fixed costs and less operational exposure. 
 Those that fall into this category are the likes of Traveloka (close to US$1 billion in disclosed funding); Trip.com Group (US$1 billion in net profit for 2019); and Tiket.com (backed by Indonesian conglomerate Djarum). Assuming healthy internal financials, they should at least have a sizable cash balance and existing investors who can inject capital when necessary. 
 But there may also be instances where an investment from current backers may not be feasible. Sean O’Neill, a travel tech editor at  Skift , uses Klook as an example. The Hong Kong-based travel experiences platform raised a  US$225 million series D+ round  led by SoftBank Vision Fund last year, but the Japanese conglomerate is still grappling with the  WeWork debacle  and  troubles  at Indian hospitality startup Oyo. 
 
  (L-R): Klook founders Bernie Xiong, Ethan Lin, and Eric Gnock Fah / Photo credit: Klook 
 
 O’Neill says that Klook can make it if it manages its cash flow well. But should it need an infusion of capital, and SoftBank or other investors can’t participate, then one avenue to consider is a merger or an outright sale. 
 For Klook, the likely buyers would be Trip.com Group or Alibaba, which owns travel marketplace  Fliggy . SoftBank may also choose to merge Klook with one of its portfolio companies, such as  GetYourGuide , a Berlin-based OTA that also markets travel experiences. 
 “TripAdvisor, another major seller of tours and activities, doesn’t seem financially able to acquire companies right now, and neither does Expedia Group,” observes O’Neill. “Booking Holdings sold some of its equity in Trip.com Group recently, so it may not be thinking of  tuck-in acquisitions .” 
 Consolidation may not lead to the ideal outcome of ‘1+1=3’ or even ‘1+1=2.’ 
 According to Hartanto, several venture capital firms are exploring M&amp;As or consolidation for their travel-related portfolio companies, but most of the others are “laser-focused” on their own. “All travel-related startups have significant probability to not survive this pandemic, so they already have too much on their plate,” he says. 
 Many are cautious that any OTA or travel-related consolidation at this time will not lead to the ideal outcome of “1+1=3” or even “1+1=2,” Hartanto says. Each entity would be bringing their own liabilities and other troubles to the table. A post-deal integration, for instance, would be a headache even without pandemic-related complications. 
 “That way, [M&amp;A] will potentially bring more chaos,” he adds. “Most of the players don’t want to take the risk of doing M&amp;A in the middle of this.”

 The more likely route would perhaps be through a private equity cash injection. Silicon Valley PE firm Silver Lake Partners has invested US$1 billion in Airbnb’s debt securities, and together with Apollo Global Management, injected US$1.2 billion into Expedia. 
 This approach does come with caveats. Hartanto says PE firms will be looking for a bargain, and as companies need cash, investments will come via the issuance of new shares. 
 In Airbnb’s case, the debt financing comes with high interest rates of between  11% to 12% . The short-stay rental company also awarded the investors the right to buy shares at a valuation of US$18 billion. That’s significantly lower than its valuation of  US$31 billion  at the time of its last funding round in 2017. 
 Most of the players don’t want to take the risk of doing M&amp;A in the middle of this. 
 As for Expedia,  analysts say  that the arrival of PE firms would bring more cost discipline and focus on restructuring while also increasing the odds of a sale once the economy restarts. 
 Even then, cash is still king. Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban  said  that his firm invested in Airbnb and Expedia because both companies have strong cash positions. The bet, he says, is that the economy will bounce back before the cash runs dry. 
 Impact on business model 
 The pandemic will no doubt affect existing business models. For online hotel operators like Oyo and RedDoorz, a short-term solution would be to ask their hotel partners to shift from an inventory model to a revenue-sharing one. This is the path that RedDoorz has  followed  while also slashing costs, but Hartanto wonders if it will be enough. 
 “Fundamentally, traffic will remain low,” he says. “The other strategy is to shift from short-term to long-term stay, but [that demand also] remains low.” (To its credit, RedDoorz claims it has enough funds to last it through 2022.) 
 For OTAs, the ramifications may be larger. 
 Two of the three predominant business models are the agency (traditionally used by Booking.com) and the merchant (traditionally used by Agoda) approaches. Under the merchant framework, an OTA purchases hotel rooms in bulk – at a price cheaper than the  rack rates  – before reselling them to travelers. In the agency setup, the OTA charges the hotel a commission only when a booking is made. 
 O’Neill thinks that in theory, Covid-19 may put more pressure on players with a merchant model, as they would be liable for canceled bookings instead of the hotel. 
 “In the agency model, the hotelier is more on the hook in facing the crunch of refunds,” he says.

 O’Neill notes, however, that the explanation above is an “oversimplification.” Hartanto also points out that the top OTAs have improved their bargaining power in recent years, given the size of their traffic and a behavioral shift among consumers towards online bookings. To the MDI executive’s knowledge, major OTAs like Traveloka or Tiket.com operate a hybrid model – these companies run on a merchant model for high-demand inventory, and use the agency model for the rest. 
 “Top OTAs usually have a pretty fast inventory turnover, so the exposure shouldn’t be that high,” Hartanto says. The issue is more that the merchant model requires bigger operational teams, which bring on added costs. 
 That said, the agency model’s primary drawback is margins, which are thinner due to their asset-light operations, according to Hartanto. This makes such companies relatively vulnerable to swings in revenue. 
 In theory, Covid-19 may put more pressure on players with a merchant model. 
 “For OTAs, this situation certainly pushes them to pick the best of the worst,” he adds. “Any decision will always have a material downside.” 
 After the pandemic, there’s also a broader question on whether consumers will avoid OTAs that use merchant model. O’Neill says that hoteliers generally only offer discounted rates to OTAs if they buy in bulk or accept restrictions such as non-refundability. But with Covid-19 in the picture, travel restrictions may come and go over the next year or so, and consumers may not want to subject themselves to non-refundable bookings . 
 OTAs are exposed to risk as well. Purchasing large numbers of inventory on volume discounts ahead of time would make them less flexible to swings in supply and demand, which may happen due to on-again, off-again travel bans. 
 Still, “we don’t know what will happen,” O’Neill says. 
 A protracted recovery 
 It’s very unlikely for OTAs to find revenue channels that are not affected by Covid-19, Hartanto says. To stay afloat, there isn’t much that they can do except to reduce operating costs. Aside from layoffs, pay cuts, and furloughs, OTAs are renegotiating payment schedules, collecting accounts receivables, and implementing a “cockroach” mentality by shifting nonproductive teams to run revenue-generating initiatives. 
 Other firms are trying the time-honored pivot. 
 For example, Klook has launched initiatives focused on the food and leisure verticals. It has partnered with Lalamove in Hong Kong, combining its network of restaurant partners with the logistics startup’s on-demand delivery service. The Indonesian proptech startup  Travelio , whose main business is in short-term apartment rentals, recently launched an online supermarket dubbed TravelioMart. 
 While recovery still seems a long way for most countries, China can provide an idea of what a restart would look like. Ctrip.com’s visits had plummeted from 37.2 million in December 2019 to 12.9 million by February 2020, according to  SimilarWeb  estimates. But it has since stabilized, with the company recording an estimated 13.8 million visits in April 2020.

 A trends report released by Trip.com Group, which owns Ctrip.com, also indicates that travelers in China are shifting from inter-provincial and outbound travel to local tourism. Klook is employing a similar approach. It has an agreement with local governments in Taiwan to expand domestic travel and is keeping an eye out for pockets of recovery in other markets, according to Marcus Yong, the company’s vice president of marketing. 
 “I will say even for the next three to six months, it would be a progressive improvement,” Yong says. “[It will] start with domestic travel and then open up to regional travel, and eventually global.” 
 Local travel may also be something that Traveloka can take advantage of, thanks to its  Experiences product . 
 But while Hartanto believes this would be a good start, flights and hotels are still Traveloka’s primary revenue drivers. Recovering that lost traction will still be a long way off.

647298,South Korean AI startup Aizen nets $4.2m to expand in Southeast Asia,"  Aizen , a fintech-focused AI company based in South Korea, announced that it has raised US$4.2 million in a series B funding round led by SEMA Translink Investment, a venture capital firm that has also backed local online grocer Kurly. 
 Korea Growth Investment, a fund-of-funds investment firm, also participated in the round.

 The latest investment brings its total capital raised to US$9 million, including US$2 million in research and development grants and a previous funding round from Woori Bank, according to the startup. 
 The company will use the new funds to expand internationally and roll out its AI banking-as-a-service product throughout Southeast Asia. 
 The new service is designed to allow companies to launch banking services faster, boost customer retention, and diversify their revenue streams through its APIs. It can also help banks reach more customers without high marketing and IT costs, Aizen said. 
 Founded in 2016, the company uses AI to automate the decision-making processes in banking, retail payment, and insurance. With its proprietary automated machine learning platform called Abacus, it offers several AI-powered solutions primarily for the financial services sector. 
 For example, its Credit to Map technology integrates several sources of data, such as ecommerce sites or e-wallets, and convert them into credit information (i.e., a person’s ability to pay, willingness to pay, etc.). The data will then be used to automate decision-making processes in the entire credit life cycle from planning and risk assessment to collection. 
 The startup said its mission is to redesign digital banking with automated machine learning technology. Its users include financial institutions such as Woori Bank, Hyundai Card, and Samsung Marine and Fire Insurance, according to a statement. Aizen was part of the first batch of the Plug and Play fintech accelerator for Asia Pacific.

 Other US investment funds such as Elysium Ventures and Kairos K50, as well as angel investors from Facebook and Snapchat, also participated in the round, according to a statement.

 Founded by former Lazada exec Andrew Koger, the Manila-based startup offers a suite of home services such as home cleaning, laundry delivery, and repairs. At the same time, it also helps small entrepreneurs and gig workers find new customers by taking their businesses online. 
 With the Covid-19 pandemic, the company has also added special disinfection cleaning services to its offerings. 
 GoodWork said it will be using the fresh capital to fuel its growth and expand across Southeast Asia. It also looks to make additional hires over the next 12 months to support its plans, Koger told  Tech in Asia . 
 “We see a great opportunity in major urban areas across Southeast Asia, and we are particularly excited to expand into Vietnam and Thailand in late 2020 or early 2021,” he said. 
 With the rapid growth of mobile internet penetration and ecommerce spending in the Philippines, the company said it sees great growth potential in building a platform specialized for the services economy. 
 GoodWork claims that in its first year of operations, it already handles 10,000 jobs a month, with 70% of daily bookings coming from repeat customers. 
 With its expansion plans in the region, the company is poised to go up against Rocket Internet-backed Helpling, an online platform that lets users book vetted and insured cleaners. 
 The Berlin-based company entered Singapore in 2015. After raising about  US$22.3 million  in investments, Helpling said it’s eyeing expansion into new markets including Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam this year.

647229,"Indonesia’s Pintek raises funds to reach students, schools hit by Covid-19","  Pintek , an Indonesian fintech company that provides credit to both students and educational institutions, announced that it has secured funding from Accion Venture Lab, the seed-stage fintech investment initiative of Accion. 
 The startup didn’t disclose the funding amount, but said that the investment was part of its pre-series A round. Last year, it said it received  pre-series A funding  led by Rocket Internet-backed Global Founders Capital. 
 The company plans to use the latest investment to expand its technology and platform to meet the needs of underserved students and schools affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a statement.

 In Indonesia, most students and schools have limited access to financing, Pintek said. Private schools, which make up more than half of the country’s total secondary institutions and 90% of its colleges and universities, often lack the ability to provide adequate collateral in order to access long-term loans to improve their facilities and hire staff. 
 Meanwhile, whereas the average Indonesian family of four makes about US$222 per month, tertiary education averages from US$1,000 to US$5,000 per year, according to a  report . 
 Pintek underwrites student loans and splits payments into smaller amounts that can be paid in more frequent installments to make tuition more affordable. According to the company, more than half of its student loans are provided to first-time borrowers with no credit history. It charges an interest fee of  0% to 1.5%  per month, said Pintek’s co-founder Ioann Fainsilber in an interview. 
 The startup offers loans to schools against their anticipated tuition revenue. 
 Founded in 2018, the company said it has reached students in 26 of the nation’s 34 provinces through partnerships with payment processors and schools. 
 In this time of pandemic, the company said it has worked with edtech platforms to provide schools with financing and access to remote learning tools to help them transition to online learning. 
 It is also working with the Indonesian Teachers’ Association to launch a fundraising campaign to help unemployed teachers. According to Pintek, nearly half of the teachers in West Java have lost their jobs due to indefinite school closures. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(3, 0.9996198)]",['Pintek'],"['Indonesia', 'Pintek']"
647296,Grab braces for a ‘long winter’ as Covid-19 drags down revenues," Singapore tech giant  Grab  said its overall revenues have been dragged down by its core ride-hailing segment as the crisis brought by the novel coronavirus continues to force people to stay home.

 Though its food delivery business has seen an uptick amid the pandemic, Grab’s total revenue was “lower than it used to be pre-Covid,” co-founder Hooi Ling Tan was quoted as saying in a  Reuters  report. The exec spoke today at a virtual briefing on the impact of Covid-19 in Asia hosted by the World Economic Forum. 
 The SoftBank-backed company is now planning for “a potentially long winter” as it looks to cut down its spending and become more efficient. She also advised other consumer-facing startups in the region to do the same. 
 Grab’s CEO and founder Anthony Tan last month said that Covid-19, “the single biggest crisis to affect Grab,” has hit the company’s ride-hailing business hard, with volumes in some markets down by  double-digit percentages . 
 Tan also shared that the company was preparing to make “tough decisions and trade-offs” as it continues to gauge the pandemic’s overall impact on its business. 
 Grab has started offering its employees “ flexible working arrangements ” such as no-pay leaves, reduced working hours, and sabbaticals. Grab Singapore head of transport Andrew Chan has also warned that the company might no longer be able to provide drivers with extra financial support if the city-state extends the circuit breaker beyond June 1. 
 “There is a lot of uncertainty as to the depth and duration of the pandemic, and we don’t know how long the economic recession will last. We are taking active steps to conserve cash and manage our employee base,” a Grab spokesperson previously told  Tech in Asia . 
 With strict travel restrictions still in place across the region, Grab is not the only mobility startup facing these problems. 
 Its regional rival Gojek has also seen a drop in activity in its motorcycle taxi service. Its GoRide service has been deactivated in compliance with social distancing measures in Indonesia. 
 Meanwhile, US-based Uber recently said it will be  laying off  about 3,700 of its staff as it sees lower trip volumes in its ride-hailing segment. Careem, Uber’s subsidiary in the Middle East, has also announced plans to cut its workforce by about 31%, affecting 536 employees.

646565,This app wants to make therapy more accessible in virus-hit Southeast Asia," Covid-19 is a global health crisis, and with lockdowns and movement restrictions in place in many countries, it has begun  affecting people’s mental state  as well. 
 Therapy has proven to  help deal  with stress, anxiety, and the other difficult emotions that come with the pandemic, but not everyone has access to it. 
 “A majority of people, regardless of background, have some form of personal struggle, [but they don’t] have an accessible avenue to turn to,” says Theodoric Chew, the co-founder and CEO of  Intellect .

 In many parts of Asia, the biggest barriers to seeking psychological help include high costs and the stigma of getting treatment, Chew observes. 
 He estimates that face-to-face therapy can cost between S$120 and S$250 per session on average in Singapore and typically more than US$80 per session on telepsychiatry platforms. 
 To make therapy more accessible, scalable, and affordable, Chew built Intellect, a Singapore-based healthtech startup focused on providing digital therapy without human intervention. 
 Developed by a team of psychologists and behavioral experts, the app simulates in-person therapy in a digitally guided, self-serve, and session-based approach, also known as computerized cognitive behavioral therapy. 
 With the method, a user will first take a psychometric test, then get a personalized training plan based on the results. The digital therapy program will last for four to six weeks, with learning paths delivered in a series of sessions. 
 The app, which was launched last month on both the Google Play Store and App Store, is designed not just for people who are clinically distressed but also for those who want to work on improving themselves.

 “There is a common misconception that therapy is meant only for those who are in dire need of professional medical help,” Chew says. But Intellect also tackles issues related to relationships, work habits, and personal behaviors, including chronic procrastination, low self-esteem, or difficulty speaking with authoritative figures, among others. 
 The platform works with companies that look to offer wellness or mental health benefits to their employees as well. Chew says the startup has currently partnered with over 10 companies, including tech startups and multinational corporations. 
 The CEO declined to disclose the exact price for Intellect’s service, saying most of its corporate customers have customized packages. 
  Coping with Covid-19  
 As people stay at home to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, they are encouraged to talk to someone to help manage negative emotions. 
 In the past two months, Intellect has seen a surge in demand both from consumers and companies, with thousands of new sign-ups per week. Chew declined to disclose the exact figures. 
 The app normally charges its users on a monthly subscription basis, but the CEO says the service is currently free, as Intellect hopes to help those who might be in distress due to the pandemic. 
 While the company’s approach to therapy is mainly digital, Chew emphasizes that the app does not intend to replace face-to-face therapy just yet. He says that the platform also uses zero-knowledge encryption, which means that no one, including Intellect, would be able to access users’ data.

 The industry’s numbers look encouraging. By the end of 2020, the global digital health market is expected to reach  US$206 billion , with the mobile and wireless segment in Asia Pacific projected to contribute the most significant portion. 
 In Southeast Asia, Intellect competes against firms like Malaysia-based  Naluri , a 500 Startups-backed business-to-business digital mental health platform which secured  US$1.1 million  in a pre-series A round last month. 
 Another player is Sequoia Capital-backed  DancingMind , a Singapore-based startup that uses virtual reality to provide therapy for patients suffering from dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and stroke. It raised US$1.5 million in seed funding last year. 
 To date, Intellect has received a grant from government agency Enterprise Singapore. It has also raised an undisclosed amount of angel funding in its pre-seed round. 
 For now, the startup looks to focus on growing in Asia in the mid term and to help develop the digital wellness space in the region. “As much as the pandemic allows, we definitely plan to raise our next round to accelerate the momentum and the product we’ve built,” says Chew.

 The data protection market across the world has reached US$120 billion, according to Jungle Ventures founding partner Amit Anand. 
 With more enterprises seeking to move their services to the cloud, Dathena, which was founded in 2016, uses AI to identify, classify, and control sensitive data, reduce risks, and enhance the data protection framework. It claims to deliver up to 99% accuracy in data classification and an 80% reduction in information security operational costs. 
 With more than 100 employees, the company is currently present in Singapore, Geneva, and Paris. It recently opened its US headquarters in New York City. 
 Dathena said the latest investment will help the company expand globally. It looks to bolster its research and development efforts and make hires in sales, marketing, and customer success functions in the US. 
 It also plans to expand its co-sell partnership with Microsoft into the US, helping Azure Cloud and Microsoft 365 customers to automate data protection and comply with new data privacy regulations.

647238,A new point-of-sales race is brewing in Indonesia," Despite the growing popularity of online transactions in ecommerce platforms like Tokopedia and Bukalapak, around 96% of total transactions in Indonesia still happen offline. 
 To handle offline transactions, large companies may use a cash register software that has to be installed on-site. Meanwhile, most of the country’s small and medium-sized enterprises still rely on traditional pen-and-paper methods to record transactions. 
 This led to the rise of mobile point-of-sales (PoS) startups like  Moka  and  Pawoon  about five years ago. Using just a smartphone or tablet app, merchants can record transactions, accept online payments, manage inventories, run analytics, and produce reports. Users pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee for this service. 
 However, these pioneers are facing new challenges: Startups that develop their own PoS systems and offer them to their respective ecosystems. 
 
  A sample PoS software / Photo credit: Moka 
 
 Jakarta-based unicorn Tokopedia, for example, has built its own PoS software and is offering it to some of its sellers. With this product, the company can get data from the online transactions taking place on its platform as well as from the offline transactions of those sellers. However, Covid-19 forced Tokopedia to put the development of the product on hold, opting to focus on its core ecommerce business instead, a spokesperson told  Tech in Asia . 
  Payfazz , an agent-based payment company, has developed two PoS systems. One is a feature that was added to its agents’ app and the other is called Post, which is aimed at offline merchants. 
  Warung Pintar , a startup that wants to transform mom and pop stores across the country into smart kiosks, used to provide stall owners with Moka’s PoS software. However, it soon realized that the product didn’t suit   warung   owners, who are generally not tech savvy. 
 Moka’s PoS “was too sophisticated, so we decided to build a simpler PoS by ourselves,” says Agung Bezharie, chief executive of Warung Pintar. 
 Since these newcomers can offer their products at lower prices or even for free because they have other revenue streams, pure-play PoS companies may face tougher days ahead. Covid-19 is also a cause for concern, given how majority of their clients are in the retail sector and the food and beverage industry, which have been hit hard by the pandemic. 
 Only a catalyst 
 PoS software is not rocket science, says Michael Liem, CEO of Indonesian PoS startup  Qasir . The platform can be easily copied, and its main function hasn’t really evolved since the era of its offline cash register predecessors, he says. 
 What’s changed with cloud-based PoS systems is their “integration with payment, stock replenishment, and procurement” services, observes Liem. 
 While other PoS systems charge a subscription fee, Qasir’s product is free, with users paying only for extra features. 
 The company also gets additional revenue from helping merchants buy goods and apply for loans. However, the amount is not significant, Liem says. 
 Qasir claims that its software has been installed by 270,000 users, with 30% of these installations being active merchants. “I don’t believe in a pure subscription model for a developing market like Indonesia. Many people can’t afford it or haven’t understood the benefit of such a product,” contends Liem. 
 Instead, he believes that PoS is only a catalyst for other products. US-based payment company  Square  is an example. It offers PoS through a freemium model, but the majority of its revenue comes from processing payments for those merchants. 
 PoS startups in Indonesia also earn revenue from facilitating payments, says Liem, but the gains have been small.

 Subscription-based Moka, which counts retail and F&amp;B merchants as its main customers, is trying to increase its revenue in other ways. The company, which was  recently acquired  by Indonesian super app Gojek, has expanded into lending (Moka Capital) and stock procurement (Moka Fresh). 
 However, the contribution of those two new services are likely small, and a huge chunk of Moka’s revenue still comes from subscription fees, according to a source close to the company.  Tech in Asia  has reached out to Moka for comment, but it hasn’t responded. 
 Moka has also collaborated with online lending players like KoinWorks, Modalku, Taralite, and an equity crowdfunding startup called  Santara  for its lending business. However, Moka has only facilitated around US$2.7 million in loans as of December 2019. 
 A person who understands the industry says that a company can get 1% or less in commissions for facilitating loans the way Moka does.

 Being part of Gojek may revitalize the future of Moka’s services. Its PoS system will be integrated with several Gojek apps: Midtrans, an online payment gateway; GoBiz, which targets offline merchants; and Spots, an offline payment platform and PoS device provider. With this acquisition, Gojek can consolidate and control online transactions on its platform and offline transactions on Moka. 
 Gojek owns another PoS company called NadiPos. The startup is still new and only had around 200 merchants when Gojek acquired it in 2017. In comparison, Moka claims to be currently serving 40,000 merchants. 
 Gojek’s archrival Grab also has an app for Indonesia-based merchants called Mitra Grabfood. However, the company has no direct partnership with PoS startups, according to Grab representatives. Instead, it has a close relationship with payment app Ovo, which collaborates with PoS players like Moka and has tapped into hundreds of thousands offline merchants in the country. 
 Like other payment apps, Ovo can record offline transactions, but only if the customer uses its payment platform. It’s different from PoS players that can record any transaction on any payment platform. 
 According to Qasir’s Liem, Gojek’s acquisition of Moka validates his thesis that PoS is a catalyst for fintech businesses like payments processing and lending. 
 “There will be more consolidation in the industry. It’s not necessarily M&amp;A, but it can be in the form of deeper integration between PoS players, payment, lending, and other related players,” he says. 
 Fragmented market 
 Pure PoS startups also have to address how fragmented the Indonesian market is. Businesses may have a similar or general need for PoS, but each industry has unique characteristics. Size may also be a factor as well: Smaller businesses may not be able to afford subscription fees, while the bigger enterprises may prefer a more complex and stable solution. 
 This fragmentation has been a key challenge for players such as Moka. 
 The company lost some merchants because they had closed down while other customers had matured and needed more sophisticated features that it couldn’t provide, according to Aldi Adrian Hartanto, vice president of investments at MDI Ventures, which had invested in Moka. 
 “Pure PoS [startups] can have a good business. However, there will be a limitation of the market that they can serve,” Liem notes. 
 
  Qasir CEO Michael Liem (center) / Photo credit: Qasir 
 
 Qasir focuses on microbusinesses and small enterprises, he says. Almost all Indonesian businesses belong to this category, based on  data from the national government . They have assets lower than 500 million rupiah (US$33,500) and annual sales below 2.5 billion rupiah (US$167,500). 
 “I focus on enterprises in Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities. I can get organic traction because my product is free,” says Liem. 
 Based on their price points, PoS solutions of players like Moka and Pawoon are more suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises, he adds.

 MDI Ventures’ Hartanto admits that pure PoS players may have a limited market in the short run. “They need to expand to other sectors if they want to increase the market pool and keep growing,” he adds. They can also retain clients by linking merchants to a larger ecosystem, so that it won’t be easy for them to switch to other players. 
 New opportunity 
 With the fragmentation of the market, some startups are also offering variations of PoS software to offline merchants. 
  BukuWarung  and  BukuKas  for example, are helping merchants record cash flow rather than transactions like PoS software do. These startups are trying to imitate the success of India-based bookkeeping apps like  Khatabook  and  OkCredit . 
 “In the near future, we will launch payment features. [The goal is to] get commission from every transaction that happens in our platform,” says BukuWarung CEO Abhinay Peddisetty. 
 A significant difference between bookkeeping and PoS apps is the availability of loan reminder features, which is useful for customers who often forget to make payments on time. Qasir also has a similar app called  Miqro .

 Another variation is startups that focus on processing invoices, like  Paper.id . Backed by P2P lender Modalku, Paper.id serves business-to-business (B2B) companies that don’t have on-premise transaction terminals like retail shops or restaurants but collect payment through invoices instead. 
 One advantage of PoS and those alternative apps is their access to merchant transaction data, which is useful for credit scoring or business optimization.

 As Covid-19 continues to spread, offline merchants in Indonesia have been hit. Qasir admits that transactions from its retail clients and F&amp;B merchants have decreased. However, the company’s gross payment value is still increasing due to merchants who sell products across multiple ecommerce marketplaces. 
 “To keep track of their inventory and cash flow, they use Qasir to aggregate transactions from all platforms,” explains Liem. 
 Even as POS players are racing against each other, it seems that their biggest battle is adapting to a new normal brought about by a global crisis that shows no signs of slowing down.

 ABOUT 
 
 Year: 2014 
 Raised: US$65 million 
 Investors: Andreessen Horowitz 
 
 Mixpanel is an advanced analytics platform for web and mobile apps. It helps tech businesses get more robust engagement data, educating their innovation decisions to improve customer experiences. 
 Founded in 2009, the company now works with over 26,000 companies, including Twitter, Uber, Expedia, and Skyscanner. 
 Being a more complex software-as-a-service platform, it’s interesting to see Mixpanel’s series B pitch deck, which is much more straightforward and punchier than one would expect from such a firm. But it got the job done – Mixpanel raised US$65 million in 2014. 
  How is the deck compelling?  
 
 The deck starts off by making an argument against measuring performance through vanity metrics or gut feelings and goes straight to a concise value proposition. 
 It has a very clear and succinct mission statement: “Help the world learn from its data,” followed by details on Mixpanel’s competitive advantage. 
 Tells a story of growth through the company’s history of monthly recurring revenues, its sales and marketing performance to date, and key points from its expansion plans.

 The company plans to use the proceeds to expand its business operations, including investing in technology and research and development, implementing its marketing initiatives, and growing its user base. It also plans to fund working capital needs and potential strategic investments and acquisitions, according to the filing. 
 Founded in 2014, Dada Nexus operates the delivery platform Dada Now. Dada Now’s intra-city delivery service currently covers more than 700 cities and counties in China, while its last-mile delivery service covers more than 2,400 cities and counties, said the company. 
 In 2016, it acquired JD.com’s on-demand retail service JD-Daojia. Within a 12-month period, which ended on March 31 this year, it reached a gross merchandise volume of 15.7 billion yuan (US$2.2 billion), generated from 134.7 million orders by 27.6 million active consumers. 
 The company, however, has yet to achieve profitability. It reported consecutive losses of 1.4 billion yuan (US$197.4 million), 1.9 billion yuan (US$267.8 million), and 1.7 billion yuan (US$235.8 million) in the past three years. It posted a US$39.4 million net loss for a three-month period ending on March 31 this year. 
 In 2018, the company raised US$500 million from JD.com and Walmart in a funding round. Additional backers are DST Global and Sequoia Capital, among others. 
 Dada’s rivals in China include the Hong Kong-listed Meituan Dianping and Alibaba’s Ele.me and Hema Xiansheng.

 Launched in 2016, Intello Labs uses AI and machine learning to automatically grade and analyze the quality of fresh produce. It seeks to increase transparency in the supply chain as well as reduce value risk and food waste. 
 Its mobile app Intello Track uses smartphone cameras to capture images of produce, and then objectively grades them based on color, size, and visual defects. It also offers systems such as Intello Sort, a machine that segregates fresh produce based on quality, and Intello Pack, which monitors their quality before they’re dispatched to customers. 
 Milan Sharma, co-founder and CEO of Intello Labs, said the company will be using the fresh funding to fuel its growth in international markets, specifically in the US and across Asia Pacific. 
 “There has been a significant spike in interest from these markets over the past few months, which was further accelerated by Covid-19, and now we have the firepower to go after these opportunities,” Sharma added. 
 Based out of Gurgaon, India, Intello Labs currently has operations in Singapore, China, and the US. Some of its larger clients include Reliance Fresh, Dole, Ocean Spray, and a number of e-grocery companies in China and Southeast Asia. 
 In April last year, the startup raised  US$2 million  in seed funding from Nexus Venture Partners and Omnivore, which it then used to expand further in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia.

 The company said it plans to channel the new funds across its operations in Singapore and Indonesia and aims to double down on its business operations in strategically burgeoning markets, with a key focus on Indonesia for 2020. 
 It looks to use the funding to invest in product development and bet on big data and AI to refine its platform’s ecommerce customer personalization. 
 “Indonesia’s potential is immense, with its burgeoning tech-savvy demographics. We want to be right in the action and unlock the economic potential in growth by 2025,” said Iuiga chief growth officer Jaslyn Chan. 
 To help achieve this, the company expects to double the headcount in its Indonesia office in the next six months. 
 “In particular, we’re observing a noticeable sensibility within the Indonesian consumer market; consumer preferences are evolving where brand affinity is now pegged towards how one’s personal values align with a brand’s broader values and mission,” the exec added. 
 Launched in 2017, Iuiga puts an emphasis on business transparency by working with original design manufacturers to remove unnecessary middlemen and costs. 
 Since its establishment, the company said it has grown its gross market value by 12x and has launched nine physical stores so far in Singapore, with more outlets to open in the future. 
 Iuiga claims that its online retail traffic has grown 4x larger than its regular brick-and-mortar operations, particularly during the city-state’s circuit breaker period. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.38840315), (2, 0.6113189)]",['Iuiga'],"['Singapore', 'Indonesia', 'Iuiga', 'AI']"
646801,This startup is revolutionizing proptech with security and operation automation," In 2014,  the murder  of a young Chinese engineering major near the University of Southern California (USC) made headlines and alarmed the student population in the state. It was the third such case in the area involving a Chinese student in three years. 
 “It was a huge shock to the Chinese student community,” recalls Xing Zhong, co-founder of security and operation solutions provider Turing Video. At the time, he was studying at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which is just a few miles away from USC. 
 Building “The Terminator” for proptech 
 Xing and his co-founder, Song Cao – a USC alumni – were deeply troubled by the murder. “Cameras captured the footage of the Chinese student being attacked [in real time], but nothing happened,” says Xing. 
 Despite the  millions of dollars that universities spend on expensive cameras  and frequent patrols by campus police, safety on school grounds still can’t be guaranteed. 
 The pair concluded that the problem was that human-based security solutions were not scalable. “There are millions of cameras out there, but you simply can’t have enough money to hire as many security guards as possible to sit behind the screen and check the footage all the time,” Xing points out.

 The co-founders’ vision was to merge computer vision and robotics so that, like human beings, patrolling robots can analyze what they see. Xing likened the initial idea to the titular character from  The Terminator  franchise: a robot with an intelligent mind. 
 Their vision finally became reality in March 2017, when the entrepreneurs received their first round of institutional funding in the Bay Area to begin work on a security and operation automation solution. 
 This sparked the development of Nimbo, an AI-powered security robot for video analytics and autonomous patrol. The robot can recognize over 80 categories of things with the capability to react automatically to events with customized responses. Soon after, the US-based startup launched AI Video Platform, a plug-and-play intelligent video-monitoring tool powered by deep learning software and cloud storage. 
 Finding product-market fit 
 Despite having a good idea, Turing Video’s founders were not sure about product-market fit. For a year, Xing did his research and spoke to many potential customers to figure out which sector the company could best operate in. 
 Finally, Xing and Song decided to target the real estate space, where customers were most willing to pay for their service. Early adopters there were already actively looking for integrative solutions. 
 But what helped Turing Video develop its property tech proposition rapidly was the relentless expectations of its Chinese customers. 
 Xing, who was in charge of driving the firm’s business in China, found that enterprises in the country were the most eager to push for the technology’s development, providing specific product requests and giving feedback on existing features. On the other hand, customers from the US expected a more complete and professional solution off the bat. 
 In early 2018, the company had only started to deploy its initial product in malls in China and collected feedback after several months. Its early pilot projects also took a long time as it worked with large enterprises, who often had longer onboarding processes. 
 By winter, however, customers were seeing Turing Video’s value: security guards could stay in command centers and robots did the patrolling. 
 Turing Video then clinched contracts with customers after successful proofs-of-concept, helping the firm realize a 10x increase in revenue in 2019. All the effort that the company had put in to laid the groundwork the year before finally paid off. 
 Accelerating proptech solutions 
 2019 was a pivotal year for Turing Video, as it took part in China’s first corporate proptech  accelerator . Called UrbanLab (城越), the program lasted for three months and was co-launched by real estate services firms  Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL) , Swire Properties, and Ping An Urban Tech. A friend recommended that Xing and Song participate in the accelerator, so they decided to give it a shot.

 Turing Video was one of the 12 startups selected out of the 300 companies that participated in China. It’s an accomplishment that Xing attributes to the team’s focus on proptech, marquee clients and its unique ability to combine computer vision and robotics. 
 “All our customers are big names in the real estate industry,” claims Xing. One such example is Dalian Wanda, which is recognized as one of the world’s biggest commercial property developers and conglomerates. Turing Video has been deployed in all of the firm’s 300 shopping malls. 
 “This name already says something for us: We are not just tech on a PowerPoint but a realized technology,” says Xing. 
 The accelerator opened up a strategic partnership and proof-of-concept opportunity for Turing Video to test its products with properties under JLL Asia Pacific’s portfolio, saving the startup a lot of precious business development time. The move also enabled Turing Video to dive right into solving security and operation problems in property management. 
 Market issues 
 Turing Video serves both US and Chinese customers, and as with all cross-border businesses, meeting users’ expectations was a challenge. 
 One difficulty it faced was localizing its user interface, as Western and Chinese audiences have very different preferences. But adapting its sales strategies for the Chinese market was the bigger challenge. 
 “One reality we have to face is that in the US, people are willing to pay monthly,” Xing shares. “The subscription business model is widely accepted. For instance, people subscribe to Netflix.” 
 On the other hand, business-to-business startups in China need to remain flexible around payment options. “Chinese enterprises have a budgeting process, where a certain amount of money is assigned to projects, and they can only give that amount away,” he observes. 
 Private enterprises also tend to buy entire systems – both software and hardware – and pay maintenance fees every year, rather than adopt enterprise solutions like Turing Video by subscribing to them. 
 Still, Xing says some Chinese enterprises are changing and are surprisingly willing to try the subscription or software-as-a-service model. 
 Going beyond 
 This year, its flywheel effect begins, thanks to its new contracts. “We can expand our product to over 1,000 commercial real estate properties and triple deployment this year,” he says. 
 Now in charge of the startup’s Asia-Pacific business, Xing is working with partners in Japan, Singapore, and Australia. 
 After gaining a foothold in commercial real estate, Turing Video is setting its sights on the bigger residential real estate market. 
 Ultimately, Xing feels that Turing Video has already made a positive impact on the use of artificial intelligence for proptech. 
 “Many technologies were still premature in the past. For instance, an algorithm that is 50% right will give false alarms all the time, so customers would stop using the solution,” he explains. “But our algorithms can be accurate over 90% of the time, so out of 10 alerts, we are only wrong once.”

646989,Covid-19 casts a spotlight on startups in intellectual property businesses," A crisis is a disruptive event. But while it may be scary, it is also a time when fairy tales are born. 
 Take our current situation: Though we’re trapped inside our homes, our need for social and physical activity has created some unexpected winners. 
 Enter  Animal Crossing . It’s a decades-old Nintendo game franchise, a type of animated social game that has recently taken the world by storm. 
 On the surface, the game seems to be designed for kids with its cutesy animal characters. But adults are the ones going gaga over it because, at a deeper level, the game is a reflection of real-world politics. Take Tom Nook, for instance. The crooked raccoon makes players do the dirty work and then claims all the credit. Sounds familiar?

 Another title that’s benefited from the current climate is  Beat Saber , a virtual reality game that was recently acquired by Facebook. Here, ancient sword fighting meets modern dancing, guided by hurling cubes tagged with directional cues. If your quarantine workout has involved doing burpees to the beat of  Gangnam Style , you don’t know what you’re missing. 
 What does all this have to do with venture capital? Well, VCs care more about the micro rather than the macro, about the winners rather than the losers. In fact, some purist VCs would argue that the only startups worth investing in are those in intellectual property (IP) businesses such as software, gaming, and biotech. 
 This is because the business model of these firms is almost all about fixed cost. To them, unit economics is irrelevant, as there is no physical unit cost to assign to each new customer, and any revenue made after breaking even is almost pure profit. 
 Think about Zoom. When you connect and chat with someone on the video conferencing app, you don’t have to pay a separate service provider, unlike when you use Uber and have to pay the driver. Zoom doesn’t need to pay a landlord every time its users host a meeting, unlike WeWork. As a result, the company is able to generate gross margins of 80%, which is the norm across successful IP-based businesses such as Oracle, Electronic Arts, and Gilead. 
 So why aren’t all VCs investing solely in IP-based companies? 
 The reason is that a majority of startups are incapable of “crossing the chasm” to become must-have products. This idea came from Geoffrey Moore, a Silicon Valley marketing guru who has observed that mass market adoption is the ultimate determinant of a particular technology’s success. 
 While most products are well-received by a specific group of early adopters, very few brands can cross the chasm that separates them from widespread usage. Ironically, to be able to do this, Moore advises companies to focus on selling rather than customer service, because it is the market share leader – and not the one who has created the best product – that becomes the winner.

 While 2003 was known as the year of the SARS pandemic, what people often forget is that it was also the time the “worm pandemic” struck the computer world. That year, the Blaster Worm – a virus that mainly targeted Microsoft platforms – infected PCs worldwide. 
 Suddenly, a few small startups operating in the patch management space, some of which were almost running out of cash, became the metaphorical masks and ventilators of the IT world. Needless to say, some of them became highly successful, as patch management became an essential treatment protocol before the virus was finally addressed in a Windows update. 
 In today’s scenario in Southeast Asia, VCs have been operating more as digital transformation funds, investing to create new tech-enabled businesses that private equity funds would want to put money behind or ones that roaming tech giants may want to acquire. 
 With the shutdown shifting consumption behavior from offline to home-based online channels, will we see more investment into IP-based startups and the emergence of new crouching tigers and hidden dragons?

  AsiaCollect , a Singapore-based credit management startup, wants to seize this opportunity by promoting “ethical debt collection” and improving the financial literacy of consumers in underserved economies in the region. 
 The company just raised US$6 million in a series A funding round led by German development finance institution DEG, Dymon Asia Ventures, SIG Asia, and SCB10X, the venture arm of Siam Commercial Bank. This follows the US$4.5 million it raised from SIG Asia in 2018, Arun Pai, the company’s chief sales and strategy officer, told  Tech in Asia . 
 AsiaCollect is also rebranding as Flow, which is part of the company’s strategy to “redefine effective credit management,” according to a statement. 
 Flow plans to use the new funds to grow its business, which involves expanding into Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The funding will also support the development of AI models, such as predictive analysis of borrowers’ behaviors and speech recognition enhancement. 
 Founded in 2016, Flow uses automated and customer-centric collection strategies. It has a couple of AI-based modules, which include voice-to-text functionality for its quality control division and emotion analysis detection. It is also working on a number of other modules slated for roll-out later this year. 
 The company claims to have served over 2.8 million customers to date. It currently operates in Vietnam, Indonesia, and India. 
 In an  interview , Flow co-founder and CEO Tomasz Borowski said that the company is profitable in Vietnam and plans to achieve the same in Indonesia and India this year. 
 The startup is now looking to secure series B money – a mix of debt and equity – for debt portfolio purchasing. The funding will assist lenders in cleaning up their balance sheet, as Covid-19 could lead to a surge in NPLs, it said.

647104,How the Zalora Mafia helped create Southeast Asia’s startup scene," While the past decade saw the birth of many tech startups in Southeast Asia, it could be considered a different era, especially for ecommerce. Shopping online wasn’t commonplace then, and ecommerce transactions were done via blogs, forums, and social networks. 
 That is until German startup incubator Rocket Internet  set its sights on Asia , launching several ecommerce businesses in quick succession including fashion e-tailer Zalora back in 2012. 
 
  Photo credit: Zalora 
 
 Following in the footsteps of its ex-corporate sibling and current rival  Lazada , Zalora is now a top fashion platform across six Asian markets. And like Lazada and National University of Singapore’s  Overseas College program , Zalora has produced a long line of entrepreneurs and executives in its short history. 
 Move fast, hire fast 
 From the beginning, Rocket’s plan was to replicate its business model in Asia: build and roll out  clones  of their Western ecommerce websites within a relatively short time frame. 
 The incubator went on a hiring spree in 2012, scouting from the same management, consulting, and financial talent pools and asking its employees to recruit former colleagues. For high-ranking prospects, it sweetened the deal by offering “co-founder” job titles. 
 These strategies helped attract droves of talent with similar profiles and work ethics. When Matteo Sutto, Zalora’s former director of marketing, joined the company six months after its launch, Rocket had already hired more than 1,000 employees throughout the region. “They gave you the chance to experience the whole startup movement, but with a pretty nice salary especially for startup standards,” he tells  Tech in Asia . 
 
  Matteo Sutto, CEO of Revou 
 
 Zalora co-founder Arne Jeroschewski estimates that there were 28 local and regional co-founders in the firm’s early stages, and that more than 50% of the teams he previously worked with at McKinsey &amp; Company in Singapore joined Rocket. 
 The first set of co-founder hires consisted of aspiring entrepreneurs with related professional goals and a desire for change. For instance, Jeroschewski was drawn by the appeal of tech companies and the urge to future-proof his career. Sutto wanted to leave Italy and work in fast-growing, emerging markets to prepare himself for his next startup. 
 This created a distinctive environment that had both corporate and startup characteristics. 
 Being a Zalora co-founder “was a low-risk move into the tech and entrepreneurship environment,” Jeroschewski says. “It was essentially a no-brainer for anyone given the opportunity to do so.” 
 Spend money to make money 
 This opportunity also came with a nice salary. Zalora could offer that because, like its other Rocket siblings, it was flush with investor cash, having raised hundreds of millions in US dollars. 
 “Zalora started at series D not because of what we have built at that time… but because of the kind of credibility that Rocket Internet brought to the table,” Jeroschewski observes. “I think it’s an entirely unrealistic setting if you compare [Zalora] to any other startup.” 
 Rocket was also still calling the shots at Zalora, even though the startup had people who held “co-founder” titles. But what these executives really wanted was to fulfill that role for real, without the traditional structure or hierarchy. 
 Jeroschewski left by the end of 2012 while Sutto quit just six months after taking on the job. Magnus Grimeland stayed longer, overseeing Zalora through its  transfer to Global Fashion Group  as COO before exiting in 2017. 
 
  Antler CEO and founder Magnus Grimeland / Photo credit: Antler 
 
 After stints at Singapore Post and DHL, Jeroschewski went on to open his own company, logistics provider  Parcel Perform . Sutto wanted to do more meaningful work, so he established two startups: Tate &amp; Tonic, a personalized clothing service for men, and Indonesia-based educational technology firm  RevoU . Meanwhile, Grimeland got on the founder matching, mentoring, and funding side of the business by setting up incubator  Antler . 
 Their time in fashion ecommerce certainly didn’t go to waste. Working at Zalora taught “a generation of high achievers” how to do operations and online marketing “at the highest level,” Sutto points out. This was crucial especially in the industry’s early days, “when there wasn’t that much know-how in the region.” 
 Not just sunshine and rainbows 
 At Zalora, the three former executives interviewed by  Tech in Asia  saw firsthand the many dos and don’ts of business-building. 
 Jeroschewski says Rocket’s playbook is not a good one to follow if there’s little financial backing or investor confidence. Today’s investors are more careful with their money and prioritize business sustainability as the world grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic. The current ecommerce landscape is also saturated with platforms and sales events. 
 He and Sutto, however, like Rocket’s approach to urgency. In terms of company culture, Sutto was generally fine with Zalora’s, but he made sure to avoid recreating two drawbacks – internal frictions and the failure to share the company’s vision and mission – in his next jobs and his own startup. 
 Working at Zalora also made its co-founders and executives more adaptable in various markets, given that they’ve faced the challenges of building a platform across Southeast Asia, which is an especially challenging region, Grimeland says.

 The decision was made after the board received “evidence that sheds more light on the fabricated transactions,” according to a statement.

 The company’s board has also demanded and subsequently received Qian’s and Liu’s resignations from the board, the statement said. 
 Jinyi Guo, who’s a board director and senior vice president at Luckin, will be the company’s acting CEO. Senior vice president for store operations and customer service Wenbao Cao and vice president for strategic partnerships Gang Wu have been appointed as board directors. 
 The company said it had also placed six other employees who were involved in or had knowledge of the fraudulent transactions on suspension or leave at the onset of the internal probe. 
 Luckin said it has been cooperating with regulatory agencies in both the US and China and will continue to cooperate with the internal investigation. 
 Earlier this year, due diligence specialist Muddy Waters Research cited an anonymous 89-page report claiming that Luckin had fabricated its operational and financial figures, inflating revenues by  US$310.5 million . 
 Around one month later,  US law firms  moved to start investigations into Luckin on behalf of investors. In April, the company announced an internal probe into the fabricated transactions. 
 Founded in 2017, the company claimed to operate 4,507 stores across China as of the end of last year, surpassing Starbucks’ 4,300 outlets in the country. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(1, 0.34723997), (3, 0.6524264)]","['Nasdaq', 'Starbucks']","['Asia', 'US', 'Luckin', 'China']"

 The amount raised was undisclosed, but the company said Humanica has doubled its investment, following its  convertible note bridge financing last year .

 In addition, CXA has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Humanica to integrate the latter’s human capital management platform with CXA’s in Thailand. 
 The collaboration will see a combined digital HR payroll and employee benefits for Humanica’s 3,000 local enterprise customers and 700,000 employees. The two companies will offer corporate wellness and disease management initiatives as part of the partnership. 
 With the latest investment, CXA said it will further customize its platform from a software engineering perspective so it can be white-labeled and used by banks in Asia. 
 Through this customization, employees can have access to a range of health, wealth, and wellness offerings based on their personal data via a mobile app. Employees can then purchase offerings by drawing down existing insurance policies provided by their employers and using funds released into the platform’s ewallet. 
 The latest collaboration agreements are part of CXA’s business strategy expansion, according to a statement. Last year, the company teamed up with ThoughtWorks to re-architect its microservices-based platform and set up a technology hub in Vietnam for software engineering.

 According to a statement, of that total, US$289 million came from its online music services, while its social entertainment services segment contributed US$603 million.

 TME said that during the quarter, it saw its online music-paying user base achieve a 50.4% year over year growth to 42.7 million, or about 6% of its 657 million mobile monthly active users. Its music subscription service also raked in US$170 million in Q1 2020, a 70% growth from last year, with average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) increasing by 13.3% for the period. 
 However, the company’s revenue from social entertainment and other related services only saw a 3.3% growth within the same period. While the paying user base in the segment expanded by 18.5%, the ARPPU decreased by 12.9% year over year due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as general adjustments in its livestreaming service. 
 “While acknowledging [the pandemic’s] impact on our social entertainment services, we have started to see a moderate recovery recently,” said Cussion Pang, CEO of TME. 
 Tony Yip, chief strategy officer at TME, said that growth will start to pick up in the second quarter. Analysts expect the company will report an  8.5% increase  in its second-quarter revenue, according to  Reuters . 
 TME, dubbed as China’s Spotify, operates QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music, and WeSing. Its services cover online music, online karaoke, and music-centric livestreaming. 
 During the pandemic, it launched TME Live, a livestreaming model that integrates offline concerts with an online livestreaming experience. It also incubated a new mobile app called Kugou Changchang to offer online music streaming and singing services. 
 Yip said the company has also made “significant progress” in expanding its long-form audio content offering. TME has made thousands of audiobooks available in its library through strategic partnerships with China Literature and other online literature platforms. It has also started cooperating with drama series and local comic IPs for audio adaptation. In addition, the company has launched a new long-form audio app, Kuwo Changting.

647035,Kopi Kenangan nets $109m in Sequoia-led series B round,"  Kopi Kenangan , an Indonesian tech-enabled beverage retailer, announced that it has raised US$109 million in a series B funding round led by existing investor Sequoia Capital. 
 B Capital, Horizons Ventures, Verlinvest, Kunlun, Sofina, and Alpha JWC Ventures also participated in the round.

 The company plans to use the new funds to strengthen its operations in Indonesia, launch new products, invest in technology, and protect employees amid the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a statement. 
 Eduardo Saverin, co-founder of Facebook, will also be joining Kopi Kenangan’s board of directors. 
 Kopi Kenangan was launched in 2017 to fill a market gap between the high-priced coffee served at international coffee chains and the instant coffee sold at street stalls. 
 The company employs a new retail model that combines online with an offline system: Customers can place their orders through an app, then visit the stores to collect their orders or have them delivered to their doorstep. 
 From being a coffee-centric grab-and-go chain, the company has evolved the business to include other Southeast Asian favorites such as boba or bubble tea, which recently became a top-seller in its stores. 
 It also plans to offer food and beverage products from local merchants and its cloud kitchens. 
 Kopi Kenangan said it is committed to helping local F&amp;B entrepreneurs with technology, investment, and mentorship through the food accelerator program Digitarasa. It has also set up a new training academy to reskill baristas and workers in the F&amp;B sector. 
 The company said it currently operates 324 stores across Indonesia, reaching over a million customers through its mobile app. It expects to have 500 stores by the end of 2020, with new stores expected to open in the post-pandemic period in Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia. 
 Its series B round comes less than six months after it raised  an extended series A round  from Jay-Z’s Arrive, Serena Ventures, basketball player Caris LeVert, and Sweetgreen CEO and co-founder Jonathan Neman, among others. It secured  US$20 million  in a series A round led by Sequoia Capital in July last year.

 Existing investors also participated in the round, according to a statement. The amount raised was undisclosed.

 Dekoruma said it plans to use the fresh funding to invest further in the development of Soma, its proprietary interior design and project management application that connects designers, suppliers, contractors, and customers. 
 The company also revealed that in the wake of Covid-19, it saw a spike in home and living sales, as more people seek to make their living spaces more comfortable while on quarantine. Soma has helped take design and project management between customers and its interior design partners online during this period. 
 “Our investment in digitizing the entire home and living supply chain strengthens our ability to serve customers seamlessly while still providing the much-needed income to our partners during this difficult time,” said Dekoruma CEO and founder Dimas Harry Priawan. 
 Dekoruma noted that its technology stack, combined with its asset-light business model, has helped the company grow efficiently in 2019. It claims to have achieved positive unit economics both for its retail and interior design lines of business, and is gearing up to be EBITDA-positive by early 2021. 
 Looking ahead, the company said it expects the changes brought by the pandemic to open up more opportunities for the home and living industry.

 Castlery, one of Dekoruma’s regional peers, recently launched an  AR-powered app  to allow customers to view true-to-scale products from the safety of their homes. The app was initially scheduled for release in Q3 2020, but the rollout was accelerated in light of the current crisis. 
 Indonesia’s Fabelio also aims to introduce its own ecommerce app this year, with an additional AR feature to come later on. It has likewise been working on a virtual tour feature that will let shoppers visit Fabelio’s 20+ showrooms without having to step outside of their homes.

647013,Thai digital payments startup Digio banks $4m in series B funding," Thai digital payments firm  Digio  announced it has raised US$4 million in a series B round from a number of investors to accelerate its product development. 
 The fundraise saw participation from Thai interbank payments provider PCC, Beacon Venture Capital, and Private Equity Trust for SME Growing Together 2.

 Founded in 2012, the Bangkok-based startup initially focused on developing applications to turn mobile devices into point-of-sale systems. It has since expanded to provide both software and hardware payment solutions such as electronic data capture, soft tokens, and payment gateways. 
 The company recently secured a payment facilitating services license from the Bank of Thailand, allowing it to offer new payment services directly to consumers and small businesses. 
 Digio will use the new funds to accelerate product and services development. The company said that given the current public health crisis, the infrastructure supporting cashless payments now plays a bigger role in enabling online and offline transactions for consumers and businesses. 
 In collaboration with PCC, Digio recently launched FLite, a low-cost POS terminal that allows small and medium-sized businesses to securely accept and process contactless credit card payments. 
 The company has also worked with major Thai financial institutions to launch MeeBill, a product that allows online and offline retail merchants to issue invoices to customers and collect payments via QR codes. 
 “Our mission is to enable secure and frictionless digital payments in Thailand and the greater Southeast Asian region,” said Nopphorn Danchainam, the founder and CEO of Digio. 
 Currently, the company has three offices in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, serving clients from all over the region, including Japan, Malaysia, and Myanmar. 
 In 2017, the startup raised an undisclosed amount of  series A  money. Among the participants in the round was InVent, the VC arm of Singtel-backed Intouch. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(1, 0.5677262), (2, 0.43195617)]","['POS', 'FLite', 'PCC']","['Myanmar', 'Bangkok', 'Malaysia', 'Japan', 'Thailand']"

 James Shanahan has been appointed as CEO of Revolut Singapore. He joined the company in March after serving as chief of staff for financial services firm Railsbank Technologies in Singapore and chief operating officer at Singlife. 
 In his new role, Shanahan will be leading the company’s local growth efforts as well as its expansion into wider Asian markets, according to a statement. 
 Revolut has also appointed Rayson Tan as chief compliance officer, chief risk officer, and head of legal in Singapore. Previously, Tan was managing director in the compliance and regulatory affairs department of Credit Suisse. 
 Pam Chuang, who most recently served as vice president of sales and partnerships at insurance comparison platform GoBear, was also named as Revolut Singapore’s head of growth. 
 Revolut’s operations in the city-state employ 30 people, according to the statement. 
 After securing US$500 million in series D funding earlier this year, the company said it was looking to expand its reach  deeper into Asia . 
 “The goal is to build a global financial network, and Asian countries are critical nodes of that network,” Eddie Lee, Revolut’s Asia-Pacific regional director of operations, previously told  Tech in Asia.   
 The company has opened remittance routes to India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Its suite of financial solutions also includes peer-to-peer money transfers, insurance, as well as savings and budgeting tools. 
 Revolut is not the only fintech major that has its eyes set on the region, however. 
 London-based peer TransferWise has been building several partnerships with local e-wallet operators, including Ant Financial-backed GCash and Dana, Gojek’s GoPay, and Grab partner Ovo. 
 It has also recently  partnered  with China’s Alipay to enable international money transfers to China, which is projected to be one of the top remittance recipient countries in the world.

646847,TIA Monthly Report: Late-stage funding surges despite Covid-19,"     
 ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
 Late-stage funding is continuing its strong showing despite the global pandemic. Tech giants with strong cash reserves view this as the perfect time for dealmaking. In India, for example, Facebook has snapped up a  US$5.7 billion stake  in Reliance Jio. 
 Activity in China has also picked up again, with Didi’s bike-sharing spinoff  snapping up US$1 billion . 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
 The contrast between late-stage and early-stage funding cannot be starker. Seed funding in April 2020 is just 10% of the previous year’s tally. 
 Layoffs have been commonplace among startups, though we’re expecting those at the top of the class to continue thriving. Ventures that can expertly tap into permanent behavioral changes brought about by the pandemic will also do well, though this is much easier said than done. 
 With the pandemic likely to last beyond this year due to the second wave of infections, we expect startup funding to remain slow for an extended period of time.

646949,Razer to set up vending machines for masks in Singapore," With the number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore still rising, access to surgical masks has become paramount. 
 In line with this, gaming lifestyle brand  Razer  has announced that it will be setting up vending machines for surgical masks in the city-state, which people can access using Razer Pay, Razer Fintech’s mobile wallet app.

 The company plans to deploy 20 of these machines before the circuit breaker is expected to be lifted on June 1. They will be placed in JustCo co-working centers, near the central business district, and inside Frasers Property Retail’s malls, which are located near transportation nodes. 
 Razer also plans to make one free surgical mask available to every adult aged 16 and above in Singapore. The allocation will be done via the Razer Pay app, which will issue a QR code coupon to users after a verification process. Verified users can then scan the code on the vending machines to collect their free mask. The app will provide users with the locations of these vending machines as well. 
 The company expects to give out a total of 5 million masks as part of the initiative. 
 Over the next few weeks, Razer said that it will be conducting initial beta testing of the vending machines, along with the Razer Pay integration, as it ramps up vending machine deployment and mask supply. 
 People interested to take part in the testing phase will have to download Razer Pay, verify their account, and wait up to one working day for approval. 
 To ensure a continuous supply of masks, the firm has partnered with local manufacturing company Sunningdale Tech to deploy a fully automated mask production line in Singapore that will be able to produce 5 million masks a month at full capacity. Razer aims to double the production to 10 million masks per month soon. 
 “Masks have inevitably become a scarce necessity during this pandemic as we take precautionary measures to curb the spread of the virus,” said Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. “Now that Razer’s dedicated mask production line is officially opened, we will make it our responsibility as Singaporeans to step up and support the community.” ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.9996807)]",['app'],['Singapore']
646915,Xiaomi and Oppo are betting big on their global fintech ambitions," Xiaomi and  BBK Group’s  Oppo are joining the race to become global fintech powerhouses. For their first gambit, the companies are replicating their China playbook to sell loans in India in an attempt to shore up wafer-thin margins on budget smartphones. 
 If successful, these phonemakers could earn significant revenue by charging commissions and interest on loans. They could also profit from collecting and selling anonymized consumer data to financial institutions, giving them an edge over traditional lenders. Limited sharing of user data after getting their consent is allowed in India as  regulations are drafted  to better manage the information.

 Xiaomi and Oppo have launched apps on the Google Play stores that allow Indian users to borrow money for personal or business purposes and invest in mutual funds.

 The two companies are acting as intermediaries to sell loans of up to 200,000 rupees (US$2,600) for Indian banks such as HDFC and Aditya Birla Group. Financing startups such as  EarlySalary  and  Lendingkart  have also teamed up with Oppo, while  ZestMoney  and  CreditVidya  are working with Xiaomi. 
 Currently, both Xiaomi and Oppo get commissions in line with what traditional brick-and mortar distribution channels charge lenders. These distributors include banks, retailers of consumer goods, and online loan comparison startups.

 Despite multiple requests from  Tech in Asia , Xiaomi declined to comment on its commission structure. But observers and rivals say its fees should be similar to Oppo’s, whose commission rates are in line with industry standards. Annual interest rates on loans disbursed on Xiaomi’s platform range from 16.2% to 36%, according to the Google Play Store. 
 Xiaomi helped disburse US$16.6 million in loans through December 2019, a spokeswoman tells  Tech in Asia . Oppo didn’t give a similar number. 
 The loan book of Indian microfinance institutions stood at about US$28 billion by the end of December,  an industry body said . It didn’t provide a year-earlier figure. 
 The next gold rush 
 India is the world’s  second-largest smartphone market , so its lure as a testbed for expansion outside of China is understandable. 
 Xiaomi and BBK dominate the Indian phones market, where Chinese firms sold more than half of the 158 million smartphones shipped in 2019. Between themselves, the companies have more than 200 million users in India, analysts estimate.

 Xiaomi and Oppo have been constantly  churning out   hardware improvments  at competitive prices. Value-conscious consumers in emerging markets like India have forced firms,  including titans like Apple , to keep prices low and boost sales. 
 The cutthroat competition over pricing, however, is eating away at their margins. This is where fintech can come to the rescue. 
  According to KPMG , a blockbuster October to December quarter helped Indian fintech close 2019 withUS$3.76 billion in funds raised – a new record. 
Digital lending itself is expected to grow exponentially. The market in India is expected to hit US$350 billion in loan disbursements by 2023 from US$110 billion in 2019,  says  the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). 
   
 If Xiaomi and Oppo get just a 5% market share – a conservative estimate – of India’s estimated online lending market in 2023, they could gain a fee-based income of US$350 million at an average commission rate of 2%, according to  Tech in Asia’s  analysis. However, this calculation only counts revenue from loan commissions and not the sale of consumer data to financial institutions. It also doesn’t take into account potential revenue from a standalone lending business. 
 
  *All figures in US$ millions; market size estimates from Boston Consulting Group. Assumes market share at an average of 5% and commissions at an average of 2%. 
 
 The potential income would come at relatively lower costs in terms of customer acquisition. 
 “Our strength is the large user base we have. We have 100 million users that we can reach out at no cost,” Vikram Singh, head of Xiaomi’s financial services in India tells  Tech in Asia . “ This gives Xiaomi a leg up on traditional offline distributors of financial services, he adds.

 BCG estimates that 98% of loan seekers in India used a smartphone to research about financing deals.

 Borrowers in India have to undergo a tedious application process, with lenders often seeking different sets of documents to prove identity and residence. They also ask for proof of income such as tax returns and salary slips. 
 But recent regulatory changes have made navigating the lending system less laborious. Lenders can now pull data from credit scoring bureaus. They can also verify someone’s identity within minutes using a  nationwide technology platform .

 Lessons from China 
 China is leagues ahead of any other country when it comes to fintech. The country is home to four of the world’s top 10 fintech firms,  according  to an October 2018 report by H2 Ventures and KPMG. 
 And despite a recent cooling off in funding, investments in China’s fintech industry dwarf others in the Asia-Pacific region. 
 
  Source: Accenture 
 
 Xiaomi and Oppo are counting on applying lessons they learned at home in India. 
 In March 2015, Xiaomi began public beta testing of its financial services in China, and users of its digital wallet began earning interest on their savings in the platform. 
 Since then, revenue has steadily increased. For the three-month period ending in September 2019, revenue from Xiaomi’s fintech unit grew by 91.2% from a year earlier to 1 billion yuan (nearly US$141 million). Overall revenue grew 5.5% on-year to 53.7 billion yuan (US$7.6 billion). 
 Numbers for Oppo or BBK aren’t available as they are privately held. Both declined to share numbers with  Tech in Asia.  
 Growing pains 
 Xiaomi’s fintech journey hasn’t been without its fair share of hiccups. 
 Its ambitions in consumer finance have faced significant setbacks in China due to a tightening regulatory environment and a recent  slowdown  in fintech investment in the country. But in January, Xiaomi finally obtained a consumer finance license, saying that the move would help it gain a stronger foothold in its home market. 
 Prior to that, though, Xiaomi got entangled in China’s peer-to-peer crisis in July 2018. Over a third of China’s P2P platforms  ran into difficulties  because of disputes, halted operations, frozen withdrawals, or executives who absconded with investor funds. 
 Hundreds  complained  about risky third-party P2P platforms being promoted on Xiaomi’s ecosystem. Xiaomi responded by  removing  all related ads and banning new P2P products in its app store. 
 According to local media, Xiaomi ramped up marketing efforts for its own P2P platforms in July 2017 – the same year when founder Lei Jun announced the firm’s commitment to fintech. 
 Last March, Zhuhai Mi Credit, Xiaomi’s microfinance company in Zhuhai, a city in Guangdong province, had its business license rescinded amid a nationwide crackdown on online lending. 
 These setbacks have given the company invaluable insights into know-your-customer regulations and money collection that could come in handy in India, says Xiaomi’s Singh. 
 It doesn’t come as a surprise then that Chinese firms are also eyeing Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines as promising markets for fintech, analysts say.  
 The market landscape mimics that of China to a large extent 
 
India has the world’s second-largest unbanked population after China, says Prateek Roongta, a partner at BCG in India. “The market landscape mimics that of China to a large extent,” presenting a “massive opportunity” amid the Covid-19 crisis, which has boosted digital lending, he adds.
 Chinese tech companies like Oppo and Xiaomi also have access to data from millions of users, giving them a better understanding of consumers compared to traditional intermediaries, says Varun Mittal, global emerging markets fintech leader at Ernst &amp; Young. “If people have a daily consumer touchpoint and data, then they can leverage that,” he adds.

 Data of potential borrowers is shared with financial institutions only after their consent is secured, and the data usage of partners is strictly enforced, say Xiaomi and Oppo executives. 
 User data has assumed more significance as Xiaomi faces increased scrutiny. A Forbes  report said  that the company was furtively recording customers’ web and phone activities, including browser usage in private or incognito mode. Xiaomi later  released a software update  to allow users to disable data collection in private mode. 
 Covid-19 and its impact on the economy has also become a concern. 
 Oppo launched its consumer fintech in India just a few days before the country went into a lockdown. Despite that, some 150,000 users have used at least one of its services, Zafar Imam, head of its financial services business tells  Tech in Asia.  
 But most of the 753 reviewers of the company’s app on Google Play Store said they used Oppo’s free service to generate credit score reports and not apply for loans. 
 Xiaomi was also in a similar situation, with most reviewers reporting that they had trouble using the app to borrow money. It would either fail to respond or there would be no feedback from Xiaomi about their applications, they claimed. 
 Covid-19 has hurt loan disbursements due to a shortage in manpower at partners, a spokeswoman tells  Tech in Asia . “We have noticed that the demand for personal loans has gone down,” she said. 
 Just like in China, both Xiaomi and Oppo will eventually seek to lend on their own abroad, say industry observers. Both companies will capitalize on their experience acting as intermediaries in India to help in pricing loans and train internal artificial intelligence algorithms. 
 Banking on distribution 
 Xiaomi and Oppo are banking on their extended retail networks in India to further their fintech ambitions. 
 Xiaomi wants to tap on its exclusive tie-up with 3,000 mom and pop stores across the country to push its financial services and ecommerce play. Earlier this month, the company said it  would connect  customers to its partner retailers.

 Oppo’s physical distribution network will be its strength as it plans to to leverage its 60,000 stores across India, says Imam. It’s targeting to acquire 10 million users in the next five years. 
 But the key to success in India still depends on their ability to collect debts, which was a significant problem in China. As such, Xiaomi and Oppo are at the mercy of the borrower’s ability to pay on time, says EY’s Mittal. 
 “Just because you dance well doesn’t make you a rockstar,” he says.

 Demi Istri Production was founded in 2013 by director Fajar Nugros and producer Susanti Dewi. After the acquisition, the two co-founders will join IDN Media to lead IDN Pictures, according to a statement.

 Established in 2014, IDN Media now operates IDN Times, Popbela.com, Popmama.com, Yummy, GGWP.ID, Duniaku.com, IDN Creative, IDN Event, IDN Creator Network, IDN Research Institute, and IDN Pictures.

 Jakarta-based super app  Gojek  has quietly introduced an online investment product called GoInvestasi,  KrAsia  found on Sunday.

 Gojek is rolling out the new feature in collaboration with Pluang, a fintech firm offering digital gold investments. Last year, Gojek participated in Pluang’s  US$3 million  series A funding round through its investment arm, Go-Ventures. 
 GoInvestasi allows users to buy and sell gold easily with just a few taps, it says  on its marketing site . The investment tool will inform customers about recent updates on gold pricing. GoInvestasi claims to offer gold with “the lowest fees and highest returns.” The product complies with shariah regulations being certified by the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI). 
 “GoInvestasi is currently available in its beta stage for select Gojek consumers in Indonesia,” Gojek’s head of third party platform Sony Radhityo told  KrAsia . “In collaboration with Pluang, a financial technology platform offering digital gold investments, GoInvestasi provides Gojek and GoPay users seamless and affordable access to digital gold investments, aiming to increase financial inclusion and enable growth for all levels of society.” 
 Pluang was founded in 2018 by Claudia Kolonas and Iwan Tjam under the name EmasDigi, starting as a fintech platform specializing in microsavings. It went through a rebranding in June 2019 and changed its name into Pluang – which means opportunity in Indonesian – planning to diversify its products beyond gold. Nevertheless, investment in gold is still Pluang’s main offering for now. Clients can start with as little as 0.01 grams, which is equivalent to roughly US$0.57. 
 Although GoPay is currently the sole payment method to buy gold on GoInvestasi, it is unclear whether the new product will be a part of GoPay’s offerings in the future. Digital investment was the second most popular fintech category after digital wallets in Indonesia last year, according to  Daily Social ’s Indonesian Fintech Report 2019 .   
 Gojek’s preference for gold differs from local competitors Ovo and LinkAja, both choosing mutual funds as their first investment products. Still, gold is one of the oldest and most popular investments in Indonesia, as it’s considered as a low-risk bet. The public’s interest in buying gold online has been increasing in recent years and many digital platforms entered this segment, including major ecommerce players like Tokopedia and Bukalapak, which launched gold investment products in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
  This report was first published on   KrAsia  .  
  Update (May 14, 1:30 pm): This article was updated to include Gojek’s responses to KrAsia’s request for comments.

 We know from history that a calamity is often followed by a revival – new life, new ways of thinking, and a new status quo. We’re seeing this play out today. 
 Our top story last week was a deep dive into the  sudden demise of Stoqo , an Indonesian online marketplace for food supplies, written by our Indonesia correspondent Putra Muskita.

 But covering layoffs is tricky, as we’re dealing with the raw emotions of the people doing the staff cuts, as well as those who’ve been retrenched. Regardless, we think we’ve approached such coverage in a balanced way. 
 Here’s what a VC who invested in Stoqo had to say about us: “I applaud  Tech in Asia  for taking a measured approach. I have no problem with the press doing fair reporting on all that’s relevant in the ecosystem. As much as they cast a spotlight on the wins, it is also fair that they keep all of us honest when things don’t work out.” 
 If you’re concerned about how your company will be portrayed by journalists, here’s my advice: Don’t shy away from them. Engage. Take control. Share your perspective. Work with the reporter to tell a nuanced story. 
 Looking on the bright side, online shopping has continued to thrive as people are locked inside their homes. Our journalist, Aditya Hadi Pratama, covered a new wave of startups that could  unleash ecommerce’s true potential in Indonesia . It’s a detailed read that goes into the nitty-gritty of executing such a business model on the ground. 
 In the coming months, we’ll continue to parse how a new world order is taking shape. Do  subscribe  to us to keep track of our coverage and read the rest of our recent premium content:

646781,SME lending platform Validus banks over $14m in ongoing series B+ round,"  Validus , a Singapore-based financing platform for small and medium-sized enterprises, today announced that it has raised over US$14 million in its ongoing series B+ funding round. It has secured a total of US$20 million in committed capital for the round. 
 Vertex Growth Fund and Kuok Group’s Orion Fund, which is managed by K3 Venture Partners, co-led the latest fundraising.

 Existing investors such as Dutch bank FMO, Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India, Openspace Ventures, Vietnam’s VinaCapital Ventures, and AddVentures, the VC arm of Thai conglomerate Siam Cement Group, also participated in the round. 
 With the new funding, the company will continue to invest in technology and innovation to solidify its position in the three countries it’s present in. It will also fund an upcoming venture in Thailand that’s slated for the fourth quarter of this year, according to a statement. 
 Founded in 2015, Validus brings together high-net-worth individuals and institutional lenders to provide financing to SMEs. It uses data analytics, AI, and machine learning to assess credit risk. 
 The company launched its operations in Indonesia with Batumbu and in Vietnam with Validus Vietnam after it had secured  US$15.2 million  in series B funding led by FMO last year. 
 Since its inception, Validus said it has facilitated over S$450 million (US$319 million) in loans. It has also topped US$315 million in business funding since it obtained a capital markets services license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore in late 2017. 
 Validus claims over 300,000 Singaporeans have benefited from using its platform, with SMEs seeing a 17% increase in annual revenue in 2018 and a 12% growth in employment.

646870,Australian startup bags $21.4m in series A money to digitize home lending," Australian fintech startup  Verteva  said it has raised A$33 million (US$21.4 million) in series A funding from investment services firm Bolton Equities.

 Founded last year, the Sydney-based startup aims to build a data-driven digital alternative for customers in the home lending space. The company, which has been in stealth mode up until now, looks to use the new funds for market entry, product development, and business expansion. 
 “With the vast majority of mortgages originating in face-to-face meetings, using paper-based forms and manual credit assessment processes, the home loan industry is badly outdated,” said Verteva CEO and founder Andrew Walker. 
 “Changes in the current distribution model are likely to accelerate to be more digitally based, aligning with those of the US and European markets,” he added. 
 The company plans to streamline the processes by moving it online, using data-driven decision-making and recent advancements in tech to create a frictionless customer experience. 
 Bolton Equities CEO Chris Dinnen said that the strength and experience of Verteva’s leadership team set them apart from other companies looking to disrupt the lending industry. 
 Walker leads Verteva with founding chief experience officer Chris Lumby. The duo previously worked together in executive roles for an Australian bank and financial services provider Westpac. 
 Headquartered in Auckland, Bolton Equities invests in several private companies and charities in New Zealand, Australia, the UK, and the US. Its portfolio includes companies operating in the fintech, tech-enabled services, healthcare, and entertainment sectors.

646885,Vietnam-based job recruitment firm JobHopin closes series A round," Recruitment platform  JobHopin  announced it has closed its series A round, bringing the Vietnam-based startup’s total capital raised to over US$3 million. 
 Investors in the startup include SEMA Translink, KK Fund, Mynavi Corporation, Edulab Capital Partners, NKC Asia, and Canaan Capital, according to a statement. Local angel investors, including the CEO of investment bank HSC and the CEO of Forbes Vietnam, have also backed the company.

 Founded in 2017, JobHopin uses AI and machine learning to connect applicants to small and large enterprises hiring in Vietnam. 
 According to the statement, recruitment is a function that affects more than 570 million workers in the region, yet the process has remained substantially unchanged over the years. JobHopin also said that there are about 108 million job placements a year in Southeast Asia, but a number of positions take more than a month to be filled on average, as most prescreening work are done manually. 
 Bunny, the company’s matching platform, standardizes the language used on resumes, job descriptions, and candidate preferences to generate better analytics, which will then be used to make connections at scale. 
 In addition, the platform also offers real-time market data analysis such as salary, talent pool, hiring demand, as well as a database of more than 1.4 million unique candidate profiles sourced from online databases and its enterprise clients. 
 The company said that these features can complement and be plugged into e-learning platforms, online testing services, and other job listing portals. 
 “Since the beginning of 2018, the company has accomplished over 300% year-over-year revenue growth and is optimized for profitability for the Vietnam market in early 2021,” said Thomas Hornbeck, JobHoppin’s second angel investor and board member. 
 In November 2018, JobHopin said it has raised  US$710,000  in a seed round from KK Fund and Mynavi Corporation. Around the time, the startup said it has served over 500,000 jobseekers and 2,000 local enterprises. ",Miguel Cordon,1,2,"[(0, 0.9995385)]","['JobHopin', 'HSC', 'AI']","['Asia', 'Vietnam']"
646856,Vietnamese fitness startup WeFit files for bankruptcy,"  WeWow , a Vietnamese lifestyle platform that offers a ClassPass-like service called WeFit, has filed for bankruptcy as it runs out of cash amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

 In an announcement to its customers, a copy of which was published by  local media , WeWow said it will be closing down all of its services, including WeFit, WeFit Point, WeFit Pago, and WeJoy. “Our working capital is completely depleted. Therefore, we are unable to maintain our business and products,” the company said in its statement. 
 WeWow noted that it would accommodate customers who had bookings until May 10 by working with a third party. 
 WeFit is an app that allows its users to subscribe to fitness and beauty packages in over 1,000 locations in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. It’s similar to US-based ClassPass, which announced last month that it was laying off or furloughing more than 50% of its staff, saying that the pandemic had affected about 95% of its revenue. 
 WeFit most recently raised funding in January last year, securing  US$1 million  in a pre-series A round from CyberAgent Capital and other VC firms in the region. At the time, WeFit said it handled around 150,000 bookings per month. 
 Toward the end of 2019 up to the start of 2020, however, WeFit was sued by a number of gyms and spas due to a policy change that reduced the number of sessions per subscription. It was also reported earlier this year that the startup was piling up debt. 
 In February, WeFit founder and CEO Nguyen Khoi stepped down from his role and was replaced by deputy CEO Nguyen Hai Dang. 
 WeFit is the latest startup in the region that had failed to survive the fallout due to Covid-19. 
 Last week, Indonesian budget hotel firm Airy said it would permanently  cease operations  by the end of the month. Food logistics startup Stoqo has also recently announced its  shutdown .

646835,Supply chain startup Klikdaily closes series A round led by Global Founders,"  Klikdaily , an Indonesian supply chain startup, announced that it has raised an undisclosed amount of series A funding in a round led by Global Founders Capital. 
 The investment follows Klikdaily’s pre-series A raise last year, which also came from Global Founders, Pegasus Tech Ventures, FundedHere, and Teja Ventures.

 Since 2018, Klikdaily focused its business to business-to-business model, positioning itself as a one-stop solution provider for traditional mom and pop stores in Indonesia. With its integrated supply chain management system, retailers can get various products from different brands at competitive prices. 
 The company will use the new funds to invest further in technology. It plans to provide more data-driven insights and systems to help stakeholders – especially principles and merchants – improve their businesses in the fast-moving consumer goods space. 
 It also looks to open more distribution centers to widen its member coverage across major cities in Indonesia by the end of this year. 
 Klikdaily currently operates in Greater Jakarta, West Java, and Central Java, serving “more than tens of thousands” of active mom and pop stores in 600 districts, according to a statement. It claims it has seen more than 700% of growth last year. 
 Klikdaily said it continues to observe an increase in the number of transactions for food and beverage products, as well as some staple food items, during the Covid-19 pandemic. Compared with other industries, its main market has received a relatively “low impact.” 
 “This is the right time for us, as the crisis provides an extraordinary moral impetus [for] Klikdaily to work harder to help the community, and work together with all elements, including the government, to ensure [that] daily needs are available at this time to the community,” said Amos Gunawan, founder and CEO of Klikdaily.

646787,Australian proptech firm Archistar scores $3.9m in series A money," Infrastructure spending in Australia has been increasing significantly as the country sees strong growth in residential and commercial developments. According to a Research and Markets report, the country’s construction industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8.6% to reach  A$194.2 billion  (US$127 million) by 2024. 
 To help companies get a bigger slice of the pie, Australian proptech firm  Archistar  has developed an AI-powered platform that allows property professionals to find available development sites and assess designs. 
 The company said it has just closed its A$6 million (US$3.9 million) series A funding round that was led by local VC firm AirTree, an investor that has also backed design unicorn Canva. AirTree’s co-founder and partner Craig Blair will be joining Archistar’s board, according to a statement.

 Launched in 2018, Archistar’s platform allows architects, planners, developers, and agents to click on any block of land and instantly see what can be built, taking local planning and zoning rules into account. Users can also explore design factors such as light and ventilation. 
 In addition, the startup operates an e-learning platform that helps students develop technical knowledge on generative design software. 
 With the new funds, Archistar looks to set up shop in the US and the UK, where it plans to look for local partners to speed up customer growth. 
 “Property professionals and governments are rapidly embracing digital tools to enable efficient and informed development,” said Archistar CEO Ben Coorey, adding that the company has seen its revenue triple over the last year. 
 Since its launch, Archistar has signed tie-ups with real estate majors such as LJ Hooker, Ray White, and Harcourts, as well as developers and architectural firms like Mirvac, GPT Group, and Aurecon. It has also been working with the governments of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria to integrate its technology into local programs. 
 “Longer term, our vision is to revolutionize the way physical spaces are designed, assessed, and built,” Coorey said. 
 Archistar’s other shareholders include former News Corp Australia CEO Peter Tonagh, former CoreLogic managing director Graham Mirabito, former CBRE Australasia president Tom Southern, and former Murdoch Media managing director Prabhat Sethi, who is now chairman at Archistar.

 M17 said it plans to use the new funds to support its growth strategy in Japan as well as its expansion into the US and other new key markets, such as the Middle East. “This new funding allows us to continue our mission of empowering artists around the world through our online livestreaming and social commerce platforms,” said M17 CEO Joseph Phua. 
 The company looks to capitalize on the increasing demand for a financially viable social platform for artists, as consumer preferences shift towards individualized on-demand viewing online. 
 In addition, the Covid-19 crisis has also boosted user demand for online content, with young artists seeking alternative income sources. During the past few months, M17 said it has seen record high artist and user onboarding, as well as increased user interaction. 
 Its lineup of live interactive platforms includes its flagship app 17Live (called Livit in English markets), livestreaming shopping platforms HandsUP and FBBuy, and Meme Live, an Asia Pacific-focused livestreaming platform that the company  acquired  late last year. 
 M17 previously intended to go public in the US two years ago. It was originally targeting  US$115 million  for its initial public offering, but dropped the amount to US$60.1 million during its roadshow. It then  cancelled  its listing on the day shares were supposed to begin trading.

 Cox will be responsible for helping Carousell attract more users and generate leads for merchants, including dealers, agents, and advertisers. She will also be in charge of the regional marketing strategy for the company’s general classifieds marketplace, as well as its verticals such as autos and property. 
 She will be overseeing all marketing functions at Carousell across the region, from digital marketing to brand and communications, and will be reporting to co-founder and CEO Siu Rui Quek. 
 Cox has had 12 years of experience in customer proposition and growth strategy. Before joining Carousell, she was the senior vice president for regional supermarket at Redmart, the online supermarket arm of Lazada. She was also in charge of growth at UK-based online grocer Ocado. 
 “As a general marketplace, there are distinct tracks for user journeys on Carousell – buying a secondhand mobile phone is very different from looking for a new place to live,” said Cox. “With my category-based expertise, I will help us focus on these diverse customer journeys to understand how we can best cater to our users’ needs.” 
 Founded in 2012, Carousell is a classifieds marketplace for buying and selling new and secondhand goods across categories such as cars, lifestyle, gadgets, and fashion accessories. 
 It currently operates in eight markets in Southeast Asia. It’s backed by Telenor Group, Rakuten Ventures, Sequoia India, and Naspers. ",Doris Yu,3,2,"[(3, 0.9995945)]","['Carousell', 'Naspers', 'Redmart', 'Ocado']","['Lazada', 'UK']"

 Spun out of Singapore’s Center for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore, Entropica Labs develops software tools, methods, and models to lay the groundwork for bringing quantum computing into the mainstream. It currently focuses on quantum optimization and machine learning technology to help enterprise customers better understand and implement quantum computing. 
 The startup said it plans to use the new funds primarily to expand its technical team and further develop its proprietary software architectures. 
 Right now, Entropica’s software roadmap is centered around its Entropy Development Framework, which allows both developers and users to work together on building quantum computing workflows. 
 To help with development and testing, Entropica has been working with global quantum hardware majors such as IBM, Microsoft, and Rigetti Computing to get early access to quantum computing resources and platforms. 
 “We are rapidly progressing towards a world in which quantum computing is a reality,” said Wavemaker Partner managing partner Paul Santos. “We recognize the enormous potential of developing software tools that will enable users, for example, to unleash the power of machine learning using quantum computing.” 
  See also:  A new wave of quantum tech startups from Singapore hopes to make a mark   
 Entropica was founded by Tommaso Demarie and Ewan Munro, both Center for Quantum Technologies alumni, in May 2018. They were later joined in December 2018 by Joaquin Keller, who previously served as the head of a distributed computing research group at telecom firm Orange in France.

646687,How ASEAN’s digital economy can stay strong even as Covid-19 wreaks havoc," Renowned value investors like Baron Rothschild would say that the best times to buy are when markets are facing a great deal of uncertainty. 
 To be fair, though, the contrarian 18th century investor wasn’t dealing with anything like what we are seeing now: A global pandemic that has simultaneously caused a widespread loss of human life and a global economic drain. 
 
  The flags of Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) members in the ASEAN headquarters at Jalan Sisingamangaraja No.70A, South Jakarta, Indonesia. 
 
 But if you believe that the international race to develop a Covid-19 vaccine will be successful over the next 12 to 18 months, then you may also believe that the global economy can rebound relatively quickly. However, the surviving businesses, particularly in the tech industry, will look very different compared to the ones we had known before the pandemic. 
 Interestingly, the International Monetary Fund says that only emerging Asian economies will see positive GDP growth in 2020 (albeit by a mere 1%). Most other places in the world will not be so lucky. From a tech investor’s standpoint, this implies something interesting about the population and consumer behavior in the collective ASEAN market. 
 So despite all the chaos and fear, here’s why I think now is a wonderful time to be making tech investments in the region. 
 Millennials to help the economy bounce back 
 Once a slowly developing region, ASEAN is fast becoming a sweet spot for investors and businesses globally – and for good reason. Home to over  660 million people  (approximately 8.5% of the world’s population), it boasts a US$6.5 trillion economy that’s fueled by rapid population growth, increasingly tech-savvy consumers, and a budding digital economy. 
 Currently, the ASEAN population is  young, literate, and urbanized , with roughly half of the region living in urban areas and with a median age of 30.2 years old. 
 Contrast this with those in Western European countries that have been hit hard by the pandemic: Spain, Italy, France, and the UK. Not only do they rank in the top 25 countries with the largest percentage of  adults over 65 , but they also clocked in among the top 10  most visited countries  in 2019. 
 With Covid-19 threatening a large chunk of their populations and actually wiping out a key economic sector (tourism), it will be inevitably harder for these European countries to bounce back, in comparison to ASEAN nations that have high domestic demands and young workforces to fall back on. 
 Lessons old and new 
 The pandemic and the resulting movement restrictions imposed by most countries have brought old lessons into focus, as cash flow became every entrepreneur’s single most important metric seemingly overnight. This was something that industry stakeholders had touted in the occasional think piece in 2019, but now, it’s become a tenet for every founder. 
 Many agile entrepreneurs and businesses are actually embracing the paradigm shift. As consumers turn to the internet while stuck at home, startups that are able to are pivoting and repurposing key aspects of their businesses, and in some extreme cases, are even undergoing complete and rapid change. 
 In Indonesia, movement restrictions have already affected 34 million people in the Greater Jakarta area, and it is looking very likely in the coming weeks that more provinces and municipal authorities will activate their own lockdowns. 
 These restrictions further emphasize the importance of public necessities such as healthcare, education, logistics, and agriculture – sectors that savvy VCs and angel investors would do well to support in the post-pandemic era, especially as more rural parts of Indonesia begin shutting down in the weeks that follow. 
 There still remains a large swathe of startups that continue to attempt to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers and are now lifelines for small businesses and farmers in rural provinces. Companies like TaniHub, a business-to-business agriculture marketplace, have instantly become more important to the nation’s digital economy. 
 Meanwhile, healthcare startups have also taken on the role of serving as vital information channels and lifelines for the immunocompromised who are afraid to go to hospitals or pick up prescriptions at pharmacies. 
 Digital firms like Halodoc and Alodokter have quickly gained consumer trust in a time of fake news and WhatsApp hoaxes. These startups are acting as medical information purveyors for all things Covid-19, setting up credible and trustworthy channels for FAQs and government messages. 
 Prioritizing public necessities 
 Investments in these types of companies should not be short-term propositions, however, as social distancing and fully online supply chains are expected to be the new normal for at least a year after the virus subsides. By then, there will be no going back; B2B and business-to-consumer habits and norms will have mutated categorically. 
 Pithy sayings from people like Rothschild and Warren Buffett may be true, especially if you’re the kind of investor who only cares about returns. 
 Our thesis, however, is about being bullish on investing on public necessities, whether there is a crisis or not. The Covid-19 outbreak shouldn’t have changed our capital deployment strategy one bit. 
 Shifts in demographics and consumer behavior have been clear calls for venture capitalists and institutional money to triple down for several years already; in this respect, the pandemic is just a jarring kick in the rear. Tech investors with any kind of liquidity should make more bets on local startups in 2020, not fewer. 
 Recalibrating to stay the course 
 Assuming a Covid-19 vaccine pops up soon – and if 2021 resembles anything like 2019 – ASEAN’s digital economy should grow to over US$300 billion in as little as five years. This is a signal for small- and medium-sized enterprises and companies to look toward tech and the internet to reach a growing demographic. 
 With a younger, digitally fluent population spending more, ASEAN is the perfect petri dish for growth. But as Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc this year, there are a few things that need to happen to keep our digital economy purring. 
 Venture investors that are set to weather the storm need to adopt a higher risk tolerance in general and continue deploying capital into the ecosystem. If needed, they should shift their investment priorities toward companies that can not only survive but even thrive under the new market conditions. 
 Startups, on the other hand, need to prioritize cash flow and ensure that their business models can be financially viable from day one. But that’s not all: Every founder should decide whether they need to make a hard pivot, one that may even change the fundamental fabric of the business.

646694,How this startup is transforming healthcare amidst a crisis," Southeast Asia has seen phenomenal growth in recent years and is projected to be the  fourth-largest economy in the world by 2030 . A lot of this is driven by its digital economy, which has tripled in size over the last four years, becoming a symbol of the region’s development and modernization. 
 And yet despite all this advancement, one vital area remains underdeveloped: healthcare. Medical systems in the region are straining to meet demand on a regular basis, an issue that has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 The answer lies in digital healthcare. “In general, healthcare in the region still relies on physical and manual coordination,” says Kelvin Chen, CEO and co-founder of  Kent Ridge Health , a digital healthcare company that aims to make it easy for people to navigate their healthcare journey. 
 The sector is very traditional and cumbersome, he says, adding that he has seen little improvement in healthcare outcomes.

 Accessibility, fraud, and cost issues 
 In Southeast Asia, it’s  not out of the ordinary  for people to wait for hours just to see a physician, as doctor-patient ratios fall below the global average. Long wait times can also lead to daily wage workers losing a day’s pay – a problem exacerbated by costly medical treatment in the region. 
 A public health crisis like Covid-19 can push healthcare infrastructures further to the breaking point. 
 As such, basic accessibility remains an issue. Matthew Tang, co-founder of Kent Ridge Health, recounted a conversation he had with a doctor from Ho Chi Minh to illustrate this point. “He explained how [patients] have to take overnight buses just to get to the city to see him. If they miss their bus back home, they’ll have to stay the night in the city, which is expensive,” he says. 
 In an effort to save time and money, some turn to options that could cause more harm than good. 
 “In Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, medicine may not be widely available,” says Chen. “Lower-wage earners may end up just picking up a box of unapproved pills from street peddlers instead.” 
 The startup credits these issues to several factors, including the realities of geographical size, varying stages of infrastructure and economic development, and distinct healthcare policies. 
 Additionally, healthcare providers often operate in silos, with individuals and organizations not coordinating with one another. This creates a disjointed system that results in wasted time and higher costs as patients are forced to find their own way through the medical labyrinth. 
 “The solution is in designing technology that is uniquely suited to healthcare problems and creating a human-centered ecosystem that speaks to all stakeholders in healthcare,” says Tang. “Our ecosystem aims to improve overall healthcare outcomes. This outcome driven approach to healthcare is still very nascent today.” 
 Driving better healthcare outcomes 
 Kent Ridge Health aims to fill this gap with its ecosystem and app, Euda. Taking its name from the first four letters of the Greek word eudaimonia, which  roughly translates  to “happiness,” the platform was built to seamlessly deliver a wide range of healthcare services including telemedicine. 
 Patients also get access to a care team that supports them through their journey, from finding the right doctor to navigating payments and post-surgery care. 
 Because it is an ecosystem, Euda allows its members to access, pay for, and manage all their healthcare needs in one place. 
 “We also take a data-driven approach to analyze and offer thoughtful care options to members and their doctors,” explains Chen. “The technology also optimizes employee care for businesses by identifying areas of care that employees need.” 
 This all-encompassing strategy has been effective, improving healthcare for its 500,000-plus members, who can consult with doctors four times faster compared to visits arranged through other means. Healthcare costs across the platform are 40% lower on average, and pre-emptive healthcare pricing promotes transparency and clarity, Chen says. “On the whole, our platform has improved healthcare outcomes for all our patients while lowering cost,” he adds. 
 These successes have yielded business results as well. “We now serve more than 1,000 corporate clients, up from the five when we started in November 2017,” shares Chen. Kent Ridge Health has also built a global partnership network of over 2,000 doctors and medical institutions, which forms the foundation of the company’s services. 
 Looking ahead, the team plans to constantly develop Euda, automating more functions to reduce costs even more. “We are developing technologies, such as image recognition, predictive algorithms to read MRIs and X-rays,” lists Chen.

 Supporting the community through Covid-19 
 Being built on tech put Kent Ridge Health in a strong position to respond to the needs of people and businesses amid this pandemic. 
 “Before Covid-19, most people thought that teleconsultation was simply about convenience,” Chen says. “Now, it has become an essential part of public health safety.” 
 To encourage better public healthcare, the startup is making its in-app doctor teleconsultations available to members and non-members alike. “At a time like this, we don’t want the costs of seeing a doctor or the fear of going to clinics to be a barrier to someone looking for care,” says Tang. 
 It will also be launching  KRTouch , a device with facial recognition and temperature-reading features that automates visitor logging and contact tracing, designed for use in offices and malls. 
 “This is intended to help manage crowds and enable seamless contact tracing,” explains Chen. “At the outset of this crisis, we recognized fairly quickly that a device like this was going to be essential in the future.” 
 Kent Ridge Health believes such technologies will continue to drive better healthcare outcomes while decreasing costs for individuals and businesses. 
 “We see ourselves as changemakers in healthcare,” says Tang, “Not only providing an end-to-end service but improving the lives of individuals.”

 The company plans to use the new funds to accelerate the development of new candidates into clinical trials, as well as strengthen its scientific and research and development capabilities, according to a statement. 
 “These new funds give us further resources to develop our early-stage pipeline and support the clinical development of our lead programs,” said Piers Ingram, CEO and co-founder of Hummingbird Bioscience. 
 Founded in 2015, Hummingbird Bioscience uses systems biology to develop insights into disease biology and applies computationally guided platforms to discover and engineer biotherapeutics. It’s present in Houston, Texas and South San Francisco, California. 
 The company has a pipeline of drug candidates – including HMBD-001, an anti-HER3 antibody, and HMBD-002, an anti-VISTA antibody – for cancer treatment. 
 Earlier this year, the biotech company announced the publication of positive data on HMBD-001 and the manufacturing of HMBD-002. Regulatory submissions to initiate Phase I studies for these two are expected in the second half of 2020, according to the statement.

646739,How Ninja Van is powering cross-border ecommerce beyond deliveries," When Chang Wen Lai founded  Ninja Van  as a last-mile delivery solution for his own menswear brand in 2014, he never imagined he would be helming one of Southeast Asia’s largest logistics startups. “Our plan was to have 20 drivers and call it a day,” the former Barclays trader quips. 
 Today, the express logistics startup has grown far beyond the  5,000 parcels  it was delivering daily in 2015, processing a million packages a day on average across six Southeast Asian markets.

 With its  latest capital injection of US$279 million , Ninja Van is turning its attention to the millions of microentrepreneurs and small businesses in the region. The company is expanding its first and last-mile logistics offering upstream to include overseas procurement, escrow services, and cross-border shipping services while building its business-to-business (B2B) service in Malaysia. 
 Lai declined to disclose the startup’s latest financials but says it has “never failed to more than double its revenue” every year. The company clocked around US$9.5 million in revenue in the six-month period between January and June 2017, regulatory filings show. Assuming an annual growth multiple was 2x at the minimum, the estimated topline was at least US$76 million in 2019. Ninja Van, however, didn’t comment on the projected sum. 
 An untapped opportunity 
 Southeast Asia is seeing a boom in online sellers, many of whom are tapping into various ecommerce marketplaces. Increasingly, however, they’re building their branding on social media and directly selling products to their followers. 
 Lai is keenly watching this social ecommerce trend as Ninja Van currently handles logistics for “hundreds of thousands” of small businesses.

  Ninja Direct , the service which has seen “triple-digit growth” since its launch in Indonesia in the second half of last year, is an area that the startup will heavily invest in, Lai says. It plans to roll out the service in Malaysia next. 
 “What’s interesting is that a lot of small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) are not selling domestically-produced consumer products but imported ones,” he observes. “We want to enable that whole business. Focus on engaging your customers, choosing products that suit your brand, marketing, and the whole consumer experience, but let us take care of everything on the back-end.” 
 As brands wean off their dependence on ecommerce marketplaces such as Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia – all Ninja Van clients – and diversify to other platforms, an end-to-end logistics service provider that can help with sourcing and procurement, warehousing, and transportation, could be an alluring choice for these brands. 
 “The opportunity is with the sellers – the smaller ones in particular, who don’t have the scale to drive economics,” says Kuo-Yi Lim, managing partner at Monk’s Hill Ventures, a returning investor in Ninja Van’s series D round.

 For microentrepreneurs, sourcing and procuring goods from overseas are not without hurdles. Doing so personally is time-consuming, and moving products back to their home countries manually – i.e., via suitcases – is a laborious process that’s hard to scale. 
 Cross-border payments add another layer of complexity, and that’s only the beginning. “After you pay, how do you ensure that the person will ship out your products? After [the seller] agrees to give it to you, who is there to receive it in the country and how are you going to ship it back?” Lai asks. 
 Ninja Van isn’t the only company that’s eyeing this space. Companies that help online sellers such as Temasek-backed fashion company  Zilingo  and Canadian ecommerce platform  Shopify  have sprouted up in recent years. 
 Zilingo has pivoted into a supply chain company of sorts, offering fashion retailers and factories a variety of tools from procurement, inventory management, to financing – a proposition that has drawn  significant investor interest . 
 Meanwhile, Shopify, which helps sellers build and manage their online presence through a webpage, has met with limited success in Southeast Asia, which it entered in 2013. That could be because unlike the US or in Europe, a lot of customer engagement in the region happens on social platforms, Lai notes. 
 For most brand owners in Southeast Asia, the biggest pain point isn’t in customer engagement. Instead, it’s supply chain and logistics. 
 Ninja Direct builds on all of Ninja Van’s strengths: a pan-regional network where it claims to have “100% coverage” and a domestic logistics service. 
 Navigating the region’s fragmented freight forwarding sector involves dealing with multiple service providers – largely analog mom and pop businesses – which pose a challenge for digital natives. Express shipping services can also be costly.

 These factors, however, work in Ninja Van’s favor. 
 By consolidating parcel volumes from the “thousands” of SMEs and smaller merchants selling through direct-to-consumer channels, Ninja Direct negotiates with freight forwarders to get better freight rates for these clients. “There’s no market that exists for a 30 kilogram to 100 kilogram shipment that’s affordable and traceable. You either ship by container or parcel. There isn’t really an in-between,” Lai explains. 
 What’s “gig” about the gig economy? 
 Ninja Van operates a hub-and-spoke logistics network in which products from various locations are consolidated at a central distribution center before being shipped out to their final destinations. That’s unlike players such as  Lalamove  and  GoGoVan , which use a point-to-point model that directly connects buyers and sellers. 
 While both Hong Kong-based companies have aggressively pursued asset-light models by relying on freelance workers to keep costs low, Ninja Van employed a different model from the onset. 
 Most of Ninja Van’s 30,000 employees are delivery staff, and “a fair bit” of them work full-time. It generally does not employ gig economy workers, “We employ someone gainfully for the entire day, [someone for whom] Ninja Van [contributes] a majority of earnings,” he adds. 
 One reason for that is because at current delivery volumes, base load requirements are best served by people who “know they’re well-taken cared of, are experienced at their job, and tech-enabled,” Lai said in  an interview  in February. 
 Lai’s perspective is a departure from the prevalent practice of informal peer-to-peer arrangements, which have propelled the rise of companies like Airbnb and Uber. Neither startup owns their core selling point: real estate listings for short-term rental and cars that provide ride-hailing services in most of its markets, respectively. 
 “If you dig a bit deeper, you realize that [many of] these gig economies are not “gig” – a majority of these workers are full time,” Lai says. “What’s gig about it?” 
 “The biggest fallacy here is that people can be commoditized,” he points out. “If you commoditize them completely, you lose […] what holds people together – the camaraderie and relationships. As long as you’re a company that runs on a lot of humans, you cannot lose that human element,” Lai adds.

 So how does Ninja Van manage its massive workforce? 
 The startup employs a mix of monetary and community-driven incentives that differ from market to market. In Singapore, its delivery driver pool is highly incentive-driven and relatively more efficient – routes are optimized and drivers get a payout for each delivery. 
 “In some other countries, what we focus a lot on is community,” Lai says. “We make drivers accountable to each other. We put pools of incentives for drivers which then are shared as a team. It incentivizes them to solve problems on the ground and [this] drives the performance as a group,” Lai explains. 
 Events such as  “rider nights”  celebrate their achievements alongside the country’s milestones. 
 Customer complaints 
 As Ninja Van grew, it got its fair share of complaints and unhappy customers. 
 The startup’s  Facebook page  is riddled with comments from frustrated customers over the lack of visibility on the status of their packages, late deliveries, and unresponsive customer support, just to name a few. 
 To address such concerns, Ninja Van is focusing on developing more comprehensive customer relationship management systems and introducing automation in that process. Lai is confident that a combination of chatbot and live-agent support as well as WhatsApp and Facebook messaging channels will improve the overall customer experience. 
 “There will always be unhappy customers [and] parcels that fall through the cracks. Our big focus is that [on] all of these issues, you’ll only get unhappy with us once,” Lai says. 
 New business areas 
 From day one, the startup has been focused on serving businesses – and businesses alone. That’s going to remain so. “We help businesses with their consumers, but we’ll never step into the [consumer] space because we respect that the customers are theirs,” Lai stresses. 
 Ninja Van plans to strengthen its B2B service, which it  piloted in Malaysia  last December and is growing at a 50% rate month-on-month. At present, it targets SMEs as well as firms in the financial services and pharmaceutical sectors. 
 While financial institutions are “the biggest users of translational document services,” Lai says there aren’t any solutions aimed at improving the document management supply chain.” He adds that increasing digital penetration in the relatively untapped pharmaceutical space can bring about a “final-mile medicine delivery opportunity.”

 The participation of Zamrud, Brunei’s sovereign wealth fund, in the recent fundraise, has  sparked speculation  about the Ninja Van’s plans in the country. Lai says the startup is currently working on “stabilizing its operations” in Brunei. 
 While Covid-19 has stalled growth in the past two to three months, things are now “picking up significantly again,” Lai says. Delivery volumes have increased 10% to 19% since the start of the pandemic. The startup continues to battle decreased operational efficiency and productivity due to social distancing measures, but Lai is optimistic about its medium-term prospects. 
 While Ninja Van is profitable in three of its markets, Lai did not specify when he expects the entire company to turn fully profitable. That will probably come as Ninja Van achieves greater scale. 
 “Logistics is a scale business: the more scale you have, the more efficient you are, the better margins and the service you can offer. That allows you to capture more value [and] will naturally lead to more margins and more profitability,” says Lim of Monk’s Hill Ventures.

646666,WeChat vs. Alipay: The heated battle between China’s super apps," In China, mobile apps are deeply embedded in people’s everyday lives. You can access a variety of “local services” – shop for groceries, order takeout, get a taxi, settle bills, and book your travels – with just a single app. 
 Leading the market is WeChat, a social platform owned by Chinese gaming giant Tencent. Mobile payment app Alipay, operated by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, is a close contender. 
   
 These so-called super apps have become so ubiquitous in the country that at the peak of the Covid-19 crisis, the government had to rely on them to host health status apps to keep track of all its citizens. 
 The pandemic has led to a surge in demand for local services, and it could be making these super apps even more relevant. Alipay recently decided to up the ante by adding on apps from Alibaba’s ecosystem, such as food-ordering app Ele.me, travel-booking platform Fliggy, and movie-ticketing service Tao Piao Piao. 
 Alipay’s recent move was prompted by the escalating competition with fellow super apps WeChat and Meituan-Dianping. Some believe that it’s also aimed at gaining a tighter grip on data generated by users’ daily consumption, which could fuel Alipay’s financial, ecommerce, and advertising services. 
 Going local 
 In March, Ant Financial announced a  three-year-plan  to further open up Alipay to stores, restaurants, and merchants as well as to bring 40 million service providers in China into its ecosystem through marketing and operational support. 
 Ant Financial’s ambition is to turn its mobile payment app into a “one-stop digital lifestyle platform,” CEO Simon Hu said at this year’s Alipay Partners conference. 
 Alibaba has been eyeing the local services market for some years now, building its ecosystem mostly through mergers and acquisitions. In 2018, the ecommerce titan merged its Ele.me unit with online-to-offline platform Koubei to further consolidate its local services business. 
 Expanding local services and integrating them into the Alipay app makes a wide range of options more accessible to users, an Ant Financial spokesperson told  Tech in Asia . 
 
  Alibaba’s lifestyles services ecosystem. 
 
 While Alipay has attempted several major transitions over the years, moving into the lifestyle segment and local services is proving to be a more successful effort. Covid-19 has given Alipay a good reason to launch this initiative, according to Huang Dazhi, senior analyst from Suning Institute of Finance. 
 Alipay and online shopping platform Taobao are the two main traffic funnels within the Alibaba ecosystem. But compared with Taobao, local services are more compatible with Alipay’s core of mobile payments and financial services, says Huang. 
 For hundreds of millions of consumers in China,  going cashless  to pay for their purchases has become the norm. As such, adding lifestyle services to the Alipay app could create synergies within Alibaba’s ecosystem and drive traffic to its other apps. 
 Giants go head-to-head 
 Alipay’s latest push is largely seen as a bid to take on Tencent-backed Meituan, its main rival in China’s lucrative local services market, which was estimated to have reached nearly 916 billion yuan (US$129 billion) in transaction volume in the first half of 2019, according to a  report  by big data firm Analysys. 
 Alibaba’s Ele.me has long been locked in an intense struggle with Meituan. Many have noted that Alipay’s recently upgraded homepage bears an  uncanny resemblance  to the rival app. 
 Maidan, a new credit payment feature that Meituan launched in January is a direct competitor to Alipay’s Huabei, observes Eliam Huang, an analyst at tech and retail-focused research firm Coresight Research. She adds that Meituan already has a payment feature in its app, and this is a clear indication that it no longer wants to rely on other payment services like Alipay. The bold incursion into Alipay’s turf could have triggered Ant Financial to ramp up its local services efforts this year 
 Food delivery is the major battleground of local services, and Meituan has come out ahead of Alibaba’s Ele.me and other players, holding nearly two-thirds of the fast-growing market. The company posted  strong profits  last year, largely driven by revenue from its food delivery and travel businesses, according to its fourth-quarter earnings report. 
   
 Compared to Alibaba, Meituan’s local services also brought in more than double the revenue, and its merchant network for this business is larger and more active. Furthermore, Meituan recently  expanded  its physical sales offering to include selling smartphones and cosmetics to take on Alibaba and online retail giant JD.com. 
 Alibaba’s ecosystem is broad but fragmented, observes Coresight’s Huang. However, this doesn’t mean that the company is lagging behind in the local services race. Alibaba has long regarded “new retail” – the concept of merging online with offline commerce put forward by founder Jack Ma – as a strategic area, and that includes local services. Apart from food delivery, it zeroed in on ecommerce, logistics, fresh grocery, and mobility. 
   
 When Alibaba decides to pour its resources into an area, it places a huge pressure on all players in the field, Wang Xiaofeng, senior analyst at market research firm Forrester, tells  Tech in Asia . Its stickiness and customer loyalty can also help Alipay beat out other lifestyle or food delivery-focused apps. 
 Alibaba’s interest in local services goes beyond short-term revenue opportunities. “If you followed Alibaba’s past initiatives and M&amp;As, they all [had] the goal of gathering more information on customers,” notes Chiang Jeongwen,  professor emeritus  at China Europe International Business School. 
 He adds: “Intimate insights would empower its ecosystem to serve its clients and consumers better and eventually have more business opportunities. They don’t require all apps to make money. So long as the app generates consumer insights, it is useful to the group.” 
 Covid-19 offered an opportunity to internet heavyweights like Alibaba and Meituan to push further and innovate. “The pandemic forced people to get online more than ever – that means deeper penetration and higher frequencies,” observes Chiang. 
 Super rivals 
 From social networking and food delivery and healthcare services to cloud computing, Alibaba and Tencent are fierce rivals on many fronts. Naturally, the rivalry has trickled down to Alipay and WeChat, respectively. 
 Alipay’s foray into local services brings it one step closer to WeChat’s super app status and allows Alibaba taking another swing at Meituan. 
 Though Alipay and WeChat have taken different routes, they’ve repeatedly crossed into each other’s lanes and made strategic moves that seemed to mimic each other at times. For example, WeChat ventured into payments in 2005, two years after Alipay was launched. In 2016, Alipay attempted to incorporate social elements by introducing Quanzi, a feature similar to WeChat’s Moments, but that has proven to be  futile . In 2018, Alipay rolled out its own mini apps – lightweight in-app programs that don’t need to be installed – after  WeChat’s success . 
 Payments and financial services have been an area where WeChat is at the forefront. 
 At the end of 2015, Tencent consolidated its fintech businesses – mobile payment and personal finance – into a separate unit called WeChat Pay. As a result, WeChat Pay’s market share in China doubled to 40% in 2016, and it has maintained that market share ever since. Like Meituan, WeChat also launched a virtual credit card feature called  Fenfu  in late 2019. 
 Picking a space where it has good odds at getting ahead of domestic competitors and that’s not yet dominated by Tencent is a smart move for Alipay.

 “Alipay’s strategy now is to expand from financial services to local services. It is impossible for WeChat to go the same route. WeChat’s foothold will always be social,” says Suning Institute of Finance’s analyst Huang. 
 Services in Alibaba’s ecosystem like Alipay, Taobao, Ele.me are standalone apps that can provide comprehensive features, according to Forrester’s Wang. In WeChat, on the other hand, local services exist largely in the form of mini programs. 
 WeChat launched its local services feature called “mini-program near me” around the same time it introduced mini apps in 2017. 
 WeChat’s approach has been to open up its platform and provide resources and tools for merchants to develop their mini-programs. Meanwhile, Alipay tends to invest or acquire services like what it did with Ele.me and Fliggy, but now it’s following Tencent’s lead by opening up its platform to other services. 
 So which is the “better” super app? 
 WeChat’s edge over Alipay is its social network of  billion-plus users . Social features underpin WeChat’s wide range of services, which is a powerful way to retain and acquire users, and its approach to mini programs allows it to offer local services and beyond. 
 While social has long been its weakness, Alipay offers a variety of lifestyle features. In this respect, it’s equally matched with WeChat. 
 On the other hand, Meituan has a narrower focus, dominating the few areas targets, including delivery for food and groceries. But it does not provide e-government services or bills payment like Alipay and WeChat. 
   
 Everything’s up for grabs 
 The rise of super apps suggests an increasingly saturated mobile app market that’s forcing companies- even established players like Alipay that hold over half of China’s mobile payment market- to reinvent themselves. 
 As people depend more on their phones to meet their daily needs and as the mobile internet population plateaus, super apps will become more prevalent. 
 But over the last decade, the mobile internet population has grown fivefold and hit saturation, giving internet companies in China a new challenge to tackle, according to Suning Institute of Finance’s Huang. As of June 2019, there were  more than 847 million  mobile internet users in the country, accounting for over 99% of its netizens. 
 As we live through perilous times, people are relying more and more on mobile apps to go about their daily lives. 
 The same phenomenon is playing out in other markets, transforming local tech space. In Indonesia, Grab and Gojek are duking it out to be the top super app. And recently, Facebook’s WhatsApp and Jio – the telecommunications unit of Indian conglomerate Reliance – are reportedly  mulling over  the possibility of building a super app like WeChat. 
 Becoming a super app is the end goal for many companies. But in China, it’s especially challenging if you’re not a deep-pocketed, resource-rich tech behemoth like Alibaba or Tencent. 
 “In Southeast Asia, there isn’t a dominant super app like there are WeChat and Alipay in China,” Wang points out. “It’s relatively easy for Grab to foray into payments, for example. The absence of dominant apps gives it time and room to grow and cultivate its market there. Whereas in China, Didi Chuxing (Grab’s Chinese equivalent) faces a strong headwind in doing so with Alipay and WeChat Pay.” ",Nicole Jao,0,8,"[(1, 0.10415127), (2, 0.50685924), (3, 0.38896722)]","['app', 'fintech', 'Reliance', 'Facebook', 'Fliggy', 'Jio', 'Alipay', 'WhatsApp', 'Giants', 'Alibaba', 'netizens']","['Analysys', 'Asia', 'Alipay', 'Taobao', 'Alibaba', 'Indonesia', 'China']"

 The development follows a string of investments into Jio Platforms, which includes a  US$747 million  commitment from US private equity firm Silver Lake earlier this week and a  US$5.7 billion  capital injection from social networking major Facebook two weeks ago. 
 The most recent investment now gives Jio Platforms an equity value of almost US$65 billion and an enterprise value of around US$68.3 billion. It also makes Vista the largest investor in Jio Platforms, behind RIL and Facebook, according to a statement. 
 Vista is a global investment firm that focuses on enterprise software, data, and tech opportunities. It currently has more than US$57 billion in cumulative capital commitments. The company’s portfolio companies also have a significant presence in India, with more than 13,000 employees in the country. 
 “Like our other partners, Vista also shares with us the same vision of continuing to grow and transform the Indian digital ecosystem for the benefit of all Indians,” said RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani. 
 Jio Platforms started its commercial operations in 2016, the same year Ambani invested US$33 billion to build a nationwide 4G broadband service network. It now acts as an umbrella platform for RIL’s digital initiatives such as its apps, digital ecosystems, and 4G data voice call services. 
 Last week, its ecommerce platform JioMart began testing a grocery shopping feature on Facebook’s WhatsApp, following the social network’s multibillion-dollar investment. It was reported that Facebook and Jio Platforms have plans to build a WeChat-like super app for India.

 “I can share with you that the core business is profitable or [making] a small profit,” Didi president Jean Liu said for the first time in an interview with  CNBC . She, however, did not disclose any specific figures or the measure used for gauging profitability. 
 “There has been a very steep drop and a very sharp comeback [in China]. And now you […] can see our business [is] five times [the] February low. So there’s certainty here,” Liu noted, adding that the outbreak has not fundamentally affected Didi’s potential in the long term. 
 Liu also revealed that the Beijing-based company was “overwhelmed” when the outbreak began early this year. 
 Wuhan, the Hubei capital with a population of 11 million and where the virus is believed to have originated, was effectively shut off from the world on January 23. Other parts of the country followed suit, with strict travel restrictions and other measures enforced to limit the movement of people. 
 With travel restrictions now relaxed and Wuhan reopened, Liu said that Didi has seen ride volumes go back to about 60% to 70% of its numbers before the pandemic. 
 “We’re a young player, but we are going global. And from this crisis […] we know that we can leverage our best practice in China and […] share with other countries,” she said. 
 Other ride-hailing companies worldwide are grappling with the impact of the pandemic. 
 Grab’s CEO and founder Anthony Tan recently revealed that the company has seen a  sharp decline  in its ride-hailing segment, with volumes in some markets down by double-digit percentages. Last week, the company said it’s offering its staff no-pay leaves, reduced working hours, and sabbaticals in an effort to weather the crisis. 
 Uber, one of the biggest players worldwide, has also seen lower trip volumes in its ride-hailing business. The US company is set to slash about  3,700 roles  from its total workforce. 
 Didi, meanwhile, has kept its team intact. Liu said that the company has a “strong balance sheet” and that there are no plans for job cuts or fundraising. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(1, 0.9996051)]","['Didi', 'CNBC']","['US', 'Wuhan', 'Beijing', 'Hubei', 'China']"
646580,Indonesian hospitality startup Airy to permanently shut down amid pandemic,"  Airy , an aggregator of budget hotels in Indonesia, said it will permanently cease its operations by the end of this month.

 In an email to its property partners, a copy of which was seen by  Tech in Asia , Airy said it is terminating its agreement with its partners, following the company’s decision to stop its operational activities permanently. 
 Airy explained that the Covid-19 pandemic has threatened almost all business sectors, especially the tourism space. 
 “We have made our best efforts to overcome the impact of this [international] disaster. However, given a significant technical decline and a reduction in human resources that we have at the moment, we have decided to stop our business [activities] in a permanent manner,” the company said in the email. 
 “For this reason, after May 31, 2020, we cannot provide services [anymore] to all our partners,” Airy added. 
  Tech in Asia  reached out to Airy for comment, but a spokesperson for the company was unable to provide more information on the matter. 
 Airy’s shutdown follows that of food logistics startup  Stoqo , which is seen as the first tech casualty of the Covid-19 crisis in Indonesia. 
 In an interview with  Tech in Asia  in March, Airy CEO Louis Alfonso Kodoatie said that the company was  pivoting towards profitability  in an effort to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, which had already affected Airy’s occupancy rate. 
 “We are optimistic that the pandemic will be resolved soon and the travel industry can recover,” Kodoatie said at the time. “With the right technology and service quality, we are sure that Airy can bounce back faster and have our business recovered as before.” 
 However, last month, it was  reported  that the startup laid off about 70% of its staff. 
 Founded in 2015, Airy has a network of 2,000 properties with more than 30,000 rooms. It is also a strategic partner of Indonesian travel unicorn Traveloka. 
 The travel and hospitality industries have been  struggling to survive  since the Covid-19 pandemic prompted governments to issue travel bans worldwide. 
 SoftBank-backed Oyo saw a 50% to 60% drop in revenue and occupancies, forcing the company to implement  pay cuts and furlough its employees . Singapore-based budget hotel startup RedDoorz also offered temporary furloughs to its staff and  laid off less than 10%  of its total workforce.

646571,PriyoShop wins Tech in Asia’s Pitch Night," On April 28,  Tech in Asia  held its first virtual Pitch Night in partnership with human resources software-as-a-service company  HReasily . 
 It was a bustling evening with over 400 attendees conversing, handing out virtual name cards, and voting for their favorite startup. 
 Based in different regions of Southeast Asia, the six finalists gave their best five-minute pitch in front of three investor-judges: Pieter Kemps from Sequoia Capital, Shannon Kalayanamitr of Gobi Partners, and Robert Lomnitz from Xpdite Capital Partners. 
 The startups were then judged based on their clarity of pitch, idea, business model, and investment worthiness. Up for grabs for the night’s winner was full coverage on  Tech in Asia  and a 30-day subscription to  Tech in Asia  Jobs. Meanwhile, the top three startups received Amazon Web Services credits worth US$100, and all the finalists bagged a 30-day subscription to  Tech in Asia  premium news. 
 Here’s an overview of the six startups and their business models. 
 PriyoShop (Winner) 
 Micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) often have less capital, limited access to brands, and lower stock quantities. But PriyoShop aims to solve this by matching small retailers with big brands and helping them manage end-to-end fulfillment – from payments to logistics. 
 Located in Bangladesh, PriyoShop is a marketplace platform that brings ecommerce to the rural parts of India. With its retail-facing app, it enables MSMEs to sell a wide range of products from brands like Asus, Philips, and Samsung directly to their customers. On the other end, its marketplace app allows individual merchants to sell products such as clothing, electronics, and books for its online shoppers. 
    
 ManyOption 
 In Jakarta, people who live in apartments and residential communities face several pain points. Often, building management still bills its residents manually, important information is either incorrectly passed down or not conveyed to tenants entirely; and communication with the front desk when it comes to handling services like deliveries is lacking. 
 ManyOption wants to be the app for everyone’s residential needs. It connects building management with its residents, and its platform can facilitate payment and communication as well. And since ecommerce has become increasingly important in the country, ManyOption also connects residents to nearby merchants where people can manage their own orders and deliveries. 
    
 Ento 
 Alternative protein is on the rise as people become more concerned about nutrition and sustainability. But is this just a fad or is the trend here to stay? 
 Looking at the booming valuations of alternative meat players like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, it might just be the latter. 
 Ento, an alternative protein company, specializes in creating protein from a source that many might find creepy: insects. The company sells products like roasted crickets in Texas-style barbecue flavor and protein powder that’s made from crickets. 
    
 Qiq 
 In many cities worldwide, public transport systems are often overburdened. That’s why Qiq’s mission is to give commuters the freedom to move around affordably and sustainably. 
 In order to achieve this, Qiq designed its own ecosystem of shared electric vehicles such as bicycles, scooters, and two-seater vehicles. The company has already launched its electric bicycle-sharing program in Vietnam, Japan, and Singapore, as well as its electric scooters in certain parts of Vietnam. 
    
 Peak 
 For many small businesses, accounting is a major concern mainly because of a lack of proper bookkeeping. 
 Peak wants to help these firms by equipping them with an automated accounting software. Some of the platform’s features include allowing MSMEs to pay invoices electronically and enabling them to automatically reconcile bank items and prepare tax documents. 
 Besides these, the company also partners with accounting firms to provide accounting and tax services to its users. 
    
 Vechnology 
 Vending machines are great – they work 24 hours a day and are fully operational without much human input. However, most of these machines still have technological challenges and face a difficult time retaining recurring customers. 
 To combat these issues, Vechnology designed and manufactured smart vending machines that accept cashless payments and enable real-time inventory and sales data tracking. The company is also working on a mobile application that will allow users to locate vending machines, top up e-wallets, capture purchase behavioral data, and collect loyalty points. 
    
 Upcoming events 
 Pitch Night isn’t the last of our virtual events – we’ve got our first-ever virtual product development conference in July. With over 30 hours of practical and applicable content, the conference will reveal how startups can scale and grow their products during critical times like a pandemic.

646491,Inside Stoqo’s sudden demise," When  Stoqo , an Indonesian food logistics startup, announced its shutdown last week, it was widely seen as the first tech casualty of Covid-19 in the country. 
 But while Covid-19 did play a part, there were more complex reasons behind its demise. The company had banked on closing a series B fundraise, which would have provided it with a lifeline, but the pandemic’s impact on its revenue and customer base was “too significant, too fast.”

 Meanwhile, employees were informed of the move just one day before Stoqo was due to halt operations. They also had to grapple with a lack of transparency and “messy” communication from the company’s leadership team. 
 Ultimately, closing down seems like the right thing to do, though some wonder if – with a little foresight – Stoqo could have been saved. 
 In a letter sent to employees that  Tech in Asia  read, Stoqo co-founder and CEO Aswin Andrison explained how the shutdown “was not an easy decision to make” and highlighted the “significant revenue drop” that resulted in cash flow challenges. 
 “We have tried every possible option, but as [the days] passed by, our situation became worse, not better,” he wrote. 
 Fundraising plans, interrupted 
 Founded in 2017, Stoqo sells ingredients and other supplies – anything from garlic and ginger to instant coffee and detergent – to food and beverage (F&amp;B) establishments through its platform. 
 Its customer base primarily consists of small and medium-sized F&amp;B establishments. The company had targeted larger restaurant chains in its early days, but it has since shifted away from that strategy, an ex-staff tells  Tech in Asia . Customer testimonials on Stoqo’s website include remarks from a Mexican taco joint and a third-wave coffee shop as well as school canteens and smaller   wartegs   that cater to blue-collar workers. 
 The change in approach appears to have made Stoqo especially vulnerable to a crisis like Covid-19, which has made the “tight cash flow” of the business “untenable,” according to a person with knowledge of the matter. “The company is no longer in a position to operate further at this stage,” the source adds. 
 But in conversations with  Tech in Asia , several current and former employees contended that while Covid-19 was a factor, there were other things at play – so much so that the closure didn’t come as a complete shock. Even though there were no formal indications from management aside from the announcement itself, employees had sensed that there was something going on. 
 A series B fundraise, for instance, had proven difficult. Employees say Stoqo started the process in mid-2019, but no investments were completed until the shutdown. Before this, the company had raised two rounds of investment from backers like Alpha JWC Ventures, Insignia Venture Partners, and Monk’s Hill Ventures.

 Clinching the series B would have helped Stoqo survive. One employee recalls how a team leader who has since left the company remarked that without the series B, the impact on Stoqo’s business would be “huge.” 
 “He said that we needed to close the round by the end of 2019 to ensure that we’re safe for 2020,” the source adds. 
 The current investment climate also seems to have contributed to Stoqo’s fundraising woes. The process was first hampered by the  WeWork debacle   and then by Covid-19, suggests another employee. 
 A source close to the company says that if the pandemic didn’t happen, then the company would have likely had “sufficient runway” to raise the additional funding. 
 But other sources also point out that Stoqo’s business performance had been declining even before sweeping social restrictions to curb Covid-19 were implemented in Jakarta on April 10. One of them claims that the company’s gross merchandise value (GMV) had been trending downwards over the past six months, while another says that the number of daily orders and deliveries had consistently dropped since February 2020. 
 One source close to the company says the GMV claim is “factually incorrect,” adding that Stoqo’s “performance was healthy, with revenues steadily increasing until February 2020,” and it was on track to be unit-economics positive by April 2020. But business was impacted by the  Jakarta floods  in January, and in such a short time, Covid-19 “significantly” hit the company’s revenues to a point where it had no option but to stop operations. 
 Broader issues 
 According to an employee, the short-term reason behind declining orders was quality issues, which in turn pulled down the number of repeat orders. Stoqo had also increased the minimum basket size needed to qualify for free deliveries. 
 But looking at the big picture, there seems to have been a more fundamental problem. Based on this source’s own observation, the company’s process was “too fancy” for its business model. 
 For example, Stoqo supplied customers with various ingredients including chili peppers, which it ordered by the ton on a daily basis. Workers then sorted the chili peppers according to the company’s specifications, but the employee notes the standards it applied were too high. 
 “The chili peppers’ shape has to be straight, not skewed,” the source says. “Often, we had to dispose of stock keeping units (SKUs) that were deemed to be a ‘waste’ when they were still perfectly fine for consumption.” 
 Typically, when distributing fresh produce like fruits and vegetables, the best or grade-A items are supplied to supermarkets. Grade-B or even grade-C items, which may have certain imperfections or deformities but are otherwise fit for consumption, are sent to F&amp;B companies. These items are cheaper as well – it would be more expensive for a restaurant to buy supplies from a supermarket, with its retail prices. 
 Meanwhile, the employee says that Stoqo’s customers rarely complained about pricing. It appears that the company was selling premium produce at grade-B or grade-C prices, which didn’t leave much profit margins. 
 The entire sorting process was also labor-intensive and required more manpower, generating more overheads in the form of higher labor costs and rental fees for larger warehouse space.

 Ultimately, Stoqo’s clients did not seem to demand such premium quality. 
 “There was one day when we were pressed for time, so we didn’t do any sorting and just directly repackaged the chili peppers and sent them to customers,” says the source. “We didn’t receive any complaints that day.” 
 But a person close to the company disputes this account, citing that since Stoqo was a startup, it underwent several “iterations to find best product-market fit and positive unit economics.” Another employee says that he “believes in the business model” and claims that any leftover goods could have been sold to a third-party reseller at a lower price. 
 Yet another former Stoqo staff suggests that there were other issues with the company’s processes, and its troubles were also rooted in the management, company culture, and “growing pains.” Employees that  Tech in Asia  spoke to almost unanimously praised Stoqo’s culture in its early days, though things changed as it scaled to a company with close to 300 employees. 
 “I think as the company grew bigger and there’s more pressure for growth, certain ways of working and operating had to change as well,” says the ex-employee. “For sure, there were things that changed for the better, but some changes were not as favorable.” 
 Asked about Andrison, staff say that he is smart, self-driven, and enjoys mentoring his employees. But when the CEO was busy with tasks like fundraising, he delegated some tasks to middle managers without giving them clear direction, which resulted in decisions like purchasing too many slow-moving goods. Meanwhile, when he was not occupied, he had a tendency to micromanage team leads. 
 “There were times where you were already given [the] trust to lead a team, but sometimes it got interrupted without much context or even discussion,” says a former employee. “Leaders get bypassed.” 
 The right decision 
 Ultimately, Stoqo employees who spoke to  Tech in Asia  agree that all things considered, closing shop was the best decision to make. 
 “If I put myself in the CEO’s shoes, I would probably do the same, honestly,” says an ex-staff. “You can’t keep burning money.” 
 “I think if you’re shutting down during Covid-19, the faster you do it, the better,” says another. 
 Angky William, Stoqo’s co-founder and CTO, also agrees. “I believe that the decision was the right call given the very unfortunate circumstances,” he said in a statement provided to  Tech in Asia . 
 However, the way Stoqo’s shutdown was communicated internally left a lot to be desired, sources say. 
 Andrison had first made the announcement to the entire company on April 21 – just one day before the last day of operations. An employee says the human resources team, which would play an important role in the coming days, was briefed on April 20. 
 However, when the news was initially shared with the public through Stoqo’s website and app, the company said it was shutting down “temporarily” because of large-scale social restrictions in Jakarta. This inconsistency caused confusion among employees, compounded by the rumors that had started swirling around, including from people outside the company. 
 A source familiar with the matter, though, claims that this was an “unfortunate” clerical error that was fixed within hours. 
 In a town hall meeting on April 24, Andrison said the company was holding one-on-one sessions with every employee from April 27 to April 30. During those talks, employees would be presented with two choices: stay with Stoqo but face an uncertain future or voluntarily tender their resignation and (as a goodwill gesture from the company) be eligible for a “farewell package.” 
 Compared to the severance package that a laid-off worker would get under Indonesian law, the farewell money was of a “significantly” smaller sum, according to one employee. But it still included the customary Hari Raya bonus, and a source close to the company affirms that everything was done properly from a legal standpoint.

 Another staffer highlighted outstanding bills from Stoqo’s outsourcing partners – if these vendors don’t get paid, they might withhold wages from their employees, who are primarily warehouse workers. But the source close to the company says that such bills will be settled. 
 Still, some wonder if more could have been done earlier had the leadership been more transparent, especially since social distancing measures at the country’s capital have been a boon for grocery delivery companies. An employee says Stoqo attempted a pivot to business-to-consumer (B2C) in early April, but it was “too late” and done with “suboptimal effort.” 
 A source close to Stoqo says the company needed more time to figure out the unit economics as well as lead generation and customer acquisition strategies for the B2C pivot. At the same time, revenues were already “declining significantly.” 
 Another employee says that around late March or early April, the company’s HR team had been instructed to calculate overall people costs – i.e., salary, Hari Raya bonus, and others – with an intention to cut salaries. But that plan was never implemented. 
 Even now, mid-level managers and other higher-ups would be willing to take a pay cut if it meant helping Stoqo survive, a staffer says. “I am confident that around 65% to 75% of employees are willing to help [voluntarily] if it was clear and transparent from the start what the situation was. Why was the decision made to directly shut down?” 
 In a statement provided to  Tech in Asia , Andrison says that the speed and magnitude of Covid-19’s impact on Stoqo’s business were unforeseen. He added that there were “many learnings for me from this failure,” such as being better at communicating with employees. 
 “We could have been more decisive about shutting down our business operations to give our employees two to three more weeks to process,” he said. “I truly apologize for not being able to deliver on our vision.” ",Putra Muskita,0,9,"[(0, 0.38736436), (3, 0.60832435)]","['app', 'Stoqo', 'Andrison', 'GMV', 'CTO']","['Asia', 'chili', 'Jakarta']"

646264,How fundraising changes in a crisis and what you should keep in mind," The world is in a radically different place from where it was earlier this year. In February, Covid-19 still felt like a faraway problem – something that people read about but did not expect to encounter firsthand. 
 Then before we knew it, the disease had exploded into a full-blown pandemic.

 Given the current environment, founders must question all their assumptions about their businesses and presume that the conviction potential investors may have had in their companies would waver during this trying time. 
 Accounts of Southeast Asian companies having less than three months of cash runway have increased dramatically in the last few weeks. Even those with more runway also have the difficulty of preparing for an unknown future looming in their minds. 
 As liquidity from an unprecedented decade of economic growth dries up, cash is once again king. Investors are much more judicious about how investments are made, focusing on business fundamentals to determine how to allocate their money. 
 What can startups do? 
 When competition for capital intensifies during a crisis, founders must do three things: take an honest and objective look at what creates a moat for their business; shore up cost structures to conserve cash; and persevere in maintaining the trust of their investors. 
 Only after all three are addressed would their companies be in a much stronger position to think about fundraising. 
 Whenever there’s a crisis, investors always stress on a company’s “defensibility.” But make no mistake: While the concept of defensibility in a new economy will certainly look different from before, the principles behind it should not change. Do customers want a certain product, whether there is an economic downturn or an upturn? If the answer is yes, then businesses that provide that product have a moat. 
 Shoring up cost structures is perhaps the single, most vital step to take when there is less capital in the market. To reduce the need to fundraise and extend cash runway, companies should operate with a view of what happens if they are unable to find new capital, if they have difficulties collecting receivables, and if they have limited or no access to credit over a 12- to 24-month time frame. 
 Another point to keep in mind is that the bulk of many startups’ operating expenses are typically driven by personnel costs. During this time, founders must consider headcount reductions along with other tactics, such as compensation cuts, role reassignments, and workday reductions. Being able to make these decisions is what differentiates great leaders from business managers. 
 The knee-jerk reaction of some founders to fundraise in the current climate is probably one of the worst things they can do. Developing new investor relations just before you require capital is never a good idea. With fundraising rounds realistically requiring months of work to execute, any money raised within a short period will likely be too little, too late. This underscores the importance of understanding that investor relations is an ongoing effort, not a one-off exercise in gathering investor commitments. 
 Maintaining relationships with existing investors 
 Thoughtful transparency is instrumental in maintaining a relationship of trust and conviction between founders and investors. It also helps both sides prepare for difficult conversations around renegotiation of terms or funding extensions – scenarios that a founder has to actively consider during this period. Relationships are a two-way process, and understanding each investor’s strengths can help founders leverage them to help their businesses go further. 
 For any CEO, it is important to set a communication system in place with their key backers – monthly updates at a minimum, with meetings scheduled more frequently for close investors. Investors should be kept updated on a company’s operating and financial health and how its leaders intend to solve problems. 
 There are companies that may end up having to accept a flat or down round during this time, which is understandably hard. In the end, company valuations are a measure of what the market would pay for a business at any point in time and, by design, are not static; they fluctuate according to exogenous factors. The truth of the matter is that maintaining a company’s viability during a downturn and over a longer term is more important than its current valuation. 
 If a startup can raise a round even as capital becomes scarce, its founder must keep an open mind and raise from investors with whom they have built relationships. In the current landscape, those who benefit the most from investor support are those who have proven their worth. There is no quick path, as with all things that are built to last. 
 After witnessing the effects of the Asian financial crisis, the dot-com bubble burst, 9/11, the SARS outbreak, and countless other market selloffs, there is one great lesson any company could use to learn: Keep your balance sheet in check and keep your investors close.

646506,Uber lets go of 600 employees in India,"  Update (May 26, 12 pm): This article was updated as Uber confirmed the layoffs in India.  
  Uber  confirmed it has laid off 600 of its employees in India as Covid-19 continues to hit its core ride-hailing segment.

 The US-based company has cut jobs in its driver support, business development, legal, policy, marketing, and finance teams. The move is part of its restructuring plan that has affected a total of  6,700  people this month. 
 “The impact of Covid-19 and the unpredictable nature of the recovery has left Uber India with no choice but to reduce the size of its workforce,” Uber India and South Asia president Pradeep Parameswaran said in a statement. 
 It was earlier reported that Uber would be slashing up to 700 jobs in India, or roughly 25% to 30% of its overall headcount of over 2,000 people in the country, according to sources. 
  Tech in Asia  had also confirmed with a top executive at the company that Uber will be laying off about 20% of its employees, including about 500 staff members in India. 
 In a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated May 2, Uber revealed plans to reduce the headcount for its customer support and recruiting teams by about 3,700, which translates to about 14% of the company’s total workforce, as it sees lower trip volumes in its ride-hailing segment. 
 In addition, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had agreed to waive his base salary for the remainder of the year. 
 In the Middle East, Uber subsidiary Careem had also slashed its workforce by about 31%, affecting 536 employees. The company, however, assured those departing the firm that they would receive severance pay, equity vesting, extended visas, and medical insurance. 
 “Our business is down by more than 80%, and the recovery timeline is alarmingly unknown,” Careem CEO Mudassir Sheikha said in a  statement  on the company’s website. “Our parent company, Uber, believes in our super-app vision and is committed to the region but, like others in the industry, is also impacted by the crisis.” 
 Uber’s online food ordering and delivery platform Uber Eats had also exited eight markets: Czech Republic, Honduras, Egypt, Romania, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, and Uruguay. It also transferred Uber Eats’ operations in the UAE to Careem. 
 In a separate  filing , Uber said that the decision to pull Uber Eats out of those countries was “made as part of Uber’s ongoing strategy to be in first or second position in all Eats markets by leaning into investment in some countries while exiting others.” 
 Uber said that the discontinued and transferred markets represented just 1% of the business’ gross bookings and 4% of its adjusted losses in the first quarter of the year.

 Customers can start shopping by sending a message to Xiaomi’s business account on WhatsApp or logging in on the Mi Commerce web app. They will then be connected to the nearest retail store to view the inventory, place their orders, and have their items delivered. Customers can pay upon delivery. 
 “Mi Commerce is a specially designed platform to cater to the needs of our offline retail partners in the current Covid-19 scenario, and it is Xiaomi’s first step towards a longer-term omnichannel strategy,” Muralikrishnan B, chief operating officer of Xiaomi India, said in a statement. 
 The initiative aims to kickstart Xiaomi’s sales in India, the company’s biggest market outside of China and the world’s second-largest smartphone market. According to research firm Counterpoint, Xiaomi saw zero sales of their smartphones in April during a nationwide lockdown that had started in late March. It also expects the market to  decline by 10%  for the full calendar year. 
 During the virtual briefing for Mi Commerce, Muralikrishnan B said that Xiaomi doesn’t want to portray the new service as a  competitor  to other ecommerce platforms, as it’s designed to help its retail partners amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The company is also offering working capital through loans for its offline retailers. 
 As India begins to relax its lockdowm measures, Xiaomi expects almost 60% of its partner stores to resume operations soon. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(3, 0.99949145)]","['Xiaomi', 'Counterpoint', 'WhatsApp']","['India', 'China']"
646457,"TikTok capturing users’ hearts, but not the marketers’ bucks?"," Tech startups would turn green at how quickly TikTok has emerged to rival companies such as Netflix, YouTube, Snapchat, and Facebook. With over 700 million downloads in 2019,  it overtook Facebook  and its messenger app as well as Instagram, and Snapchat. It’s now the world’s second most downloaded app, just behind WhatsApp. 
 Analysis by Business of Apps supports this, with the media company reporting that the platform’s penetration is  at its highest in Asia , where over a third of users aged 16-64 have a TikTok account.

 However, according to estimates seen by  Tech in Asia , TikTok is still trailing behind the Facebook family of apps in the region when it comes to monthly active users (or MAUs), though the caveat is that the platform is the new kid on the block. 
 The Bytedance-owned app is closing in on the competition, though, rising up one spot to eighth place in Indonesia and Malaysia since January, according to mobile app analytics firm App Annie. It also debuted at seventh place in the Philippines in March. 
 It’s a similar picture when it comes to TikTok’s download stats in Southeast Asia, according to estimates from App Annie and Sensor Tower. “In the first quarter [of 2020], TikTok had more downloads than Facebook’s apps (Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram) in the region,” says Sensor Tower’s mobile insights strategist Craig Chapple. 
 Corresponding with the data is Bytedance’s statement to  Tech in Asia  regarding the app’s “rapid growth” outside of China, especially in Southeast Asia where it “received an overwhelming response.” The company’s spokesperson, however, declined to reveal exact figures or its plans for expansion. 
 At face value, Facebook and TikTok are competing to capture users’ hearts, with the latter attempting to take a leaf out of its predecessor’s book by  poaching Facebook employees  to shore up its talent pool. But beneath the surface, there’s a bigger fight brewing for the social media platforms: advertising dollars. 
 With TikTok’s impressive user engagement scorecard and  ballooning revenues , one could easily assume that marketers would have been all over the 15-second video app by now. But that isn’t the case. 
 Half of the 10 agencies  Tech in Asia  have spoken to have yet to work with clients looking to advertise on the app, while the rest say that their clients are spending less than 10% of their advertising budgets on TikTok. 
 Not really built for performance-based advertising 
 The latter is the case for  Hustlr , a content marketing agency that works with clients in the APAC region. Its founder Jeremy Ong attributes this to TikTok’s machine-learning algorithm and user behavior-tracking capabilities, which he says are not as “mature” as Facebook and Google’s. 
 “Clients are looking for specific outcomes like sales, web and app conversions, in-store visits and lead generation,” he tells  Tech in Asia , adding that Facebook and Instagram serve these goals better for now. 
 “TikTok is not really built for performance-based advertising. That’s why it’s taking up only about 2-3% of our total advertising spend per month across all our clients,” says Marcus Ho, managing director of Singapore-based digital marketing agency  Brew Interactive . 
 In response, TikTok says it is “evolving” how it measures advertising value by working closely with brands to provide them “comprehensive and creative advertising solutions.” These include developing hashtag challenges and content conceptualization, as well as tracking and analytics. 
 While Ho finds TikTok less effective in terms of advertising, he acknowledges that it works better for general brand engagement through branded content. “Engagement rate is at an all-time high with that platform.” 
 TikTok’s boon is also its bane 
 Ong, and most marketers that have used the platform, agree that TikTok’s “young” user base, a factor that has contributed to its rapid growth, is also its Achilles’ heel. “Young users usually don’t have strong spending power, hence resulting in fewer conversions.” 
 However, a TikTok spokesperson says it’s a “common misconception” that the platform is used only by a certain demographic, adding there are users of “all ages active on the app.” The app’s key focus is diversifying its content, “no matter what age [the users] may be.” 
 Besides this, other marketers take this perceived lack of purchasing power among young TikTok users in stride. Shenzhen-based short video company  Uplab  tells  Tech in Asia  that it has found success in running ads for products that sell for less than RMB30 (US$4.25). 
 “Trying to sell a S$500 (US$352) watch won’t be effective on the platform,” says the firm’s founder and growth director, Fabian Ouwehand. 
 Ong concedes that although the young users on TikTok do not have spending power yet, they will in the years to come. For him, capturing the “millennial” target group will pay dividends in the future, as “more TikTok users will start participating in the labor market.” 
 Hong Kong-based  Digital Business Lab  agrees. Its founder and general manager Albin Lix says his clients are looking to grow their audience on TikTok so they can start communicating with their “future clients.” 
 “The top challenge for our clients is to develop brand-building that targets millennials under 30 years of age, as this population is massive in Southeast Asia, representing 50% of the population,” he says. He also acknowledges that appealing to this demographic requires its own set of skills. 
 “TikTok reflects the evolution of society. Right now, the younger generation is looking for meaningful relationships with brands.” 
 What makes a good TikTok ad? 
 For Digital Business Lab, a good TikTok ad focuses on content that not only captures users’ attention but is also relatable to them. The latter is the most important measure of an ad’s success, says Lix. 
 “User attention metrics is the new KPI.” He adds that TikTok ads need to be funny and entertaining to keep users from scrolling past them. 
 Red Bull, Nike, and NBA are among the brands that have “very strong presence” on TikTok, and a  Red Bull advertisement  is a prime example of how “subtle product placement” is used as a tactic to raise brand awareness among users, Lix says. 
 “A soft ad [features] product-placement within the story, something that is effective [in driving] return on investment (ROI),” he explains. “Hard ads, like those you see on Facebook or Instagram, are less effective as they disturb the user experience.” 
 Ong agrees that TikTok ads have to take the “soft” approach, as users can “smell someone selling to them right away.” Brands must creatively integrate a product or service into the message “without being pushy,” he advises. 
   ﻿   
 For Ho, a good TikTok ad involves jumping on any of the numerous TikTok challenges trending online, given that comedy “rules the platform.” Brands must “produce content that is native and relevant to the TikTok audience.” 
 Digital Business Lab’s Lix points out that TikTok has a “large” pool of global users, which is unprecedented for an app that has its origins in China. While TikTok and Douyin remain separate apps for now, there remains untapped potential to integrate both apps on the advertising front to allow brands to reach Chinese and non-Chinese audiences at the same time. 
 However, he says that TikTok’s Chinese roots could also hinder its rapid growth, cautioning, “It would not be surprising to see American institutions trying to hold [off] Chinese social media growth in the US, since Facebook and Instagram are still officially banned in China.” 
 But Ong remains bullish on TikTok’s potential, forecasting that it will soon become a “major player in advertising.” 
 “It’s only a matter of time until TikTok becomes the ‘go-to’ social media platform for reaching the masses,” he concludes.

 The price of its shares increased from its initial public offering of 350 rupiah to 384 rupiah within the first four minutes after trading opened on Monday, the  Jakarta Post  reported. 
 Cashlez said it will use the 87.5 billion rupiah or almost US$5.8 million raised from its IPO, conducted on April 27, for its expansion. It plans to use more than 61% of the funds to acquire Softorb Technology Indonesia, an IT company focused on smart card technology. The remaining funds, meanwhile, will be used as working capital, according to Cashlez’s president director Tee Teddy Setiawan. 
 Established in 2015, the company offers a mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) system that allows merchants to accept payments with credit and debit cards or app-based debit cards on smartphones connected by a card reader via bluetooth. Its system also supports other digital payment methods such as QR code payments and Cashlez Link. 
 With the acquisition, the company plans to increase the number of merchants in its network from 7,000 to 10,000 by the end of this year. Around 88% of its customers are micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. 
 It also looks to increase its gross transaction value by 3x this year, up from nearly US$252,000 last year. 
 In 2017, Cashlez raised  US$2 million  from state-owned Bank Mandiri’s venture capital arm Mandiri Capital and Gan Kapital, followed by an undisclosed amount of  series A money  led by Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo Corporation last year.

 The new investment was co-led by Vickers Venture Partners, energy and resources firm Flint Hills Resources, Swiss pension fund CPV/CAP Pensionskasse Coop, and Interogo Holding-linked International SA. Existing investors Eversource Retirement Plan Master Trust and WI Harper Group also participated in the round, according to a statement. 
 Founded in 2015, RWDC develops sustainable and earth-friendly materials to use as substitutes for plastic in a wide range of everyday consumer goods such as straws, utensils, cups, plates, and lids. Particularly, it uses polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a fully biodegradable biopolymer material primarily produced from used cooking oil. 
 The startup said it will use the new funds to meet the growing demand for PHA. To do so, it plans to expand its production capacity by repurposing an idle factory in Athens, Georgia to be its new facility. It also looks to invest some of the new capital in research and development efforts. 
 RWDC said the investment comes at a time when demand for single-use plastic alternatives continues to rise due to regulatory demands from different governments worldwide. 
 “This investment will help us significantly increase our production capacity [and] meet the needs of brand owners who want to improve the lives of their customers by offering materials that have a positive effect on human health while improving environmental stewardship,” said RWDC co-founder and CEO Daniel Carraway. 
 The latest funding follows RWDC’s oversubscribed  US$22 million  series A3 round, which was led by Vickers Venture Partners in April last year. Prior to that, it had raised  US$13 million  in a series A2 round in October 2018. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.99936163)]","['RWDC', 'PHA']","['Georgia', 'US', 'Athens']"

 Hundreds of thousands of offline tutoring units in India, commonly called coaching centers, act as the primary source of academic support for more than 70 million students taking private lessons in the country every year. 
 Classplus aims to digitize this market by helping tutors run all their communications, payments, assessments, and learning programs online on their smartphones. 
 Its mobile-centric solution also acts as a digital distribution platform for educational content and products, enabling tutors to set up ecommerce channels to make video content and online assessments available to students. 
 The startup said it plans to use the new funds to improve its technology and expand its product offerings. It also looks to bolster its product, engineering, and business teams as well as make strategic hires for some leadership roles to drive its expansion. 
 According to Mukul Rustagi, the co-founder and CEO of Classplus, India is home to the largest after-school tuition market globally. “As national examinations move online, so must after-school tuition practices […],” he added. 
 Rustagi, along with co-founder Bhaswat Agarwal, launched Classplus in 2018. Since then, the startup has served over 1 million students across more than 70 Indian cities, with upward of 3,500 coaching centers using its technology.

 The series A funding comes less than three months after the startup raised  US$10.5 million  in seed money from Alpha JWC Ventures, Wavemaker Partners, and Pavilion Capital. 
 GudangAda will use the new funds to continue investing in its technology platform, launch new business initiatives, and bolster its team, it said in a statement. 
 Launched in 2018, the Jakarta-based company connects merchants, wholesalers, and mom and pop retailers in the fast-moving consumer goods space to meet and transact online. 
 GudangAda said its platform can help merchants grow with faster inventory turnover, more optimal pricing, wider product selection, and better buyer-seller discovery, as well as improved order management and enhanced analytics. 
 “B2B supply chains in many emerging markets face challenges around working capital limitations, inefficient inventory management, and manual operational processes,” said Abheek Anand, managing director at Sequoia Capital (India) Singapore. “GudangAda is building a digital ecosystem to transform the massive and highly fragmented FMCG market in Indonesia.” 
 Today, wholesalers and retailers in the archipelago are being pushed to adopt digital solutions to cope with the limitations set by the Covid-19 pandemic. The startup said the new funds will enable it to support the supply chain. 
 It has already launched a pilot logistics service to help maintain the availability of essential products in the local supply chain. The service, which currently operates in Greater Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Medan, and Lampung, will later be expanded to cover other major cities nationwide within the next few months, the company said. 
 GudangAda assured that its business continues to show growth despite the pandemic. It is maintaining a no lay-off policy and continues to recruit talent. 
 The startup also said it’s targeting 7% to 10% of the nation’s large retailer base for its next phase of growth. According to a statement, it currently connects over 50,000 large retailers and covers nearly 100% of FMCG wholesalers across 500 cities in Indonesia.

646368,Here’s how AI is changing the money lending landscape," Getting a loan from conventional lenders is difficult. It requires a lot of paperwork and weeks – if not months – of waiting to hear back about an application. 
 These lenders also rely on traditional credit-scoring measures such as reports and factors, like the  5Cs of credit , to determine loan eligibility. 
 While it’s easy to get an accurate credit score in developed countries, that’s not the case in developing markets such as India and Indonesia, where a large portion of the population remain unbanked and are thus ineligible for loans from banks and legal moneylenders. As such, people often  turn to unlicensed lenders  and end up trapped in debt. 
 This is where AI comes in. With its ability to parse and analyze large volumes of data, it’s  transforming how the lending industry works . 
 AI for alternative credit scoring 
 Dmitry Voronenko, CEO and co-founder of AI-powered lending software provider  Turnkey Lender , says that artificial intelligence opens up the possibility of using different metrics to assess a borrower’s credit score. 
 For instance, looking at the data of an individual’s mobile phone reveals when they pay their bills and the types of goods and services they pay for, as well as indicates whether they’re constantly moving locations – factors that can determine their creditworthiness.

 Someone who uses an expense tracking app regularly is also more likely to be financially savvy, and thus be more able to pay back a loan. 
 Even how long a person spends filling out a loan application on a website can be an indicator of their financial capability. 
 “[The number of] times the borrower selects and changes the loan amount and the loan duration [when filling in the form] says a lot about their current situation,” explains Voronenko. “If you change it six times in three minutes, something’s up.” 
 The same logic applies to businesses as well, especially smaller enterprises that can’t meet traditional scoring methods, making them immediately ineligible to receive loans from banks. Other indicators, such as the frequency and size of their transactions, can paint a clearer picture of their creditworthiness. 
 Turnkey Lender aggregates these disparate pieces of information and analyzes them, giving lenders a better understanding of how likely borrowers can pay back their debts. 
 The platform also cuts down the time and manpower required for lenders to process applications and issue loans, and their reduced operating costs help drive interest rates down. 
 Lending during a pandemic 
 The Covid-19 pandemic has driven home the importance of AI and how it can change the lending industry. 
 Businesses and individuals that, mere months ago, were in great financial shape are now scrambling to stay afloat by applying for loans. But because of the crisis, credit bureaus have decreased access to accurate data regarding their financial status. 
 So while the demand for loans is  on the rise  , lenders are getting more cautious about borrowers who will default on their obligations.

 Using bank account statements or e-wallet payment data, such as payment frequency, makes determining credit scores more accurate. AI can look at this information in real time, unlike traditional credit bureaus that often take several months to do so. 
 With alternative credit-scoring measures, lenders can better evaluate potential clients as well. 
 Companies, for instance, are exploring in-house lending options to provide loans or other forms of assistance to partners who are in financial distress. An example is offering buy-now, pay-later short-term financing alternatives that can increase revenue and keep clients loyal during these difficult times. 
 “There is this trend where non-lenders, who never dreamed of being lenders, are starting to offer financial services,” says Voronenko. 
 These companies often have valuable alternative data about their clients, such as usage patterns, preferences, and buying habits, which enable them to better evaluate their creditworthiness. 
 AI enables these companies to extract this information and promptly determine whom to finance and what amount to offer them to automate the in-house lending process. 
 The future of lending 
 The impact of AI is immense, going as far as changing the way people in the industry communicate with borrowers, says Voronenko. 
 Using the technology, lenders can find out what kind of tone and messaging are most suitable for a specific debtor, which is handy information, as  using the right approach  when contacting a customer can increase the likelihood of loans getting repaid on time. 
 Ultimately, Voronenko believes that beyond Covid-19, AI will open digital lending to a bigger variety of businesses, allowing lending to be  embedded into different industries . 
 “It will be like cinemas and Netflix,” he explains. “Banks will be [like] cinemas, where you go to for bigger, complex loans. But the majority of loans can be provided by smaller companies, making [lending] more accessible.”

646075,Why Indonesia’s economy will experience a boom in this decade,"   
 ||item|| 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
 By going digital, Indonesia can unleash  US$150 billion  in annual economic impact by 2025. Its government is also on a mission to become the world’s fifth-largest economy by 2045, with a target gross domestic product of  US$7.3 trillion . 
 If you’re a founder or corporate leader with your sights set on Indonesia, the time to grab this opportunity is now. 
 ABOUT 
 When a country’s working-age group is bigger than its nonproductive population, it earns a “demographic bonus,” which accelerates economic growth. For Indonesia, the demographic bonus will peak by 2030 when  64% of its 297 million-strong populace  will be productive. 
 But it’s too early to celebrate. Besides poor infrastructure and job availability, the country contends with many challenges, including poverty, underprepared new graduates entering the workforce, relatively low access to higher education, and cultural issues surrounding gender roles. 
   
  The rise of entrepreneurship  
Despite Indonesia having a large available workforce, job opportunities may be scarce. That’s why President Joko Widodo set up a program in 2016 to support young entrepreneurs and accelerate the country toward Industry 4.0, with the hope that major innovations can lead to more jobs. 
 According to a report by the World Economic Forum,  34.1%  of young Indonesians “worked for themselves” in 2019. Among ASEAN countries, it has the highest share of youth with entrepreneurship aspirations. 
 The government hopes that such programs can expand the country’s middle class, which has become the fastest-growing socioeconomic group in the country. Indonesia’s poverty rate has more than halved since 1999, resulting in at least  52 million  Indonesians – one in every five people – becoming economically secure. 
   
  Education is critical  
Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim recently became the country’s education minister. While his plans involve increased investment and innovation through private sector collaborations, education becoming a gateway to high-paying jobs is still a dream for most Indonesians. Just 14.43% of the population have postsecondary education, and many still fall into blue-collar work in the informal sector, which typically offers low incomes and little career growth. 
 Vocational schools seem to be one of the government’s priorities. In 2018, the unemployment rate of graduates from these institutions stood at  8.92%  – higher than the country’s overall unemployment rate of 4.3% that year. However, the government said it would revitalize 5,000 out of the archipelago’s 14,000 vocational schools by the end of 2024. The Covid-19 outbreak has also led the government to launch  a pre-employment card  for vocational training, though its effectiveness is still up for debate. 
   
  More female workers  
In Indonesia, female participation in the workforce remains low because of the  cultural dynamics  surrounding gender roles. According to the International Labor Organization, there are more than  35 million  nonworking Indonesian females between 15 to 64 years old. 
 While there has been some growth in this area, the rise is mostly limited to young educated females in urban locations. Ultimately, this is still far from the East Asia and Pacific region average of  67.7% . If online platforms could empower just  3%  of women in the country, it would add 1 million people to the workforce. 
   
   
  Internet users on the rise  
In 2018,  64.8% of Indonesians  were internet users – that’s an increase of 10.12% from 2017. However, 55% came from Java, the nation’s most populous and developed island. 
 To improve this, the government launched the  Palapa Ring Project  with the aim of connecting 500 regencies (administrative divisions of Indonesia) with 4G internet services. However, even though the project was finished in 2019, it has only seen  30% to 60% utilization  of the infrastructure that was built. If that number is improved, digital technologies could potentially increase Indonesia’s GDP by  US$35 billion and create 3.7 million jobs . 
 The country’s digital economy itself can reach  US$130 billion  by 2025 and can accelerate the government’s goal of 3,500 startups by the same year, according to the 2019 e-Conomy SEA report. 
 CONCLUSION 
 To fully utilize the demographic bonus, Indonesia needs to maintain a GDP growth of at least  5% until 2045 . Things have certainly improved, but there’s still a lot of work to be done. 
 If the country’s digital infrastructure isn’t ready for the incoming productive population, this demographic bonus could turn into a big burden instead. But with the government making the right investments – especially in tapping into the hidden potential of rural areas – Indonesia can reap big benefits from this rare window of opportunity.

646366,WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann sues SoftBank over canceled tender offer," Adam Neumann, the co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has filed a lawsuit against the company’s biggest investor, SoftBank Group, and its Vision Fund for not completing a US$3 billion tender offer to the company’s shareholders.

 The tender offer was part of the US$9.5 billion bailout program that SoftBank promised WeWork last year after the co-working startup shelved its IPO plans. The package also included a US$1.5 billion injection from SoftBank and US$5 billion in debt financing. 
 Neumann, who could sell up to US$970 million in stock to SoftBank, was expected to be the biggest beneficiary of the transaction. 
 “The abuses committed by (SoftBank) and SBVF (SoftBank Vision Fund) are so brazen that they have prompted legal action by a special committee of WeWork’s board,” the lawsuit, which was filed on Monday in the Delaware Chancery Court, said, as quoted by  Reuters . 
 In response, SoftBank’s chief legal officer, Rob Townsend, described the claims as “meritless.” “Under the terms of our agreement, which Adam Neumann signed, SoftBank had no obligation to complete the tender offer,” Townsend was quoted as saying in a statement. 
 A special committee of WeWork’s board also  sued  SoftBank for backing out of the tender offer, asking the Japanese conglomerate to complete the deal or pay compensatory damages. 
 SoftBank said in early April that  it will not be moving forward  with the tender offer, citing several unmet conditions and regulatory probes into the startup. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.9993999)]","['Reuters', 'WeWork', 'SoftBank']",[]
646354,How Razer joined the X-Force," Razer’s commitment to the community has put the gaming company in the spotlight. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, it recently launched a manufacturing line to address the shortage of masks in Southeast Asia and set up a US$50 million fund to support its business partners. 
 To help readers learn more about these initiatives and how Razer was able to act quickly during a critical time,  Tech in Asia  organized a fireside chat with the company’s chief investment officer, Edwin Chan, and its chief strategy officer, LiMeng Lee. 
 During the one-hour virtual event, the two discussed the factors that helped the company strategize and implement a quick response to the effects of the pandemic. These include having businesses and offices across the globe, which helps alert the firm to imminent global issues; laying a strong financial, strategic, and technological foundation to ensure it is ready and secured for any crisis; and fostering a work culture that encourages employees to be decisive self-starters. 
   ﻿   
 For companies that want to replicate Razer’s speed in adapting during a crisis, Chan and Lee advised leaders to be aggressive to avoid the cost of indecision but, at the same time, to stay vigilant. As the pandemic continues and new measures are implemented, they must think of backup plans for when the situation changes. According to the duo, while speed is important in launching a new project, knowing when to shut it down when it is not working is equally critical. 
 The two believe that the next era of startups and companies will give rise to businesses that digitize daily life: contactless deliveries, streaming services that also function as communication tools, and the robotic automation of food and beverage enterprises. Bubble tea served by robotic arms may soon be a possibility. 
 Startups always encounter new challenges, and the current situation amplifies this. By sharing Razer’s strategies on how to adapt faster, we hope that this event will help the Southeast Asian tech community pull through during this period.

646348,Why it’s wrong to stop covering startup layoffs," Dear readers, 
 Retrenchments have become the norm these days, so much so that  one venture capitalist  is calling on the media to refrain from covering layoffs among startups amid the pandemic as they lack resources to keep people. 
 “It would be the higher ground,” he writes, and many echo his sentiment. While I agree that we shouldn’t report about all layoffs, I do think abstaining from it would be a disservice to the tech community. 
 
  Photo credit:  123rf.  
 
 It’s been said that “journalism is the first rough draft of history,” a saying goes, and it entails digging for the truth, no matter what we unearth. 
 As much as we empathize with founders, startup employees also need to be heard, and they’re the ones who’ve been reaching out to us. Their perspectives matter. 
 While many startups have attributed their woes to Covid-19, some have gone too far and glossed over how bad management decisions led to their predicament. 
 Indeed, we hope that through our coverage, employees and founders can better appreciate what they’re in for by being part of a startup. 
 It seems that it’s a case of damned if you do, and damned if you don’t. Tech media has been criticized for shilling startups, and yet we also get flogged for using our magnifying glasses. 
 That said, the crew at  Tech in Asia  has adjusted how it reports about layoffs in these tough times. With more retrenchments happening, we’re more selective about which ones we cover. We’re also making it a point to scrutinize the  why  behind the layoffs and not just the  what . 
 Anyway, let’s move on to our premium stories. We looked into the  internal fault lines at Zilingo  and how that played into its recent layoffs. Questions are arising about whether it can sustain its momentum. 
 Over the weekend, we worked hard to bring you an exclusive on the  major layoffs at Oriente , a prominent fintech startup with a strong pedigree. What’s happening at the company is also occurring at other online lenders – a counter-intuitive development.

646238,India’s Jio Platforms secures $747m from US-based Silver Lake,"  Jio Platforms , the digital services arm of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), is set to receive US$747 million of investment from US private equity firm Silver Lake. 
 The announcement comes less than two weeks after Jio bagged  US$5.7 billion  from social networking giant Facebook. 
 According to a statement, the latest investment gives Jio an equity value of nearly US$65 billion and an enterprise value of around US$68 billion, representing a 12.5% premium to the valuation of the Facebook investment.

 As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to affect businesses globally, Silver Lake’s investment in Jio Platforms has a special significance. 
 “Comprehensive digitization will be a vital component of the revitalization of the Indian economy,” RIL said in a statement. 
 Having about US$40 billion in combined assets and committed capital, Silver Lake has invested in a wide array of tech companies worldwide including Skype, Ant Financial, Twitter, Airbnb, and Didi Chuxing. 
 Jio started commercial operations in 2016, acting as an umbrella platform for RIL’s digital initiatives such as its apps, digital ecosystems, and 4G data voice call services. Its US$5.7 billion raise from Facebook followed reports saying that the two companies were in talks to build a WeChat-like super app.

646217,GoBear acquires Singapore fintech startup AsiaKredit," Financial marketplace  GoBear  today announced that it has acquired the Singapore-based  AsiaKredit , an end-to-end digital consumer lender. 
 The deal is in line with GoBear’s plans to expand its regional reach and drive growth through digital lending, according to a statement. It follows the company’s  US$80 million  raise from venture capital firm Walvis Participaties and financial services provider Aegon in May last year.

 With the acquisition, GoBear said it will introduce “lending-as-a-service” to its network of more than 100 partners, helping them offer loans to underserved consumers in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. It will also expand its direct consumer lending service through AsiaKredit’s Pera247, a consumer lending app in the Philippines. 
 “The establishment of an industry-leading lending business is a critical component of GoBear’s strategy to support our banking partners in providing loans to the many underserved consumers in Asia,” said Adrian Chng, CEO of GoBear. “The acquisition will allow GoBear to accelerate strategic plans by giving us access to end-to-end digital lending capabilities.” 
 Established in Singapore in early 2015, GoBear describes itself as a financial supermarket where users can find financial know-how, tools, and products for their needs. It currently operates in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. 
  See:  GoBear sees a ‘multibillion’ opportunity in bridging Southeast Asia’s credit needs   
 The company says it has served over 40 million users to date, with revenue from its consumer finance products increasing by over 100% last year. 
 AsiaKredit, meanwhile, claims it has processed over 1 million loan applications and achieved more than 100x growth in loans disbursed in the last two years. 
 According to a study by Bain &amp; Company, access to credit remains a challenge for many in Southeast Asia, with more than 70% of the population – about 296 million people – still underbanked or unbanked. 
 GoBear also noted that it will become increasingly important to provide consumers with access to credit, as economic growth in developing countries may decline this year given the Covid-19 pandemic.

646190,These startups could unlock ecommerce’s true potential in Indonesia," Many ecommerce platforms have hit a wall in Indonesia. Despite billions in US dollars in investments, traditional ecommerce players like Tokopedia and Shopee have a long way to go to win over the rural population. While people in Greater Jakarta are spending a third of their household expenditure online, those who live far from the country’s capital are still reluctant to do that, according to  data from the Indonesian government  and Google’s eConomy report.

 Why do people in the countryside still prefer offline transactions? Rusli Abdullah, a researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance cites two reasons: lack of internet access and limited payment options. Only 22% of rural residents in Indonesia have internet access, including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, he says. And of those with access, only 42% of them have a bank account. 
 “Meanwhile, ecommerce transactions usually require people to deposit money in a bank account or mobile payment first,” adds Abdullah.

 Even if rural people have bank accounts or can do mobile payments, their funds might be low because most of them sell agriculture products and have irregular daily or weekly income. 
 “That’s why they still prefer offline transactions and payment in cash – they only have to pay when the goods are there. It’s really different [from] private or public employees who have a monthly income and are less reluctant to deposit money,” Abdullah explains. 
 Despite these challenges and logistics-related issues, a prominent venture capitalist in Indonesia thinks that it’s only a matter of time before traditional ecommerce reaches the countryside and people’s behavior “will shift.” 
  See:  Indonesia’s stunning growth doesn’t tell the full story   
 A new wave of startups in Indonesia, however, believe that they can overcome these barriers faster by marketing, distributing, and selling products through a network of human agents. Called  social commerce , this model still uses online tools but it’s distinct from traditional ecommerce in several ways:

  Customer service  
  Online  
  Offline via agents  
 
  
  Super , which focuses on selling fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), is one such company. Right now, it has zero transactions in the Greater Jakarta area. 
 Steven Wongsoredjo, Super’s chief executive, believes that in rural areas, social commerce has an advantage over traditional ecommerce. For example, most rural folk are not used to dealing with online customer service to solve transaction problems. Instead, they prefer to meet representatives like social commerce’s agents in person, he says. 
 But as the world grapples with Covid-19, when mass gatherings are forbidden and social distancing is the new norm, social commerce agents are turning to SMS or messaging apps to reach their customers. 
 Since the government has  not implemented a total lockdown , people can still meet in person to do cash payment and collect goods. But Super isn’t taking any chances amid the pandemic. “We provide tools like masks, face shields, gloves, and plastic bags. We also encourage them to wash their hands and use hand sanitizer after every transaction,” shares Wongsoredjo.

 The CEO observes that by focusing on middle-class consumers outside Greater Jakarta, social commerce in the country can have a total addressable market of US$200 billion – a third of Indonesian household yearly expenditure. But the business model is still in its “early phase,” and he expects that it will take around 10 to 12 years to hit that number. 
 “It will reach an inflection point in the next five years, when people have realized what social commerce and its function,” Wongsoredjo says. 
 Unlike Super, other social commerce startups like  Chilibeli  and  Woobiz  are still targeting Greater Jakarta’s urban population. However, they offer products that city dwellers can still buy offline, like groceries. 
 “There are still many housewives who go shopping for groceries at traditional markets. But many of these markets are in poor condition – they’re wet and dirty. That’s why we offer a community-based grocery shopping experience,” a Chilibeli representative says. 
 Selling through agents is similar to community selling and multilevel marketing, according to a senior executive from a regional logistics firm. Instead of being based on marketing expenditure and brand trust, social commerce banks on agent commission and community trust, he says. 
 “Outreach is higher, easier, and more engaging because you can leverage digital media,” the executive explains. 
 Marketing through agents 
 Another key difference between social commerce and traditional ecommerce is on how they do marketing. 
 Traditional ecommerce players usually use “one-way” marketing through digital media. They also sometimes pay influencers to create a viral effect. 
 On the other hand, social commerce startups generally try to create traffic through either group buying or reselling. They depend on face-to-face meetings and WhatsApp’s groups feature, which is widely used in Indonesia’s local communities. 
 Here are the other differences between group buying and reselling: 
  
 
  
  Group Buying  
  Reselling  
 
 
  Growth engine  
  End customers  
  Agents  
 
 
  Incentive to promote products  
 
 Customers can get cheaper prices   if there are more people who buy   the same product 
 
 
 Agents can get commission   from every transaction 
 
 
  
 Most social commerce startups in Indonesia build and rely on a network of resellers by combining digital marketing and offline events. These agents get a mobile app that comes with a detailed product list, which they can share to end customers. 
 Some players like Chilibeli also provide a mobile app for end customers. But consumers still have to pick a specific agent via the app because their orders will be delivered to the resellers, who will then send the groceries to the end customers. 
 Majority of social commerce agents are housewives aged between 25 to 40 years old who want additional income for their families. They can get commissions of up to 10% from every transaction. 
 “It is a more powerful yet personalized [marketing] method because of its significant potential reach. An average agent might have 150 to 200 WhatsApp contacts,” says Woobiz CEO Putri Noor Shaqina. WhatsApp’s “forward message” feature can expand that contact list even further, she adds.

 Super’s Wongsoredjo admits that it’s possible for traditional ecommerce players with big funding to allocate money and develop their own network of agents. However, identifying the right people who can bring orders is the real challenge. 
 “Every community has a different culture, so we need different approaches to win their hearts to join us. We also need to do a thorough survey before deciding which products can work well in the area so we can retain the agents,” Wongsoredjo says. 
 Some agents also lack the drive to aggressively promote the products while others live in areas that sometimes inaccessible to delivery trucks. 
  See:  After social ecommerce’s success in China, Webuy tests the waters in Southeast Asia   
 The background of Super’s founding team informs its approach to handling agents. They may have studied overseas, but they also come from Tier 2 Indonesian cities. “It’s easier to execute on the ground and choose the best business model to evolve the venture going forward,” Wongsoredjo says. 
 To boost retention, Indonesian social commerce startups usually ensure that existing agents first get a monthly commission worth around US$100 to US$200 before scaling their networks in massive numbers. Another way to keep agents is by giving them loyalty points that can be exchanged for merchandise or to sponsor their  umrah  or a minor pilgrimage to Mecca. 
 Offering cheaper prices 
 Startups like Super combine reselling with group buying by aggregating orders first before collectively shipping out the products. 
 “If the orders are above US$200, we will deliver to the agents’ houses. However, if the orders are below US$200, agents need to pick them up from the nearest Super Center (distribution hub) in the village. We have a policy of US$70 minimum order for the smaller-basket agents,” Wongsoredjo explains. 
 By pooling the orders, social commerce startups can buy products in bulk directly from manufacturers at cheaper prices. This in turn allows agents to sell the goods at competitive prices. Wongsoredjo claims that some of Super’s top  stock keeping units  or SKUs can be 10% cheaper compared to market prices.

 What Super actually does is to bypass the traditional FMCG supply chain, which consists of intermediaries like wholesalers and distributors. As such, Wongsoredjo is aware that the startup could come into conflict with more established players. 
 “I have friends in Big Manufacturing, and they say that their relationship with those middlemen is like a family,” he shares. 
 To avoid friction, Super doesn’t take in wholesalers and big retailers as its agents. Instead, it only accepts owners of  warungs  – mom and pop shops that are found across neighborhoods in Indonesia – and individuals, who are typically at the end of traditional supply chains. This way, both Super and incumbent players can continue to operate without killing each other’s business. 
 “We also don’t burn money to give significant discounts, so the price range for end customers is still normal,” Wongsoredjo says. 
 
  Traditional ecommerce vs. social commerce supply chain flow 
 
 Other Indonesian startups like Kudo and Payfazz have also recruited  warungs  as agents for their payment business.  Kudo  was acquired by Grab in 2017 while Payfazz has a valuation of  over US$100 million . 
 Wongsoredjo, however, says that his company is targeting a different market. While Payfazz, Kudo, and Mitra Bukalapak usually enlist  warung pulsa  or phone credit stalls, Super focuses on  warung kopi  – small eateries or restaurants – and micro convenience stores. 
 Super is even working with Payfazz to offer its own reseller network the ability to process bill payment and phone credit purchases, giving them more livelihood opportunities. 
 Efficient logistics 
 Traditional ecommerce players in Indonesia have partnered with logistics companies or built their own systems to deliver orders as soon as possible at affordable rates. 
 But traditional ecommerce logistics goes from door to door, so the delivery fees can become expensive. For example, when a customer who lives in the Greater Jakarta area buys Indomie noodles from its official store on Tokopedia, the delivery charge is almost half of the product’s price. 
 
  Tokopedia’s checkout page indicates that the cheapest delivery fee (40,000 rupiah) is almost half of the product’s price (93,120 rupiah). 
 
 In comparison, social commerce startups say that by pooling orders and sending them in bulk to their agents, who then distribute the goods to end customers, they can increase logistics efficiency. This model can also cut costs, adds the senior executive from a regional logistics firm. 
 But if the startups deliver the products directly from a warehouse to the end customer, “there will be no difference in logistics cost compared to traditional ecommerce,” he says. 
 Another reason why social commerce startups can have this efficiency is because they usually only offer limited SKUs or SKUs with similar proportions. In contrast, traditional ecommerce companies sell all sorts of products, so they sometimes need to send a refrigerator – big size – and a bag of frozen food – a small item that needs special preparation – to the same area.

  Logistics is another area where social commerce diverges from traditional ecommerce.  
 Wongsoredjo decided to take the order-pooling approach after realizing social commerce startups in India find it challenging to hit average order value (AOV) because they facilitate every single order to the end users. 
 “Indonesia has a smaller economy compared to India, and the gross domestic product per capita of our Tier 2 and 3 cities and rural areas is relatively small. If we do the same, we will have a hard time making our business profitable,” Super’s CEO explains. 
 Some social commerce startups have also set up their own logistics hubs in locations near their agents – a strategy that they say can push logistics costs below 1% for every product. 
 Chilibeli, for example, has a warehouse in the Greater Jakarta area and says that it will add more when the business and communities grow. Super, on the other hand, often teams up with stall owners who have small warehouses to boost its logistics capabilities. 
 However, there is a caveat: Pooling orders means longer lead times before products can be sent out. 
 Wongsoredjo says that this may be a problem for customers in big cities, but not for those in rural areas. “For them, the most important aspect is the product’s price, not the delivery time,” he points out. 
 Choosing the right products 
 For social commerce startups, choosing the right product is essential because they need to have access to the manufacturers to get cheaper prices. On the other hand, the products they select must generate a high volume of transactions so they can keep ordering in bulk. It’s also important to have hyperlocal product availability, according to Wongsoredjo. 
 In general, this is the general cost structure of a social commerce product: 
  
 
  Cost of goods sold for manufacturers  
  80% to 85%  
 
 
  Commission for agents  
  5% to 10%  
 
 
  For social commerce firms  
  10%  
 
  
 Social commerce startups allocate the profits from each transaction to logistics, operational, and marketing expenses. 
 To increase profits, Super plans to release white-label products or goods that it repackages with its own brand and logo. The startup can gain a gross margin of 25% to 30% from every transaction involving such merchandise, Wongsoredjo says. 
 In the last decade, traditional ecommerce players have succeeded in pushing online transactions, especially for tech-savvy consumers. But the low digital literacy of most people in rural areas means they have been excluded from the online ecosystem. 
 “That’s why social commerce can’t work in the United States, where people’s digital literacy is high. It’s a similar situation in China, where you can aggregate orders online without offline agents’ presence. But not in Indonesia, where most of the people who live outside Jakarta are not savvy about doing online transactions,” Wongsoredjo says.

646224,Covid-19 presents an opportunity for banks to go fully digital," The Covid-19 pandemic is forecast to shrink the global economy by  as much as 6%  in 2020, and as cities stay in lockdown, the numbers are unlikely to get better. 
 Despite this, the current situation could present an opportunity for financial institutions to make the leap and go digital – even though banks are tightening their belts and putting tech investments on the back burner.

 “To drive change during a crisis is a very difficult call. During these difficult times, you’re going to see some changes [in banking] emerge, and some [banks] are unfortunately going to go down,” says Tan Bin Ru, the CEO of OneConnect – an associate of China’s Ping An Insurance Group – in Southeast Asia. 
 OneConnect provides technological applications and technology-enabled business services to financial institutions. These include digital onboarding solutions such as enabling companies to conduct the electronic know-your-customer (eKYC) process via facial recognition and biometric authentication. Originating  unsecured loans  for the unbanked, an area that traditional banks typically steer away from due to difficulties in ascertaining their credit worthiness, is another solution the company has adapted for its Southeast Asian clients. 
 Some banks, like India’s Kotak Mahindra Bank, have taken a different approach and are going 100% digital, Tan says. 
 In March, the Mumbai-headquartered bank extended its digital account opening platform to its corporate customers as part of the  enhanced initiatives  its enacting during the country-wide lockdown. It also implemented a bilingual voice bot named Keya which can tackle customer queries in both English and Hindi. 
 Rocking the boat 
 Over the last two years, New York-listed OneConnect has turned its attention toward Southeast Asia as the region’s financial sector picks up the pace in digital transformation. Tan says the company aims for the region to eventually make up 10% of its total revenue. 
 Digital onboarding, which employs technologies such as facial recognition and biometric authentication, was a particularly hot category for the firm in 2019, and Tan expects this will continue into 2020 thanks to government-led efforts in the region. 
 As an example, Thailand’s central bank has given its  stamp of approval  for six lenders, including Kasikornbank, Bangkok Bank, and Siam Commercial Bank, to use eKYC technology to verify the identity of customers who are opening online deposit accounts. 
 OneConnect is currently working with major financial institutions in Malaysia and Thailand, as well as KBIJ, a private credit bureau in Indonesia, and UBX, which is a subsidiary of UnionBank in the Philippines. While it hasn’t partnered with major banks in Singapore yet, Tan foresees that will soon change, as she says talks with players in the city-state are becoming “more regular.” 
 However, “Singapore banks are, unfortunately, relatively comfortable,” she notes.

 An industry analyst agrees. “There’s a certain element of market structure and a lack of competition that’s preventing the competitive drivers that we should see to push [Singapore] banks to move beyond their complacent stage,” Zennon Kapron, the director of financial technology research and consulting firm Kapronasia, tells  Tech in Asia.  
 With the pandemic, though, Tan predicts that the demand for these digital solutions – such as those enabling bank accounts to be opened remotely – will increase as banks become more conscious about cutting costs. With many bank branches shut, OneConnect has gotten “a lot of inquiries” on such solutions, Tan adds. 
 Targeting digital banks 
 New digital banks, many of which are looking to serve unbanked segments, have been more receptive to OneConnect’s solutions. 
 In March, the company became the  technology partner of the Beyond consortium , which is gunning for a full digital banking license in Singapore. OneConnect will help the digital bank with its end-to-end technology stack if the consortium is granted the licence. The company plans to pursue similar partnerships in the region. 
 While OneConnect had initially considered applying for its own digital banking license in Singapore, there was some pushback from its clients in Malaysia. “It was a known thing that if you applied [for a license] in Singapore, you’d also apply in Malaysia. We would be deemed as a competitor to many of our clients,” Tan explains. 
 But it’s a different story in Hong Kong, where OneConnect runs its own virtual bank. Apart from boosting its presence in the Greater Bay Area, the soon-to-launch Ping An OneConnect Bank was also a chance for the company to test out its own technologies before selling them to its Southeast Asian clients.

 These insights could prove crucial, given the parallels between Hong Kong and Singapore – both are major trade hubs where many import and export-focused small and medium-sized enterprises operate. The two cities are also home to a big underserved pool of foreign workers and expats and have a similar domestic market size. 
 Challenging times ahead 
 The combined impact of the pandemic and the earlier protests in Hong Kong has delayed the launch of Ping An OneConnect Bank in the city. But the outbreak’s effect has gone further than that. 
 OneConnect was planning to launch its localized insurance solutions in Southeast Asia on a broader scale this year, but that’s likely to roll out at a slower pace in the current economic slowdown. “The full impact on the top line – opening up a new revenue stream, potentially taking on some innovations to leapfrog [our] competitors – I foresee those will halt for the whole year,” Tan notes. 
 Despite a strong start in the first quarter of 2020, the company’s momentum has slowed, as financial institutions cut back IT spending. 
 But there’s a silver lining: The firm’s digital solutions might be exactly what incumbents need during this crisis. 
 With the Monetary Authority of Singapore  delaying the results  of successful digital bank applicants till the second half of this year, digital banking in the city-state will no doubt have a slower start. 
 Unlike incumbent banks, who’ve been around for a long time and are well-equipped to survive the downturn, “it’s going to be the first test of crisis for the new digital banks and fintech companies,” says Tan.

 We first  heard the buzz about a potential Honestbee scoop  around a year ago. Our chief correspondent Terence – who was still editor-in-chief back then – told me that we have insider information about Honestbee’s financials and inner workings. 
 The newsroom was ready to dig deep and investigate. But truth be told, I was worried that while we were putting the story together, any misstep – whether valid or not – could cause us trouble. The society we live in favors the rich and powerful, after all. 
 We pursued it anyway because that’s the core duty of journalists. We engaged lawyers and other professionals to advise us on what we can or cannot print. We probed and unearthed as much info as we could, and we believe that we’ve been fair. Actually, you can be the judge of that – catch all of our Honestbee stories  here . 
 Our latest piece is an  exclusive interview with Brian Koo , a scion of the family that controls South Korean electronics giant LG. As a key investor in Honestbee, he was able to give a unique perspective and in-depth insights into what it was like working with ex-CEO Joel Sng. 
 
  Joel Sng’s name card for “Sun Group Capital” 
 
 Sng’s rise and fall is a cautionary tale for founders, a clear illustration of what can happen when you take the mantra of “fake it until you make it” way too far. 
 And while we believe doing a good job is its own reward, we always  appreciate kind feedback  from the community.  Tech in Asia  will remain fearless and vigilant so that we can continue to deliver high-quality journalism to this part of the world. 
 Thank you for the lessons, Honestbee. But I think it’s also important to note that the troubled company isn’t representative of Southeast Asia’s tech community. The majority of the people in this industry  have a good heart .

646158,Ninja Van raises $279m in series D funding,"  Ninja Van , a leading ecommerce logistics company in Southeast Asia, said it has raised US$279 million in new funding in its series D round. 
 The round was led by existing investor GeoPost, a European logistics major, alongside two sovereign wealth funds, the startup said in a statement. It was earlier reported that Zamrud, Brunei’s state fund, has taken a significant stake in the company.

 Other investors include US VC firm Carmenta Capital Management, Thai telco Intouch Holdings, Singapore’s Golden Gate Ventures Growth Fund, and ride-hailing giant Grab. Existing backers like B Capital, the VC firm created by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, and Monk’s Hill Ventures have also made further investments. 
 According to Ninja Van CEO Lai Chang Wen, the new funds would enable the company to further strengthen its core express logistics business in Southeast Asia. It also plans to deepen its foray into the business-to-business sector. 
 The funding comes amid a crucial period for the ecommerce industry, which has proven resilient amid Covid-19 compared to other sectors like travel. The pandemic has slowed down ecommerce supply chains and has led to increased demand for certain shopping categories while simultaneously  hurting others . 
 “Thankfully, Ninja Van is not badly affected by this,” Lai previously said in  an interview . “Yes, our costs have gone up. Yes, productivity has gone down significantly. But online shopping is going to grow.” 
 Ecommerce logistics remains competitive in Southeast Asia. In Indonesia alone, Ninja Van competes with players like JNE, J&amp;T Express, and many others. 
 Besides its domestic delivery service, Ninja Van also runs Ninja Direct, which helps online sellers source, purchase, ship, and finance wholesale products. It has launched a B2B logistics arm in Malaysia as well.

646160,Major layoffs at prominent digital lending firm Oriente," The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the online lending industry hard. While more people and businesses are seeking loans to make up for lost income, online lenders are seeing defaults spike and slowing down the issuing of new loans. 
 As a result, these lenders are making drastic moves to survive. In Southeast Asia, startups like  Akulaku  and  Funding Societies  had to lay off employees to keep their businesses running. Oriente, a prominent and well-funded online lending firm started by a co-founder of Skype, isn’t spared either.

 The company tells  Tech in Asia  that it has retrenched a little over 20% of its employees since Q4 of 2019. However, three sources within the firm say that about half of over 2,000 employees will be let go by the first half of this year. 
 The ongoing cuts, which have been carried out in waves, sweep across its offices in Shanghai, Taipei, Hong Kong, Singapore, Jakarta, and Manila. Its office in Changsha, China, is being shut down. 
 Oriente’s spokesperson says that not all of the layoffs had to do with Covid-19. Some sales staff were made redundant as a result of technology. 
 On whether more layoffs are on the way, he adds that due to the uncertainty around the crisis, the company expects more changes in the coming months and has planned for different scenarios. “We hope for the best, but we must plan for the worst,” the spokesperson says. 
 Cash shortage 
 Employees tell us that they are unhappy at how the retrenchments have been conducted. “We feel we have not been treated right by HR and the co-founders,” one source says. 
 The company told affected workers that because of limited resources, it’s asking them to forgo the salary owed to them unless they sign a release agreement to shorten the notice period or accept lesser amounts than what’s stipulated in their employment contracts. They add that the company isn’t forking out severance payments. 
 The company’s spokesperson denies these claims. “All settlements are determined based on local employment laws and contractual obligations, which are fully honored,” he says, “Our priority has been to make sure those who are impacted are fully supported.” 
 “All employees are aligned with our revised corporate strategy and united in our efforts to get through this crisis,” he adds. 
 Regardless,  Tech in Asia  understands that a top management executive has said in an internal meeting in April that the company expects that some employees won’t sign the release agreements and may even air their grievances with labor tribunals. 
 However, the spokesman says all affected staff have signed the agreements. 
 Oriente has been delaying salary payments amid Covid-19. Because of the lockdowns in various cities, it has been unable to run loan issuance and collection, which it primarily does in physical locations like malls and shops, sources say. 
 The spokesperson reveals that the company has furloughed some of its employees. Founders will not take any pay for the rest of the year, while the entire senior management team will take a 30 to 50% pay cut. 
 Caught by surprise 
 The layoffs, and the way it was done, have caught some retrenched employees off-guard. The company seemed well-funded: It announced  a series A raise of US$105 million  in November 2018. Among its backers are prominent retail conglomerates like Philippines’ JG Summit, Indonesia’s Sinar Mas Group, and Malaysia’s Berjaya Group. 
 Communications from management have not been forthcoming. “No one in the company bothered to address the employees on the mass terminations,” a source says. Laid off staff were told the news during one-to-one meetings. 
 The spokesman responds, “Because it’s an ongoing process [since Q4 2019], there is no internal communication broadcasted to all employees.” 
 What added to the confusion was how Oriente couldn’t offer better retrenchment benefits despite recently announced the raising of  US$50 million  as part of an “ongoing series B round.” Employees are doubting if all of that money is new – after all, the fundraising for the round has been happening since last year. 
 The spokesman replies: “We have been extremely fortunate to have secured additional funding recently from new and existing investors.” 
 The money will be used to mitigate anticipated headwinds on liquidity, and to demonstrate the company’s potential to “overcome and outperform the market in a recession.”

 Despite having offices in several countries, Oriente’s main operations are in Indonesia and the Philippines, where it operates with the brand name Finmas and Cashalo respectively. Both countries have implemented lockdown or social restriction procedures due to Covid-19. 
 Recently, Oriente has started to operate in Vietnam with the brand name Finizi. However, sources said that the service is still in beta, and it only has around 25 employees there. Offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore were used as developer and data science centers.

646136,Vietnamese staffing platform for blue-collar workers shifts gears to weather Covid-19," As the former head of operations for Tiki, one of Vietnam’s largest ecommerce marketplaces, Phan Xuan Canh encountered major difficulties when he had to hire hundreds of shift-based temporary workers for the company’s warehouse and events. Typically, this type of enlistment was handled by staffing agencies or Tiki’s own human resources department, involving lengthy spreadsheets containing the contact information of people who might take up these gigs. 
 Canh saw an opportunity to build a tech-enabled platform that is similar to Uber Works, which was launched in October 2019 and described by  TechCrunch  as a platform that matches shift workers with shifts. Beyond Tiki’s case, there was a good reason for Canh’s vision to come into being. In Vietnam, the demand for temporary work is extremely high, as a major part of the labor force constitutes what is known as the informal economy.

  A winning proposition  
 Canh left Tiki in 2017 to serve as the fulfillment project director for GHN, a parcel delivery service that is part of logistics firm Scommerce, which last year  raised US$100 million  in a round led by Singapore’s Temasek. Canh’s experience at GHN again showed him the need for a platform that enables efficient, quick, and large-scale hiring for temporary blue-collar workers who form the foundation of fulfillment centers. 
 In 2018, the core team for  Viec.co  was formed. It included co-founder and chief technology officer Nguyen Son Tung, who was previously the head of technology for Tiki and chief technology officer for bus ticketing platform Vexere. 
 “Similar to Uber Works, we wanted to build an on-demand staffing platform, which is different from a typical job listing or job matching site,” Canh said. “Clients can just fill out their hiring request on our platform, and Viec.co will handle the rest, from recruitment to hiring paperwork to provide training.” 
 Since the workers are hired for shift-based tasks, Viec.co’s automation frees up HR and recruitment resources that were once tied down by repetitive processes. Additionally, conventional staffing agencies typically prefer clients whose staffing demands do not fluctuate constantly, so Viec.co is able to fill the gap, according to Canh. 
 Viec.co applies technology to authenticate and vet qualified workers at a massive scale, relieving the burden of maintaining large rosters of staff, particularly if turnover is frequent. The firm’s clients benefit from real-time shift schedule management and automated payroll, similar to how drivers get paid when they offer services on ride-hailing platforms such as Grab. Workers can also upload their profiles to be matched with staffing requests in the future. 
 Viec.co claims that its clients include some of the biggest ecommerce players in the country, such as Tiki, Shopee, and Lazada. With the booming demand for ecommerce and logistics services in Vietnam, Viec.co said the platform has recorded a monthly growth rate of 30%, with 40,000 freelance workers from 24 provinces using the platform. 
 Last year, Viec.co was crowned as the winner of Vietnam Startup 2019, a competition organized by the popular online news portal  VnExpress  with the theme “Unicorn to be.” Viec.co has also raised money from angel investors, investors from Shark Tank Vietnam, as well as early-stage investment firm Access Ventures. 
  When the going gets tough, the tough gets going  
 Canh knows well that Viec.co is nowhere near attaining unicorn status, especially with the Covid-19 pandemic affecting businesses over the world, including Southeast Asia. Now, for the startup and the workers who rely on the platform to earn a living, it’s about survival. In times of crisis, temporary workers are vulnerable. The Vietnamese government estimates that at least 5 million workers in the country have lost their jobs as of mid-April due to Covid-19. 
 The startup is considering a strategy shift by focusing on partnerships with staffing agencies, specifically those that can benefit from Viec.co’s platform and scale up employment for temporary workers. 
 “I believe there’s still a growing demand for hiring flexible workers, especially as Covid-19 has forced many companies to rethink how they use existing resources,” Canh said. “At this time of crisis, we want to focus on ensuring that our tech can further accommodate our existing and future B2B clients, anticipating that hiring demand will soon return.”

 “There is a lot of uncertainty as to the depth and duration of the pandemic and we don’t know how long the economic recession will last. We are taking active steps to conserve cash and manage our employee base,” Grab told  Tech in Asia  in an email statement. 
 The company said it has opened up the options to teams across the region with “excess capacity.” Employees can take them on a voluntary basis. 
 Andrew Chan, Grab Singapore’s head of transport, also said in a letter Wednesday that the company might no longer be able to provide drivers with extra financial support if the city-state decides to extend its circuit breaker restrictions beyond June 1. Grab previously said it would be spending US$40 million on relief initiatives in Southeast Asia for affected driver- and merchant-partners. 
 “No one can be sure how long the situation will last, but we are preparing for a long and difficult path ahead,” Chan was quoted as saying in the letter by  Today . “As our revenues continue to fall, senior Grab leaders have taken a  pay cut of up to 20% , and Grab staff have also been encouraged to take no-pay leave voluntarily.” 
 According to a recent survey by insurance firm Aon, 21% of companies in Singapore have considered voluntary and involuntary pay cuts to help weather Covid-19’s financial impact. 
 Grab’s CEO and founder Anthony Tan said in a letter last week that the company will be making “ tough decisions and trade-offs ” as it evaluates the pandemic’s impact on the business. 
 He noted that Grab has seen a sharp decline in its ride-hailing segment in cities and countries that have imposed major lockdowns. 
 In Singapore, the government has asked people to stay home as much as possible until June 1 this year. The measure prohibits any outside activity except buying food and daily essentials and attending to urgent medical needs. 
 Lockdowns like these have also been imposed in a number of Grab’s other markets, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand. 
 Grab’s delivery business, however, has been faring better, Tan said, as stay-at-home measures worldwide boost demand for online food and grocery deliveries. ",Miguel Cordon,1,2,"[(2, 0.99963826)]",['Aon'],"['Singapore', 'Asia', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia']"
646123,Learn how to pivot your product in a pandemic,"

646103,Here’s how tech is solving construction’s biggest problem," The common perception of the construction industry is that it’s low tech: people in hard hats, heavy machinery, site plans printed on paper. 
 In a world that relies heavily on technology, the building and construction sector has  lagged behind  in tech adoption. 
 As such, it has had one of the lowest labor productivity growth rates over the last 20 years – the biggest challenge in the industry. 
  Over 98%  of construction megaprojects like expressways and bridges face cost overruns or delays, and concerns about project interruptions cause other problems on site, such as  safety breaches . 
 As companies rush to meet their deadlines, safety precautions may get sacrificed. In Singapore, for instance,  35% of workplace fatalities in the first half of 2019  were from the construction industry. 
 There are various other reasons for construction delays as well, ranging from major miscommunication to minor paperwork errors. 
 Tackling the problem with tech 
 One company that’s looking to not only solve the construction industry’s productivity woes but also help digitize it is  Novade . 
 Founded in 2014, the Singapore-based company offers field management software for construction sites in an aim to drive the digital transformation of the industry. 
 “If you go to an automated car factory, you will see robots and automated processes as well as computers providing real-time information on production outputs and quality controls,” says Novade founder and CEO Denis Branthonne. “The construction industry is not there yet.”

 Novade’s ambition is to become the virtual factory for the construction industry. 
 Its platform takes a mobile-first approach to field management, making its services available over smartphones. Users can easily file and access all the necessary paperwork for a construction site through the Novade app. 
 By moving paperwork processes online, the company is helping construction companies become more productive. 
 For example, workers are required to fill up a permit-to-work (PTW) form before they can operate machinery at high structures or do hot work. “It’s a very intensive administrative process for compliance,” Branthonne explains. 
 Through Novade’s platform, employees can fill up the forms via their mobile phones, and site supervisors and safety officers can review them on their devices without having to sift through piles of paperwork. 
 This service has helped boost productivity for companies such as Hwa Seng Builder, a Singaporean civil engineering firm. By using Novade’s software, it has reduced the time spent on processing PTW forms each day from two hours to just 30 minutes. 
 The software has also made it possible for Hong Kong construction company Able Engineering Holdings to make its construction sites safer. Site managers can immediately see what kinds of PTW forms have been filed and thus step up safety precautions accordingly. 
 For example, if a manager sees many hot-work permits filed for the week, they can conduct additional checks to ensure that safety requirements are met. 
 The company has also launched an offering to help construction companies adopt new health and safety measures, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, by automating daily body temperature capture and recording employees’ contact history, to name a few. 
 AI in construction 
 Aside from boosting productivity, Branthonne hopes that Novade will be able to provide companies with better insights into their processes with its use of data analytics and machine learning. 
 Through the startup’s platform, companies can look at data from across their sites and identify various trends, such as top performers among workers and recurring problems. Data can also be used to streamline the decision-making process.

 “Imagine a quality inspector finding a crack in the wall during an inspection and [then planning] to get it rectified in 15 days,” explains Branthonne. “AI algorithms can analyze existing data and predict with a high level of accuracy that only 10 days are required.” 
 The app also notifies subcontractors about defects immediately. This drives productivity on construction sites by speeding up timelines and makes work progress more quickly. 
 The CEO believes that AI can even help make construction sites safer by identifying factors that lead to accidents. 
 “AI will be able to predict the likelihood of a safety incident onsite based on data collected, not just from the current project but also across all projects,” he says. “If it senses an increase in safety risks, it can broadcast a message to stop operations and initiate investigations.” 
 Novade is working towards developing the machine-learning capabilities of its platform even further. The company recently closed a series B funding round and aims to use the investment to enhance its AI capabilities and leverage on the vast quantity of data it has amassed across construction sites over the years. 
 The road to digitization 
 With construction facing new challenges in the form of an  ageing workforce  and  rapid urbanization  across the world, going digital would boost productivity in the sector tremendously. 
 However, getting companies on board with digitization is no easy task. 
 The construction industry is fragmented, and construction projects involve various subcontractors, all of whom operate on their own systems. 
 “You’re not alone,” explains Branthonne. “When you decide to go on the path [to digitization], you’re going to have to convince not only your teams, but everybody on the project.” 
 Additionally, many large companies have multiple projects at the same time. Embarking on digitization is a slow process that involves aligning teams over months, even years. 
 The hardest part, according to the CEO, is getting started. Businesses need to understand their own processes and figure out how to convert them to work in an online environment. 
 For companies looking to go digital, Branthonne advises to start simple. 
 “Identify a repetitive process and prove that the software helps manage that process efficiently. Then replicate the digitized process to another project and, finally, to the whole company. Over time, the results will speak for themselves,” he says. 
 
 Headquartered in Singapore, Novade offers a field management software that empowers construction firms to embark on a digital transformation for their construction sites.

645983,"Cutting marketing cost may seem smart during Covid-19, but data tells a different story","  This article was co-authored by Raja Ramachandran.  
 The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a lot of uncertainty for professionals out there – and marketers are no exception. As companies attempt to balance advertising budgets with resiliency plans, it’s easy to think that every dollar spent by a chief marketing officer is one less dollar the CEO has in the bank for weathering the storm. However, uncertainty is no excuse for poor business decisions.

 I’ve heard from a number of marketers recently – from companies of every size and stage – that they’ve been instructed by their leadership teams to cut brand marketing spend. 
 If you’re a startup that has to make cuts in order to meet payroll, I get it – this piece does not apply to you. But if your decision is driven by fear of the unknown or some risk avoidance strategy, I’ll give you a few historical examples and data points on why this might not be the best for your business. 
 Lessons from global crises 
 A decade before the Great Depression, another worldwide economic recession had unfurled, stemming from the conclusion of the First World War. The Depression of 1920, as it’s often called, happened in an economy that was rapidly globalizing, where advertising and media were becoming much more important for businesses. 
 In his published work,  “The Use of Advertising During the Depression ,” author Roland Vaile followed both the revenues and magazine marketing spend of 230 companies from 1920 to 1924. According to his findings, firms that had increased their marketing spend grew their revenues much faster than those that did not. 
 His research also found that during the recession, businesses that had boosted their advertising spend received a smaller blow to their relative sales. These companies grew revenue past the study baseline about a year earlier than their peers and outpaced them in the recovery years that followed. 
 More recently, Peter Field, a research fellow at the B2B Institute, published a fascinating study on how advertisers had reacted to the global financial crisis and how their reactions affected their companies’ long-term prospects. 
 Field’s research concluded that those who have the resources and means have little reason not to take advantage of the moment and accelerate their brand’s share of voice (SOV). 
 Defined as the percentage of advertising within a category owned by a brand, SOV is heavily correlated with market share. Cutting brand marketing spend and lowering SOV have short-term cost benefits, but data shows that growth may otherwise be more expensive in the recovery period. 
 Field provides some practical insights and applications in his piece, which can be read in its entirety  here . 
 Clear-eyed assessment 
 For companies to understand their next moves, teams must know where their businesses sit within the market. 
 Do they make an essential product with high demand, but supply chain disruptions are affecting their ability to deliver (e.g., a grocery supplier or producer of personal protective equipment)? Are they selling a complimentary product with higher demand than usual and are also less reliant on supply chains (e.g., a video-streaming app)? Or are they in a discretionary spending category and in need of reserving cash to simply stay in business (e.g., an airline)? 
 For those in the first category, it makes little sense to continue with customer acquisition marketing since they can’t fulfill much of their consumers’ orders. Instead, the companies can use the budget allocated for acquisition to build brand empathy. For example, telling stories about how they’re helping businesses in their vertical during this difficult time can put them in a better position to pounce once supply chains reopen. 
 This may also be wise for those in the second group. Cost per conversion has been plummeting due to increased media consumption and budget pullbacks, so there’s no better time to reallocate those savings to grow brand value and leapfrog the competition. 
 For those in the last category, it may make sense to cull marketing spend – not because it’s good for business, but because they have no other option. For those that do have a choice, they should be thinking long term. 
 Progressive vs. defensive 
 When in crisis, businesses tend to act defensively out of concern over losses and risks. But this reaction influences firms to do more of the same thing even when there are fewer resources, instead of focusing on efficiency and innovation. 
 In 2000, for example, Sony rolled out company-wide cost-cutting measures, including reducing marketing spend. While the move increased its profit margins from 8% to 12%, its sales tumbled from 11% to 1%, and Sony struggled to regain the momentum. 
 In contrast, South Korean conglomerate Samsung went on an offensive during the Great Recession of the late 2000s. It aggressively increased research and development investments and marketing costs as well as hired senior marketing executives from big brands like L’Oreal. 
 At a time when its rivals were paring down their projects, Samsung used the vacuum to its advantage by rebranding itself as an innovative company. This helped catapult its flagship Galaxy smartphone brand in 2009 and compete head on with Apple. Later on, Samsung became the  19th most valuable global brand . 
 This is not to say that companies should spend indiscriminately. Instead, they should be selectively defensive in cutting costs and, at the same time, continue to make strategic investments that nurture growth. 
 Another tactic used to grow revenue is optimizing marketing mix – in short, doing more with the same or fewer resources. This allows firms to manage the ongoing crisis, leverage opportunities in these times, and rebound when the economy normalizes. 
 Focus on core brands 
 Whenever a crisis hits, companies are sometimes required to make an urgent pivot in their marketing strategies. For a brand that deals with many different product lines, for instance, it would be wiser to pool marketing resources and focus on the one that is likely to survive. 
 In  Tech in Asia ’s case, we had different marketing strategies and corresponding budgets for our different lines of business. Because of the ongoing pandemic, our premium jobs subscription has taken a hit. With many companies in our target segment freezing new hires, it would not be practical to continue investing in paid marketing channels. 
 At the same time, we saw an increase in news consumption, as businesses try to access information that would help them navigate this critical time. Hence, it was a good opportunity for us to increase our spend and promote our premium news subscription to reach and engage as many potential customers as possible. 
 Onward to recovery 
 The International Monetary Fund expects the pandemic-caused recession to  partially recover by 2021 . While this isn’t guaranteed, it’s a clear sign companies shouldn’t cut down their mid- and long-term goals just yet. This is particularly true for business-to-business marketers, whose sales cycles are relatively longer. 
 Ultimately, unless your company’s very survival depends on it, there’s very little data showing that panicked pullbacks in brand spend are justifiable. At the very least, you should be strategizing to maintain your market share and hopefully even grow it.

645843,Online furniture retailers turn to AR to reach consumers amid the pandemic," As people continue to stay home amid the Covid-19 pandemic, retailers such as online furniture shop  Castlery  are turning to augmented reality (AR) to bring the shopping experience to consumers.

 Founded in 2013, the Singapore-based startup designs and produces modern furniture at competitive price points. It does so by cutting out the middleman and keeping inventory lean, passing the savings to its consumers. 
 It just launched an AR-powered app that allows users to view true-to-scale products and examine details such as fabric and leather textures in a real-life environment. Users can also visualize how the designs will look in their space before they make a purchase. 
 The app, which is only available for iOS devices at the moment, was initially scheduled for release in Q3 2020, but was accelerated in light of the current crisis. 
 “Like everyone, our business and operations have been materially affected by these rapidly shifting circumstances,” Declan Ee, co-founder of Castlery, tells  Tech in Asia . “As shoppers are unable to physically experience our products, it is crucial that we provide them with a viable digital solution.” 
 The startup hopes that its AR app can eventually drive a 10% to 15% improvement on its digital checkout share. 
 AR, however, isn’t new to the home design scene. There are similar efforts by other furniture players like Singapore-based Commune, which launched a  new mobile app  prior to the pandemic. International brand Ikea also has its own AR-based app, Ikea Place, which it rolled out in 2017. It also recently  acquired  an AR startup to help attract shoppers despite the lockdowns. 
 Indonesia’s Fabelio aims to introduce its own ecommerce app later in the year and add an AR feature as well. 
 It has also been working on a virtual tour feature that lets shoppers visit Fabelio’s 20+ showrooms without having to step outside, co-founder and chief product officer Filippo Lombardi tells  Tech in Asia.  The startup aims to roll it out in the next couple of months. 
 Ee believes that consumers will soon become comfortable with a fully digital shopping experience. He notes that if the movement restrictions stay in place, consumer behavior may shift towards a more “low-touch” environment. 
 “Consumer habits are hard to change,” he says. “But given the current circumstances, they have no choice, so adoption could increase during this period.”

 According to a report from Digi-Capital, the AR market can potentially have a 2.5 billion active install base to generate  US$60 billion  in revenue by 2024, up from US$8 billion in 2019. This is despite the economic impact brought by Covid-19. 
 Market intelligence company Research And Markets also said recently that AR is a key sector that can potentially see more growth opportunities during the pandemic. 
 It’s not just retailers that can benefit from the technology. The  healthcare sector , for example, can also use AR to simulate surgery, improve diagnostic imaging, and enhance patient care. Korea’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety recently announced that it plans to expedite the approvals of new medical devices based on AR as well as virtual reality to help in its fight against the novel coronavirus. 
 AR can also have an impact on the education sector. For example, medical students at Case Western Reserve University in the US are using an AR app, HoloAnatomy, to learn about the human body from their homes. 
 Although AR somehow provides a way out for retailers and other industries, businesses – especially those currently facing cash flow issues – should think carefully before integrating the technology into their products and services, Ee says. 
 “It has to be a cost/benefit analysis, and every business is different,” he observes, adding that integrating AR can be worth the investment if it truly improves the customer experience. It should also show up in the numbers, improving online conversion and boosting return on investment by 5% to 10%. 
 “But, of course, not if the company is facing serious short-term cash flow issues,” Ee warns. “That is definitely more important over and above anything in the immediate six to nine months.” ",Miguel Cordon,0,3,"[(0, 0.7070759), (3, 0.29279897)]","['app', 'AR', 'Commune', 'Castlery', 'HoloAnatomy', 'Ikea']","['US', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'Fabelio', 'Tech', 'Indonesia', 'Korea', 'Jakarta']"
646041,Why is Facebook betting $5.7b on Reliance?," Facebook’s venture with Indian oil-to-gas conglomerate Reliance could turn out to be instrumental to its plan to capture the country’s vast retail market and serve as a template for Southeast Asia or any region it hopes to enter. 
  Tech in Asia  spoke to people involved in the deal and industry experts to understand what may have prompted the social media giant to make its biggest acquisition since  buying WhatsApp in 2014  for US$22 billion. 
 Facebook  paid  US$5.7 billion for a little less than 10% of Reliance’s digital assets, which include its telecommunications unit Jio and e-wallet JioMoney as well as music and video-streaming services. The deal values Reliance’s October 2019 carve-out at US$66 billion.

 Global tech majors like Facebook, Amazon and Google are hoping that India’s volumes will make up for the relatively low disposable income in the world’s  largest digital economy  outside China. 
 With its formidable local tech giants and restrictive controls on foreign businesses, China can be a tricky or even a no-go market for international companies, particularly US firms. Facebook head honcho Mark Zuckerberg’s relationship with the Middle Kingdom has hit a  nadir  despite making several  overtures , including learning Mandarin. 
 “India is a special country for us,” said Facebook when it announced the deal with Reliance. It wants to “enable new opportunities for businesses of all sizes,” especially the over 60 million small businesses across the country, the social network added. 
   
 “Payments have always been the tip of the spear,” says Vijay Mani, a partner at professional services network Deloitte India. That’s why controlling the flow of money at  kiranas  – the mom and pop shops that dominate India’s unorganized retail industry – will help them sell other services. Facebook and Reliance will likely offer ecommerce as well as lending and financial services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), he adds. They also plan to leverage Reliance’s existing payment terminals with  kiranas , a person familiar with the companies’ thinking tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Through its grocery shopping app JioMart, Reliance has been trying to  make inroads  by subsidizing the cost of these terminals and waiving transaction fees. The company  piloted  JioMart in January to connect neighborhood  kiranas  with millions of Reliance Jio users.

 The goal is for merchants to deepen their relationship with Reliance and use it to order supplies, finance working capital, and borrow money, the source says. 
 From Reliance’s perspective, the deal could dramatically increase its potential reach and give it access to Facebook’s deep pockets, according to the source and some analysts. 
 WhatsApp will help almost 30 million  kiranas  take digital payments, said Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, in a video message following the Facebook deal. “This means all of you can order and get faster delivery of day-to-day items from nearby local shops,” he added. 
 Three days after the announcement, JioMart allowed customers to place orders from local grocers in three Mumbai neighborhoods. From order to delivery, all transaction-related communication  takes place on WhatsApp  – an approach that could come in handy for users as India is under a nationwide lockdown. 
 Connecting with friends 
 Facebook’s earlier attempt to tackle payments in India on its own had hit a stumbling block. The country’s regulators  delayed  the rollout of WhatsApp’s  payment service  over concerns about storing data locally, among others. Even though WhatsApp said it had  complied with guidelines , the service hasn’t been offered widely and is limited to its initial 1 million users. 
 “We’re also working beyond India in a number of other countries and hope to have this rolled out to a large percent of the people who use WhatsApp within the next year,” Zuckerberg told analysts in a June 2019 call. One of those countries is Indonesia, where Facebook plans to team up with local firms to launch its  payments service . 
 However, Facebook still has to overcome regulatory hurdles in each market. In India, for example, Reliance has long been known for its ability to work around local regulations. This has helped Jio upend India’s crowded and cutthroat telecoms industry, emerging as the leading player by number of users in just a over three years. 
 Yet Facebook’s India head  has denied  that the Reliance deal is aimed at sidestepping the Indian government’s increased scrutiny of WhatsApp. 
 Reliance is expected to help its 380 million users transact on WhatsApp using its in-house wallet JioPay, the source adds. But the company and Facebook  didn’t clarify  what would happen on these fronts. 
 Almost all of Jio’s mobile users are authorized using their unique government-issue identity number, and this has helped with meeting know-your-customer regulations. These rules, which are relatively new in India, have adversely affected JioPay rivals Paytm and Amazon Pay as they did not have the infrastructure needed to verify existing and new users. Most Amazon Pay users, for example, are asked to verify their identity to continue using their digital wallets.

 It is likely that Alphabet Inc.’s stunning success in India was on Zuckerberg’s mind, says Jayanth Kolla, the Bangalore-based founder of research firm Convergence Catalyst. Though Google Play doesn’t contribute much to the search giant’s revenue, it is the toughest competition for the Facebook-Reliance venture, he notes. 
 Google Pay became the world’s most downloaded financial technology app as of December 2019,  according  to SensorTower. Within two years after its launch, Google Pay  had  67 million active users in India. It processed more than 2.5 billion transactions with an annual transaction value of over US$110 billion in the country. 
 Google Pay hitched a ride on India’s Unified Payments Interface, which was rolled out in 2016. By 2025, digital transactions in India could be worth US$1 trillion annually, with four out of every five transactions being made digitally, Google said in a report. 
 In September 2019, Alphabet unveiled Google Pay for Business. The platform allows  kiranas  to accept digital payments and  host  digital storefronts on Google Pay. 
 Other US tech giants aren’t sitting idly by. Just a day after the Facebook-Reliance announcement, Amazon  introduced  a program to connect  kiranas  to their customers in the neighborhood.

 Facebook’s investment comes as Reliance boss Mukesh Ambani tries to reduce the company’s debt, which piled up as it spent  approximately US$50 billion  to roll out cheap mobile internet. 
 Reliance’s net debt  was at  about US$20 billion, Ambani told shareholders in August 2019. Costs to finance that debt then had more than doubled from a year earlier. 
 Before the Facebook announcement, investors were increasingly apprehensive about Ambani’s promise to turn Reliance debt-free by March 2021. Petroleum and gas titan Saudi Aramco’s  proposed investment  has been delayed in the wake of falling oil prices. 
 On March 23, Reliance’s stock was in decline, falling to a 20-month low as the Covid-19 pandemic threatened business. Respite only came after news reports of a potential deal with Facebook. The recovery in the share price also put Ambani back on the throne as Asia’s  richest man . 
 A finger on the till 
 Reliance’s attempts to steer the flow of money at SMEs is not going unchallenged. 
 India’s HDFC Bank is the market leader in processing merchant payments. Every third transaction is done either through s cards or one of its payment options. 
 Facing competition from the likes of Google Pay and Paytm, HDFC recently had a tie-up with tech firm Innoviti to enable its terminals to accept digital payments. The bank has more than 400,000 of such devices, which are used by 300,000 merchants across India. 
 Innoviti and HDFC – the country’s second-largest bank – are using this extensive reach to lucratively lend to SMEs, retail consultants say. 
 At present, lending rates are high for  kiranas  in the absence of proper bookkeeping and daily cash flow records, but access to such data would help tech majors to offer more affordable loans, analysts and bankers observe. For instance, Innoviti already has a highly profitable  lending business . This could mean the difference between turning profits and burning cash to dominate payment terminals. 
 Reliance’s strategy so far has been to provide payment terminals to  kiranas  and other SMEs at steep discounts and to forego fees. The hope is that its collaboration with State Bank of India – the country’s biggest – would eventually augment such spending. 
 “Multiple businesses could be built with this partnership,” notes Deloitte’s Mani, including ecommerce, financial services, and solutions for SMEs. 
 While Reliance  has dismissed  speculation that it wants to become super app like Grab, WeChat and Alipay, some analysts believe that its partnership with Facebook will help both companies tap into India’s growing ecommerce scene. 
 The nationwide lockdown has forced everyone to order online, and the billions of dollars invested by Walmart-backed Flipkart, Amazon, and other players have brought about a change in consumer habits. 
 “Reliance let everyone else do the heavy lifting when it came to changing user behavior,” points out Santosh Pai, a partner at Link Legal India, which advises Chinese clients on Indian investments. “It’s now coming in to reap the benefits.” ",Kenan Machado,0,7,"[(0, 0.69213957), (1, 0.30780146)]","['Alphabet', 'Reliance', 'Facebook', 'SensorTower', 'Innoviti', 'WhatsApp', 'Amazon', 'JioMart', 'Flipkart', 'Google', 'Paytm']","['US', 'Mumbai', 'Asia', 'Bangalore', 'JioPay', 'India', 'Paytm', 'Indonesia', 'China']"
645959,Banning Zoom isn’t the answer to countering cyberattacks," A few weeks ago, the Singapore government decided to suspend the use of the video conferencing app Zoom after internet pranksters hijacked an online geography lesson for secondary school students. The Ministry of Education has  since resumed  its use with new safeguards in place for users. 
 “Zoombombing,” as the cyberattack trend is called, has become a real issue over the past few weeks due to Zoom’s sudden popularity, which has eclipsed Microsoft’s Skype and Teams platforms, Google’s Meet, Cisco’s Webex, Citrix’s GoToMeeting, and others. 
 
  Photo credit:  Visuals  
 
 The thing is, those other platforms aren’t necessarily any more secure than Zoom, and therefore aren’t a panacea for those wishing to find an “unhackable” video conferencing service. 
 On March 20, Zoom CEO Eric S. Yuan  published a blog post  on how to keep uninvited guests out of events and meetings, and how the company was shifting its engineering resources “to focus on our biggest trust, safety, and privacy issues.” 
 So with the firm  putting security measures in place  days and weeks ago, why are breaches like Zoombombing still happening? 
 Issue 1: The lack of education and cyberhygiene 
 Each Zoom meeting uses nine to 11 digits in its meeting ID, so attackers have simply been using apps and similar services to guess valid meeting IDs at the rate of 100 IDs per second. Doing back-of-the-envelope calculations, we can see that it would take them only a few minutes to stumble across meetings in progress. 
 With passwords still not mandatory for all Zoom users to enter chats, hackers and pranksters can easily find meetings to break into and disrupt. 
 ID hacking apps can be found online easily enough; even unsophisticated users can try their hand at digital trolling. 
 But the biggest problem lies in the fact that meeting hosts themselves aren’t following – or don’t even know of – Zoom’s new recommendations on security. 
 These include locking meetings with passwords, knowing how to remove unwanted or disruptive participants, automatically muting microphones and cameras when participants join, getting members to join a waiting room first before being permitted into a meeting, turning off file transfer, setting up private chats, and more. 
 Issue 2: Updating Zoom clients in a timely manner 
 With 200 million users on Zoom, it’s become more difficult for the platform to issue updates to its software. The company can’t simply invite all of its users to update at the same time. Otherwise, the equivalent of a distributed denial of service attack would occur and overwhelm Zoom’s servers. 
 This is the same issue that Apple, Microsoft, and others face when issuing updates. It’s a problem of scale that every company must manage to ensure their customers are always using the latest, most secure versions of their services. 
 Issue 3: Enterprise IT support availability in the age of Covid-19 
 While individual users can update software as needed, usually after receiving an update notification or when they check manually, not all enterprise customers can do this. 
 Normally, IT departments regulate these updates so that rogue versions don’t cause incompatibility surprises and take workers offline – something much harder to deal with when an employee is working remotely. 
 Issue 4: “Super user” malware 
 This is the issue of malware that can potentially take over Zoom sessions in progress and infect the actual Zoom session and client. The malware could then send additional viruses to other participants, leak data, and more, all through an infected Zoom client. 
 The same type of attack could take place over other video conferencing programs. While there are only proof-of-concept attacks at this stage, these could be easily weaponized and replicated by sophisticated attackers. 
 What is the solution? 
 Protecting digital workloads has become both critical and more complex, becoming a basic human need that is just as important as the others. 
 The apps and services we use offer us unique security measures, and it’s up to us to be responsible for activating these options. When builders put a lock on the front and back doors of a house, for instance, it is still up to the homeowners to use those locks to secure their property. 
 Zoom’s advice on meeting security is absolutely essential for every meeting host, participant, teacher, student, government department, and user to know, implement, and insist on. 
 If you are able to join a Zoom meeting without a password, it’s because your host didn’t make this measure mandatory. Setting passwords is now an absolutely essential action, as are all of Zoom’s recommendations. 
 The company has also published a series of excellent  videos and tutorials  on managing participants in a meeting, which are vital for all hosts to learn about and implement. 
 Educate yourself on a services’ available security features and always address the five vectors of cyber protection: safety, accessibility, privacy, authenticity, and security. This is the only way to maintain control in our new digital reality. 
 Recommendations 
 That being said, Zoom – like other video conferencing services – has its own part to play: 
 
 The company should consider increasing the length of meeting IDs from the current nine to 11 digits to a longer 12 to 15 digits as a precaution, and force the use of passwords in all scenarios. Yes, this will make meeting IDs longer to type in for dial-in phone participants, but it will also make Zoombombing harder for hackers and pranksters. 
 Updates can be installed promptly by increasing server capacity. Users of outdated versions should be kept from joining meetings until updates are installed. 
 Developers need to make security their absolute priority and not sacrifice it for convenience. 
 Security and cyberprotection software must be used – those that not only warn of unpatched operating systems and software but also actively protect against unpatched vulnerabilities.

646052,JD reportedly files for $2b Hong Kong listing," Chinese ecommerce giant JD.com has confidentially filed for a secondary listing in Hong Kong,  Bloomberg  reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 
 The listing, which might help the company raise at least US$2 billion, could come as early as the second half of the year, one of the sources said. The size of the deal, however, has yet to be decided because details are still in discussion.

 According to  Bloomberg , JD.com’s potential Hong Kong listing could narrow its gap in market value with global peers like Amazon and Alibaba. The Beijing-based company, which is listed on Nasdaq, is valued at around  US$64 billion . 
 The report comes as global businesses are negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. However,  Bloomberg  noted that JD.com is still seeing increased demand from smaller Chinese cities. Its model, based on direct-to-customer sales and in-house logistics, may lead to a better performance than its peers that connect merchants with customers, said the report. 
 Late last year, Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group raised  US$12.9 billion  in its secondary listing in Hong Kong. Alibaba went to the US in 2014 for its initial public offering because Hong Kong didn’t allow dual-class shares at the time. 
 In 2018, Hong Kong relaxed its policy and allowed dual-class shares to attract tech companies. Earlier this year,  JD.com , search engine Baidu, online travel agency Ctrip, and internet giant NetEase were said to be considering a secondary listing in the country.

 Founded in 2014, Conicle provides businesses with an all-in-one learning solution to help develop and re-skill their workers through its learning management system (LMS). Its technology takes a data-driven approach to learning, personalizing content to each user. 
 With the new funds, it plans to expand its presence in the international education market. It also looks to invest further in product development to better capitalize on Thailand’s 1 billion baht (US$30 million) LMS market and 10 billion baht (US$300 million) corporate training industry. 
 Within the next three to five years, Conicle looks to move from just being a learning platform to becoming a “people development ecosystem,” aiming to get its clients and partners more involved in the learning process, said its CEO and co-founder Poon Nakorn. 
 “In terms of growth, we aim to become a regional tech company that helps organizations in the Southeast Asia region, which is a region of great growth and clear demands in terms of workforce development,” Nakorn added. So far, the startup has over 500,000 users from more than 30 companies, including AIA Group, PTT Group, Makro, and Honda. 
 According to Stormbreaker Venture managing director Janatanarak Tuekaew, the global LMS market is growing at 19.9% a year and is set to hit a size of US$18.8 billion by 2024, with Southeast Asia taking a US$1.5 billion slice.

 Founded in late 2017, Vonder develops microlearning solutions by converting “hard-to-digest and boring content” into short, gamified lessons. These can then be used for the education sector or staff training via Line, Facebook, and other platforms. 
 For corporates, HR staff can create their own content using Vonder. Alternatively, the startup can help them co-create or convert existing content into Vonder’s microlearning format. 
 It also offers a chatbot to help answer employee’s questions as well as a feature that allows HR staff to survey employees in a gamified way. 
 With the investment, Vonder looks to further penetrate the business-to-business corporate training market for corporates as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. It also plans to develop new products. 
 The company claims that it was profitable for the first year of operation and has been constantly growing month over month. It aims to grow by 3x in order to raise series A money in the next 12 months, according to a statement. 
 “Vonder was started by two friends wanting to have fun creating a product for students to use. We did not think that from the fun that originated the idea from day one, that Vonder will grow into a business with a constantly increasing user base,” Shin Wangkaewhiran, co-founder of Vonder, shared. 
 Although the Covid-19 outreak is negatively impacting businesses globally, Vonder also sees it as a sign of growth for edtech as education shifts online. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(0, 0.58803177), (2, 0.2592664), (3, 0.15251651)]","['Promaid', 'Vonder', 'Facebook']",['Thailand']
645985,Indonesian financial management app BukuKas raises seed funding," Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) form the backbone of Indonesia’s economy, accounting for about  60% of the country’s gross domestic product . Most of these small businesses, however, still track their financial activities with pen and paper, which can lead to inefficiencies and lost profits. 
 To help solve this, two former Lazada employees launched  BukuKas , a financial management app that provides simple bookkeeping solutions for Indonesian MSMEs.

 Founded in December last year by Krishnan Menon and Lorenzo Peracchione, BukuKas helps small businesses understand and manage their financial flows more effectively through a digital ledger that can be accessed on their smartphones. Since many neighborhood stores let people buy using credit, the app also allows business owners to send WhatsApp reminders to customers when credit is due. 
 Menon and Peracchione met at Lazada Indonesia in 2012. Back then, Menon was onboarding merchants to the ecommerce platform, while Peracchione was leading Lazada’s buying ops. 
 Now, their venture BukuKas just raised an undisclosed amount of  seed funding from Surge , Sequoia India’s Southeast Asia- and India-focused accelerator, to expand the capabilities of its app. Credit Saison, Hustle Fund, Whiteboard Capital, 500 Startups, and several angel investors also participated in the round, according to a statement. 
 BukuKas plans to use the new funds to offer neo-banking services. The company also recently announced a  collaboration  with insurtech startup Qoala, which recently raised  US$13.5 million  in its series A round, to provide affordable insurance products to its users. 
 BukuKas said that its app is currently being used by a wide range of industries, including fashion, food and beverage, electronics, and phone credit. 
 The startup also claims that from the start of the year through March, it has seen a 20x growth in users and a 60x increase in transactions. As of April, BukuKas said it serves over 250,000 merchants, recording more than US$150 million worth of transactions.

645935,Wavemaker backs diving-focused online travel agency in $1m seed round," Even though scuba diving travel in Asia alone is valued at US$4.5 billion, it’s not typically served by large online travel agencies. This is why travel startup  ZuBlu  wanted to focus on this niche.    
The Hong Kong-based startup just announced that it has secured US$1 million in a seed funding round led by early-stage venture capital firm Wavemaker Partners. Mana Impact, She1K, and strategic angel investors also participated in the round.

 The experience-driven sector is underserved and fragmented due to the complexity of putting together marine experiences as well as finding resorts and operators. ZuBlu’s platform allows people to do all these “at the click of a button,” as the company put it. 
 ZuBlu was built in 2017 by Adam Broadbent and Matthew Oldfield to help people search, compare, and book scuba diving activities and underwater adventure travel, in general, with a focus on Asia. 
 With the investment, the company plans to improve the user experience of its platform and expand its resort portfolio and experience offerings. Part of the new funds will go towards increasing its marketing outreach to educate, inform, and inspire its audience. 
 The company also looks to cater to all those who are seeking underwater adventure travel, including snorkelers, freedivers, and surfers, ZuBlu told  Tech in Asia . 
 In spite of the impact of Covid-19 on the travel sector, ZuBlu said that it has grown its resort partner network and member community by 46% and 425% respectively this year. The founders are also optimistic about the rise of travel in the post-outbreak era. 
 “Scuba diving and underwater adventure travel – in particular, to remote destinations that are home to incredible experiences – are uniquely positioned to flourish in a post-coronavirus market,” said Broadbent. 
 According to ZuBlu, 90% of the 1,000 people it surveyed in the diving community said that they hope to book their next trip within a month after travel restrictions get lifted. 
 ZuBlu is not alone in this niche market. Other players include Singapore-based Divegraphy, Taiwan-based DeepBlu, and Swiss company Diviac, among others. 
 Prior to its seed round, the startup was part of the fourth cohort of Betatron, a Hong Kong-based startup investor and accelerator. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(1, 0.26713765), (2, 0.73258054)]","['Diviac', 'ZuBlu', 'Divegraphy', 'DeepBlu']","['Asia', 'Taiwan', 'Singapore', 'Betatron']"
645955,“The best companies get created in tough times”," Dear readers, 
  Tech in Asia  has been reaching out to the startup and venture capital community in recent weeks to find  positive vibes  amid the ill effects of Covid-19 on people’s health as well as the economic and business environment. 
 Yet some companies remain optimistic as we struggle to find our way through this pandemic. 
 For instance, Sequoia Capital India is  open for business , despite the doom and gloom of Covid-19. It continues to invest because it believes that “the best companies get created in the tough times,” Abheek Anand, a Singapore-based managing director at the VC firm, tells  Tech in Asia .

 One such company is  Alibaba . 
 Back in 2001, Alibaba was a loss-making yellow pages startup. Jack Ma and his co-founders Joe Tsai and Savio Kwan managed to reduce the company’s costs to US$500,000 per month from US$2 million and bought it a runway of 18 months, allowing them to figure out a new business model. 
 Pivoting to become a cross-border business-to-business listing platform helped the company survive SARS in 2003. Today, Alibaba is among the world’s biggest tech companies, with a market capitalization that stands at  US$564 billion . 
 Let’s remain optimistic during this crisis, which will eventually pass.

645591,The pandemic is the perfect storm for the rise of Malaysian e-wallets," Nothing has been as disruptive as the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 As of this writing, over 1.5 million Covid-19 cases have been confirmed in more than 190 countries across the globe. Some 86,700 deaths have been attributed to the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the outbreak has also placed billions of people on lockdown.

 Earlier in January, to encourage the use of e-wallets, the Malaysian government had partnered with three e-wallet providers to disburse 450 million Malaysian ringgit among 15 million eligible citizens. With the country currently under an extended lockdown, this move seems like a model for more government-led digital stimulus packages for keeping the economy afloat. 
 The current state of Malaysian e-wallet use 
 While Malaysian e-wallets have slipped under the radar recently, the underlying figures are robust. 
 The average value per transaction in e-money, for instance, has quietly breached the 10 ringgit ceiling, even reaching 11.69 ringgit in January 2020, based on the latest statistics from Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM). 
 This is a significant improvement, as the average transaction value had not passed 5 ringgit since 2005, the year the country’s central bank BNM liberalized its policies, allowing nonbanking institutions to issue e-money. 
 For the government’s current digital stimulus package, 47 e-wallet players threw their hats into the ring, but only three were chosen – GrabPay, Boost, and Touch ‘n Go – which could be a verdict on the industry’s winners. 
 E-wallets prevail with mobile commerce 
 Covid-19 has forced consumer behavior to change on a massive scale, and it’s causing a surge in digital consumption across the board – from mobile commerce and online food delivery services to digital content production. 
 Case in point: 1.3 million Malaysians tuned into the Lazada Birthday Carnival in March. There is also a sudden rise in new TikTok users in the country. 
 Since all nonessential stores are closed and many people opt to stay at home to avoid potential infection, mobile commerce and e-wallets have become frontrunners. 
 One digital payments player that’s reaping the benefits is TNG Digital, which has strong backing from China’s Ant Financial and CIMB Group. 
 With 10 million registered users – 50% of them active on its Touch ‘n Go e-wallet platform – TNG Digital is well-positioned through its strategic partnership with Lazada. 
 While desktop-driven internet banking is common, mobile commerce has undergone quick growth in recent years, and the outbreak could serve as a pivotal point for its rise. This is especially true in Malaysia, where the population is connected to mobile internet for approximately four hours a day, making it one of the top 10 countries in the world for mobile internet usage. 
 Nouveau retail after the outbreak 
 In theory, online stores of all sizes stand to benefit from the switch in consumer behavior. However, ecommerce is not a one-size-fits-all option, as there are many other retail services that are difficult to digitize, such as petrol stations. 
 Malaysians have an average of two cars per household. That equates to almost nine car owners out of every 10 citizens, turning high-traffic petrol stations into potential breeding grounds for infection. 
 These new challenges put Setel, a Malaysian petrol e-payment solution, in a unique position. Its contactless pay-in-car system had already gathered over 1 million users in just a month after its January 2020 launch, and the company has no intention to limit itself to the petrol category. 
 “[Our] next phase would be to allow the adoption of Setel in other convenience stores since our core strategy is to provide a seamless retail-on-the-go experience,” says CEO Iskandar Ezzahuddin. The team is already working on a drive-through convenience store concept, where customers can select and pay for items as they leave petrol stations. 
 With 1,000 gas stations across the nation acting as distribution channels, Setel could pioneer Malaysia’s “new retail” revolution, pushing other e-wallets to replicate similar offerings across the spectrum. 
 Post-pandemic travel life (or the lack of it) 
 The 2020 e-Conomy SEA 2019 report by Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company had predicted that the Southeast Asian internet economy could reach US$300 billion by 2025. That may no longer be the case, as online travel was expected to contribute US$78 billion to that figure. 
 Barring the possibility of online travel recovering to its pre-pandemic level, the outbreak has left e-wallets in the industry with two possible outcomes. 
 If travel makes a strong comeback, cold hard cash could still transfer diseases and magnify the spread of viruses, so having an on-the-go, multicurrency payment option such as BigPay or GrabPay would better serve travelers’ needs. 
 In the event that the online travel category turns even more sluggish, there are still millions of migrant workers who would require ecommerce services, as remittance costs remain expensive across Southeast Asia. In January, for instance, Malaysian fintech player Tranglo announced a partnership with WeChat Pay to enable its users to perform wallet-to-bank transfers in Indonesia and the Philippines. 
 E-wallets with such services would not only tap into the traveler market but also minimize exposure costs for millions of migrant workers in the region. 
 Outward remittances from Malaysia grew significantly by 23.3% year on year to US$9.7 billion in 2018, according to data from BNM. 
 The game-changing digital banking license 
 Covid-19 has exposed Malaysia’s ill-equipped and aging banking industry. While the country’s banks waited for BNM to announce relief measures, local e-wallet player Boost rolled out a 150 million ringgit cash fund to provide immediate assistance to the 135,000 micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises on its platform that were facing financial difficulties. 
 This could prove to be a watershed moment, with e-wallets building stronger relationships to support their users and merchants. These players have also proven to be highly effective at dispersing money as part of the Malaysian digital stimulus package, with more than 10 million ringgit redeemed on the first day alone. 
 In short, a prolonged pandemic, coupled with more digital stimulus packages from the government, would inevitably favor nimble e-wallet companies who are willing to go the extra mile. 
 Covid-19 will be the ultimate stress test for all companies, more so for startups that were already experiencing volatility pre-pandemic. But e-wallets with distinct value propositions will increasingly gain solid ground, creating a perfect ecosystem that attracts startups trying to stay afloat.

 Founded by Bandung Institute of Technology students, Eduka builds a platform where learners can practice problem-solving for multiple subjects. After completing a problem, students can also evaluate their results and compare them with those of other participants. 
 The startup’s CEO Ahmad Faiz Sahupala, who still attends classes at Bandung Institute of Technology, said that many students focus only on memorizing theories and give less attention to their application. 
 “Therefore, we want to unlock their potential by giving high-order thinking skills (HOTS) exercises that are applicable and related to daily life, so they can get used to facing complex problems as well,” the chief exec said. 
 Currently, Eduka says it has more than 800,000 users practicing on its platform, which is accessed by about 180,000 students every month. 
 “Education is a huge space, and we believe Eduka can make a better impact [on] Indonesia’s education system,” said Init 6’s Zaky. 
 Init 6 is an early-stage startup fund that looks for technical founders with a passion to solve big problems. Bukalapak co-founder and former chief technology officer Nugroho Herucahyono (also known as Xinuc) has joined the fund as a partner. 
 Zaky announced his  exit as Bukalapak CEO  late last year. He continues to support the ecommerce giant as an advisor while establishing the Achmad Zaky Foundation, which aims to bolster Indonesia’s tech ecosystem through education and entrepreneurship development.

645859,Zilingo’s layoffs expose internal fault lines," As the alcohol started flowing at Zilingo’s year-end party, employees witnessed the co-founders file out of the warehouse and head to the clubs – along with a select group. 
 While insignificant on its own, the incident fed into the disgruntlement that some staff were feeling toward the Singapore-headquartered firm. Their grouse? Systemic favoritism. 
 “It’s blatant,” says a staff member who declined to be named. Favored team members receive promotions or opportunities to work on more important projects regardless of merit, he claims, adding that “the unwanted work will be left over for the rest.” 
 
  The Zilingo team / Photo credit: Zilingo 
 
 Everything came to a head last week. The young firm, which has gone from zero to almost a billion US dollars in value within half a decade, made headlines after it  laid off 5%  of its staff or about 45 of its 900-strong global headcount. 
 Sources, however, said the number of affected employees is higher. Those affected include people in Europe, Indonesia, as well as the company’s just-shuttered US and Australia offices. 
 The news in itself isn’t surprising. As investors tighten their purse strings amid Covid-19, many internet startups are shedding staff just to survive. Zilingo’s layoffs, however, stood out: Affected workers have  lamented to the media  about how the exercise had been mismanaged and how the majority of those affected in the Singapore headquarters were locals. 
 This was one of the toughest decisions we’ve had to take. 
 Other issues are at play as well. While Zilingo has impressed topflight investors like Sequoia Capital and Temasek with its blistering growth figures, employees raised questions about whether the numbers could be maintained. 
 In response to  Tech in Asia’s  detailed list of questions, the company issued a statement: “Last week, we executed an organizational restructuring to focus on our core business in Asia. This meant that we had some redundancies and had to let some of our beloved colleagues go. 
 This was one of the toughest decisions we’ve had to take as a leadership team. We are very sorry to see some of our most hardworking people leave us.” 
 We reached out to four of Zilingo’s investors, and none of them were able to comment. 
 Sinking morale 
 For three of the employees that  Tech in Asia  spoke to, the way the layoffs were done fueled their misgivings. They question why certain colleagues were kept while others were let go and allege that the startup didn’t provide post-retrenchment support. 
 “Understandably, some of our colleagues are very upset and even angry with us. Each of the affected employees is being spoken to one on one to answer their questions and concerns,” Zilingo’s statement read. 
 “Noncompete clauses have been rightly waived while we’re working hard to ensure they are placed well by creating a roster with professional details, reference letters, and tapping into our own networks,” it continued. 
 
  Photo credit: Zilingo 
 
 And yet, employees feel that the layoffs showed a lack of communication from the top – an issue that had become a trend at the firm. The cuts in Singapore came as a complete surprise, as it seemed like business as usual before that. Some employees only found out about the layoffs through  The Business Times , which first reported about it. 
 In Zilingo’s Australia and United States offices, which are shutting down, morale hit rock bottom as employees worried if they would be let go. Anxious managers waited for instructions from headquarters, which was not forthcoming at first. 
 Employees say they’ve also received conflicting information about the reason behind the layoffs. While they were initially told that the exercise had nothing to do with Covid-19, a follow-up message that was sent to staff seemed to contradict that. 
 “As the world returns back to normal, we hope that someday we’ll once again have the privilege of having you back,” part of the message read. 
 A cause of these apparent missteps appear to be the insularity of the young founding team. Decisions were often made overnight without consulting the heads of departments. Some senior hires – hailing from banks or tech giants – were often kept out of meetings or discussions, causing a few of them to quit after short stints. 
 As a whole, Zilingo moves at a breakneck pace. “The mindset is always to launch things as fast as possible,” a source says. 
   
 After raising a  US$226 million round  in February 2019, its headcount doubled to 900 in about a year. It changed directions a number of times since its launch in 2015 – from a fashion shopping site to a marketplace and services firm for fashion wholesalers, and now a software firm for fashion-focused manufacturers. 
 The startup is “turning out to be a very ARR-ish (annual recurring revenue) business in the long run,” said Zilingo chief operating officer Aadi Vaidya in a previous interview two months ago. 
 At the same time, although it ostensibly focuses on fashion, its wholesale shopping site,  Zilingo Trade , stocks home, beauty, and food products as well. 
 In October last year, the company announced a  US$100 million push  into the US, only to say last week that it would focus on Asia and emerging markets instead. 
 There’s a lot of things we’re not tracking. 
 While rapid decisions are par for the course among startups, sources feel these moves could’ve been exercised with more care. 
 Accounting processes have not kept pace with the growing size of the organization, an employee notes, saying, “There’s a lot of things we’re not tracking.” Colleagues had to scramble to put numbers together whenever there was a request. 
 Meanwhile, Zilingo’s CEO, Ankiti Bose, rarely addresses the whole company, sources point out. Major decisions, instead of being announced, were filtered down from one colleague to the next, sowing doubt among staff about whether the startup had a true “north star.” 
 “We had big plans to launch in the US. We wanted to hire around 100 people. Overnight, it was cut to half. Two weeks later, there was a hiring freeze,” an employee says. 
 Team members had to pick up the pieces. Budgets could be cut at the last minute, a source claims, causing them to make awkward calls to unhappy vendors who had to cancel a project that they’d invested time into. 
 Can it sustain its growth? 
 As Covid-19 ravages the global economy, it’s likely that Zilingo’s business has been hit. While certain ecommerce categories are thriving,  fashion sales have suffered . Usage of Southeast Asian-focused fashion retailers like Pomelo and Zalora have declined, according to web and mobile app activity estimates seen by  Tech in Asia . 
 It doesn’t help that many fashion e-tailers also run physical shops, which are sitting ducks in a lockdown. Waning consumer spending is hurting the very supply chain that Zilingo is trying to improve, which means its own bottom line will be affected. 
 While sources close to Zilingo said that it was reaching US$2 billion in annualized gross merchandise volume and capturing a tenth of that as revenue, the company may face a tough time matching or surpassing these figures even if there was no Covid-19. 
 COO Vaidya noted two months ago that the company works with over 6,500 manufacturers and 70,000 sellers on its platform. Between 200 to 300 factories are paying for its freemium software, and about half of its seller base are active on a quarterly basis in some way.

 As the software business is still nascent, most of its transactions come from business-to-business sales, Vaidya and various sources confirm. These purchases mostly occur through the Zilingo Trade website, its software for factories and sellers, or manual order taking. 
 But here’s the issue. A person familiar with the company’s performance says that the retention of these sellers has not met expectations. Sources add that on the factory side, only a fraction of them have an active relationship with Zilingo. 
 While the company has used promo codes to entice sellers to try the platform, they often drop off after the discounts run out. 
 Zilingo is still trying to address this problem. “It’s a long journey,” the person says. 
 After cancelling its expansion into the Western markets, it has bought more time to get things right.

645797,Sequoia-backed insurtech startup Qoala nets $13.5m in series A round," With a large growing middle class in need of more security in their financial planning, there is immense potential for the insurance sector to take off in Indonesia, said Kenneth Li, the managing partner at Centauri Fund. 
 This is why the US$150 million investment firm, a joint venture between South Korea’s KB Financial Group and Indonesia’s Telkom Indonesia, has made its first investment today by leading a US$13.5 million series A round for  Qoala , a startup that wants to make filing insurance claims as simple as ordering a pizza.

 Sequoia Capital India, Flourish Ventures, Mirae Asset Venture Investment, Kookmin Bank Investments, and Mirae Asset Sekuritas have joined the funding round, according to a statement. Existing investors MassMutual Ventures Southeast Asia, MDI Ventures, Surge, SeedPlus, and Bank Central Asia’s Central Capital Ventura also participated. 
 Qoala is a Jakarta-based startup founded in 2018 that provides a multichannel insurance solution. It works with large-scale platforms to drive awareness about insurance – a product that has low penetration in Indonesia. At the same time, it helps traditional insurance channels, which contribute 99% of insurance premiums, to go digital through its app.

 Tommy Martin, the co-founder of Qoala, said that the company will use the new funds to invest further into technology, its brand, and the team, which it plans to double to 300 over the next year. 
 Qoala has also created new offerings “to provide payouts to those affected by the pandemic, including those who have had their treatment partially or fully subsidized by the government and are hence ineligible per usual insurance plans,” Martin said. The new initiative will be available on a larger scale within the next four weeks, shared the co-founder. 
 Last year, the startup raised  US$1.5 million  in seed money from Sequoia Capital India’s Surge. It says it currently processes over 2 million policies per month, up from 7,000 in the past year, serving industries covering travel, fintech, consumables, logistics, and employee benefits.

 The investment, which bumps up the company’s total capital raised so far to US$18 million, was led by Saison Capital, according to a statement. It also included participation from existing investor East Ventures as well as new backers Access Ventures and multifamily office Lamivoie, among others. 
 Helicap said the new capital provides it with a significant cash runway to move forward with its business expansion plans, which include enhancing its proprietary credit scoring technology and exploring further solutions in the private debt space. 
 “By bolstering our balance sheet, Helicap is well-positioned to weather the current economic storm,” said David Wang, the CEO and co-founder of Helicap. 
 Wang also said that the company’s series A raise comes after it registered its fund management subsidiary, Helicap Investments, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. This allows it to conduct regulated fund management activities with up to 30 accredited and institutional investors and S$250 million of assets under management. 
 Less than a year ago, Helicap also obtained a capital markets services license for dealing in capital markets products through its  acquisition  of Arcor Capital, a lending firm that focuses on private debt and growth capital for early-stage firms in Asia. 
 In addition to the investment, Helicap also announced that Kosuke Mori, the managing director for Credit Saison Asia Pacific and the managing partner at Saison Capital, has joined its board of directors. This follows Helicap’s recent appointment of Akbar Habibie, chairman of Indonesia’s Bank Muamalat, as special advisor to the board.

 The Hong Kong-based company said it plans to use the new funds to fuel growth in its existing markets and drive expansion into new ones, including Vietnam. It also looks to invest more in its technology infrastructure, product suites, and big-data capabilities. 
 In the coming months, Oriente said it will be committed to deploying its resources, infrastructure, and network as economies worldwide start to rebound following the pandemic-led economic slowdown. 
 Using technologies such as AI, machine learning, and data science, Oriente offers real-time credit scoring, digital credit, offline-to-online consumer finance, point-of-sale financing, as well as working capital financing for microentrepreneurs. 
 Last year, the company claims to have seen a 700% year-on-year increase in transactions and says it’s serving more than 4 million new clients. Right now, it currently boasts over 5 million users and more than 1,000 merchants with its two app-based ventures: Cashalo in the Philippines and Finmas in Indonesia. 
 “Southeast Asia’s vastly underserved merchant-consumer ecosystem has tremendous economic potential, and we are excited to power a more capable financial services infrastructure that is purpose-built to unlock this,” said Oriente co-founder Geoffrey Prentice. 
 Prentice, who is the co-founder and former chief strategy officer at Skype, founded Oriente in 2017 with BlackPine Private Equity founder Lawrence Chu and former LU.com founding chief technology officer Hubert Tai. 
 Just last month, the startup announced that it had secured  US$20 million  in debt funding from multiasset investment company Silverhorn Group. According to Oriente, it aims to grow its loan book with the new facility, which can increase to at most US$50 million. 
 In 2018, it banked  US$105 million  in series A money from Malaysia’s Berjaya Group, the Philippines’ JG Summit Holdings, and Indonesia’s Sinar Mas, among others.

 Launched in March 2019, Tigerhall is a success enablement startup that connects people to Asia’s influential leaders via in-person events or digital content. Through its app, the startup provides bite-sized content that covers insights, experiences, successes, and lessons from what it calls “Thinkfluencers.” For personal experiences, Tigerhall arranges private dinners, exclusive lunches, group mentorship sessions, or the like with Thinkfluencers for its users.

645604,Rocket Internet-backed Tinvio bags $5.6m in seed money," Many small and medium-sized merchants today still manage orders with their suppliers through email or phone calls, and invoices and payments continue to be exchanged largely in paper. These make operations very tedious for these business owners, in addition to their lack of access to financing and credit scoring. 
  Tinvio , an early-stage startup backed by Rocket Internet, digitizes these interactions through its communication and commerce platform that is designed to increase business efficiency and profitability.

 Tinvio provides a chat-to-order mobile experience that enables users to send messages and orders more easily. The app also generates a digital ledger of all orders, invoices, and issues for real-time monitoring and analysis. 
 The Singapore-based company said it has secured S$8 million (US$5.6 million) in seed funding to invest in product development and market expansion. The round was led by Sequoia Capital’s accelerator Surge, with Global Founders Capital and Partech Partners as participating investors. 
 Ajay Gopal, Tinvio’s founder and CEO, told  Tech in Asia  that the startup plans to add more features such as financial services, workflow integrations, and analytics in the next 12 months. It also plans to enter Australia, Taiwan, and other major cities in Southeast Asia, as well as add support in more languages. Right now, Tinvio has a presence in 10 cities, including Hong Kong. 
 Gopal founded Tinvio in July 2019 after working with Rocket Internet and serving as a fintech investment banker at Credit Suisse. The startup disclosed that it has grown its customer base to over 1,000 businesses in the last six months, with 50% monthly user growth, 80% cohort retention, and an annualized gross merchandise value of S$50 million (US$35 million). 
 Amid the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, Tinvio said it has launched a number of initiatives to support local businesses, including the  Save Our Nomnoms  movement that helps raise awareness for Singapore’s food and beverage brands. It will also continue to invest capital to help businesses go digital during the crisis.

 Established in 1989, Growthwell is a one-stop, meat-free solutions provider for food and beverage organizations. It provides plant-based food alternatives as well as logistics support and customer service. The company said the fresh cash infusion will allow it to accelerate its growth in developing alternative proteins and future food solutions. 
 Part of its growth plans is to set up a tech center in Singapore by Q1 2021 to focus on the research and development of plant proteins. According to a statement, the facility will be equipped with foodtech applications, moisture extrusion capabilities, and an automatic manufacturing production line to scale production in the region. 
 Justin Chou, executive director at Growthwell Group, said that the company aims to capitalize on the growing global demand for plant-based alternatives to meat and seafood. According to market research firm Arizton, the plant-based protein market around the world is expected to grow by approximately 9% yearly starting 2020 to reach over US$7 billion in revenue by 2025. The Asian market, however, remains largely untapped. 
 “The recent Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the vulnerabilities of our food supply chains. Our decision to build a manufacturing facility in Singapore is a timely solution to tackle the food security issue,” Chou said. 
 The company also said that part of the new funds will go towards its commitment to a “significant stake” in Israeli foodtech startup ChickP. However, it didn’t disclose any financial details. 
 Under the collaboration, the two companies will develop plant proteins and launch a 90% chickpea protein isolate specially designed for plant-based dairy and meat alternatives. Growthwell is also currently developing chickpea protein-based alternatives to seafood that would be free of allergens, gluten, lactose, and hormones. 
 The Singaporean company aims to expand the distribution of ChickP products across key Asia-Pacific markets such as China and Australia. It will also develop new product offerings, such as chickpea-based milk and ice cream, in 2021. 
 It has selected Country Foods as its main distribution partner, according to the statement. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(3, 0.99965876)]","['Arizton', 'Growthwell']","['Australia', 'Singapore', 'China', 'Brandify']"

645800,How Singapore’s rooftop gardeners are filling the food supply chain gap," As urban consumers, we tend to take it for granted that we’ll always have fruits and vegetables at our disposal in markets, groceries and other stores. But as governments across the world are implementing measures to curb the spread of Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, experts warn that we’re also  running out of staples . 
 And yet even as food is becoming scarce, wastage is getting rife. With lockdowns forcing farm workers to stay home, tonnes of produce have been  left to rot  without ever reaching markets. 
 But what if those of us who live in the concrete jungles could grow our own food and eat them, too?

 Singaporean startup  ComCrop  has developed a  hydroponic farming  system that allows crops to be cultivated on top of buildings – plenty of sunshine, no soil required. This could be helpful in a land-scarce country that currently imports  around 90%  of its food supply and has plans to produce  30% of its own “nutritional needs” by 2030 . 
 Using its tech on a commercial scale, ComCrop produces 50 kilograms of leafy greens every day to supply supermarkets in the city-state. Founder Peter Barber tells  Tech in Asia  that the company is looking to boost production capacity by 10 times. That would be enough to support the  daily eating habits  of over 11,000 Singapore inhabitants on average. 
 It was a wake-up call about the need for food security. 
 He says the decision to speed up ComCrop’s expansion came after Singaporeans went on a  round of panic-buying in March , when Malaysia announced a nationwide lockdown. The neighboring country is one of Singapore’s  top sources of food products,  and many were worried that supplies would run out amid such restrictions. 
 “It was a wake-up call about the need for food security. The shelves were empty – you could literally see your face reflected in the veggie section,” shares Barber. “We’re trying to ramp up our production so when panic-buying happens again, it wouldn’t be such a big shock to Singapore’s food supply.” 
 While it’s aiming to produce more, ComCrop’s main objective is to stay price competitive. “A head of lettuce can’t cost S$30 (US$21). The same workforce we’re selling to is the same workforce that’s losing jobs right now. So, we can’t say, ‘Come buy our products,’ unless we are affordable,” he explains.

  Edible Garden City  is another Singaporean firm that’s ramping up production to meet a higher demand for produce. Through its Citizen Farm service, the company delivers a variety of leafy vegetables, microgreens, mushrooms, herbs, and flowers, which are grown on its urban farm. “Over the past few weeks, we had a 20% increase in uptake for our weekly subscription vegetable box,” according to a spokesperson. 
 The social enterprise uses agritech to overcome space or climate limitations by turning underutilized areas in malls and neighborhoods into green community spaces. For example, it grows kale and specialty Japanese vegetables in indoor climate-controlled environments, stacking the planters to maximize space. 
 “We are committed to helping Singapore become more food resilient,” the company representative says. 
 Adapting to the new normal 
 With farmers and agricultural workers keeping their distance from the fields because of movement limits or Covid-19 infection fears, the normal production capacities of farms and food processing factories  have been reduced . 
 However,  Talad , a Thailand-based startup that connects farmers and workers and serves as a marketplace for agriproducts, sees an opportunity in this crisis. Its co-founder Huynh Hien tells  Tech in Asia  that the firm is adjusting its operations as droves of people are going back to the countryside for a “quieter” life amid the nationwide lockdown. “We want to focus on recruiting and contracting these returning people for farm labor,” Huynh says.

 Talad enables farmers and laborers to directly negotiate for contractual or long-term work. Eliminating the need for a middleman also leads to mutual gain, as the commission saved is passed on to both parties. 
 “Many laborers and farmers can’t circulate… due to Covid-19. But with our app, both parties can find roles within their respective provinces. This way, farms can avoid shutting down due to the lack of manpower to support operations,” notes Huynh. 
 He adds that since November 2018, about 20,000 bookings have been made between farmers and workers on Talad, amounting to some US$900,000 in transactions. 
 In neighboring Myanmar, which exports rice to over 50 countries, more farmers are turning to digital solutions as well due to the pandemic. As such, startups will step up their efforts to cater growing demand, several founders tell  Tech in Asia .

 “Farmers’ access to productivity advice, agro-inputs, buyers, and financing is now even more restricted,” observes Erwin Sikma, founder of  Impact Terra.  The firm’s Golden Paddy app helps farmers expand market connections and gives easier access to financing. So far, the app has helped users sell their crops for up to 10% more on the market since the startup began operations in 2016. 
 While these smallholder farmers generate up to  80% of Asia’s produce , an estimated 400 million of them make up a significant portion of the world’s poor, living on  less than US$2 a day on average . Generally, they own small plots of land on which they grow subsistence crops, relying  almost exclusively on family labor . 
 And that’s exactly why startups have to step in to support them, and where investment needs to grow,” suggests Hemendra Mathur, co-founder of Delhi-based ThinkAg and a venture partner at Bharat Innovation Fund (BIF), a venture capital fund focused on deep technology. “Most agritech startups are severely constrained by a lack of capital.” 
 BIF has nearly 20 agritech businesses in its portfolio and gives out US$50,000 to US$200,000 in early-stage funding per startup. It’s raising another US$100 million “within the next few months” to get more startups in its incubator programs during the pandemic, which Mathur believes will call for more innovation in agritech. 
 ComCrop’s Barber says that Singapore’s agriculture challenges are similar to India’s. At its current size, the startup can only grow so much, and its main obstacle is the lack of support at the infrastructure level.

 “We have big ambitions to set up our farms in every neighborhood in Singapore. But for that to happen, we need the community, the government, and landlords to all come together to make that a reality,” he stresses. 
 As Covid-19 has shown, there’s nothing like a global health crisis to highlight the weaknesses of existing systems and the value of preparedness. “Food production is like national defense and security: You don’t do it for bragging rights, only for the right to survive,” concludes Barber.

 According to BuyMed, the US$65 billion pharmaceutical industry is plagued by gray market practices, substandard safety measures, and complicated distribution channels. With an aim to streamline the market, the company founded Thuocsi in 2018 to connect healthcare practitioners with healthcare manufacturers, brand owners, and distributors. 
 BuyMed will use the new funds to grow across Vietnam and the rest of Southeast Asia. It will also hire talent in mobile development, supply chain, and fulfillment as it expands the team to Hanoi and establish Thuocsi as a national distribution platform. 
 It also looks to add new product lines, including cosmetics, medical devices, supplements, and medical services, as it aims to become a one-stop marketplace for healthcare providers. 
 BuyMed said that it has tripled its revenue, with monthly orders increasing 13x in the last 12 months. The Thuocsi platform, meanwhile, has achieved 250% growth in the past six months, serving over 7,000 pharmacies, clinics, and hospitals across the country. It now has a network of more than 700 suppliers, distributors, and manufacturers, according to a statement. 
 The startup also said that since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, Thuocsi has seen an increase in demand from pharmacies and clinics. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(1, 0.22292116), (3, 0.7748727)]","['Surge', 'BuyMed', 'VC', 'Thuocsi']","['Vietnam', 'Hanoi']"
645626,Quest Ventures leads $7m round for logistics startup Moovaz," The mobility industry, which is estimated to be worth US$80.2 billion globally, is plagued by opacity, manual processes, and a convoluted supply chain, according to  Moovaz , a Singapore-based logistics startup that aims to revolutionize the sector. 
 For the relocation industry, customers tend to get price-discriminated due to the lack of transparency. Processes are also cumbersome, expensive, and slow due to a lack of digitalization, Junxian Lee, the founder and CEO of Moovaz, told  Tech in Asia . 
 The startup just formally announced that it has received backing from venture capital firm Quest Ventures, the lead investor in its  US$7 million series A funding round . Other investors include Supply Chain Angels and SGInnovate, among others.

 Moovaz joins Quest Ventures’ portfolio which includes familiar startups such as Carousell, ShopBack, 99.co, Carro, StyleTheory, Glife, Xfers, and others. The Singapore-based VC firm recently hit the  first close  of its US$50 million fund aimed at post-seed and series A opportunities across Southeast Asia. 
 With the series A money, Moovaz plans to double down on its product builds and develop new business units and services for expats and “global-locals.” It also plans to expand to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Australia. 
 According to the startup, 40% of international relocations are going toward Asia, driven by the increased cost of living in the developed West, more flexibility in immigration laws in key markets such as China, India, and Spain, as well as heightened economic activity in Southeast Asia. 
 Founded in 2017, Moovaz uses machine intelligence to collect and analyze data at each stage of a client’s relocation journey to optimize both the speed and cost involved in the move. It also runs a recommendation engine for long-tail services. 
 But with cross-border travel heavily regulated due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Lee admits that the current demand for relocation has been curtailed. However, he expects a surge in demand once the restrictions are relaxed. 
 In the meantime, the company is making use of the downtime to reshuffle its product development roadmaps, focus on capacity building, and training. 
 “Covid-19 presents opportunities for us,” Lee said. “There are opportunities for deep strategic partnerships during this period for companies (especially tech companies) to work closely together to find a way out of the woods.” 
 Moovaz previously secured  US$1 million  in seed funding from Mojo Partners, the family office fund of Singaporean billionaire Ong Beng Seng, and senior execs from American and Chinese unicorns. It was followed by  investments  from Hustle Fund and two former 500 Startups partners last year.

 The new injection was led by Malaysia’s Duopharma Biotech, M Venture Partners from Singapore, RHL Ventures from Kuala Lumpur, and other local and international private investors, according to a statement.

 Through its app, Naluri combines behavioral science, data science, and digital design to offer health coaching and psychological support. It assigns personal health experts to users battling or at risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, or chronic depression, anxiety, and stress. 
 It plans to use the fresh capital to extend its runway to at least 12 to 15 months as it gears up for its series A round. Jeremy Ting, president and co-founder of Naluri, said the company has already gained strong interest from investors for its next round, and it wants “to be able to demonstrate continued growth domestically and regionally.” 
 The latest investment comes at a time when digital health solutions are seeing increased traction, as healthcare providers are overwhelmed by rising Covid-19 cases. Naluri CEO and co-founder Azran Osman-Rani also said that the startup has seen a “significant” increase in cases of mental health complications, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, due to the ongoing pandemic. 
 Another startup that has seen an uptick in activity in its platform is Singapore-based teleheath provider Doctor Anywhere. In a statement announcing the company’s recent  US$27 million  series B raise, CEO Lim Wai Mun said that the business has experienced a two- to threefold jump in growth since the Covid-19 outbreak started.

 “After very careful and painful consideration, we have decided to take the appropriate and responsible action now to ensure that we can weather this storm and protect the long-term success of our organization,” Ethan Lin, CEO and co-founder of Klook, told  Tech in Asia  in a statement. “It is a very difficult decision but we have to take the next step of cost-optimization measures.” 
 The decision will impact around  10% to 20%  of the company’s total headcount across most of the functions, according to a report by  TTG Asia . 
 Lin assured that affected employees will continue to receive healthcare coverage and other benefits, such as the company’s Employee Assistance Program. 
 The chief exec also said that he and his co-founders will not be receiving any salary until the end of the crisis, while the leadership team will be taking voluntary pay cuts. 
 The company will also implement a temporarily reduced workweek across the organization. 
 The global travel industry has been severely hit by the Covid-19 crisis: Myanmar-based travel startup Flymya has  laid off a third of its headcount  this year as bookings dropped, while India-based hotel chain Oyo just placed “a significant number” of its employees on  temporary leave or furloughs  after it saw its revenue and occupancy dip by as much as 60%. 
 Founded in 2014, Klook offers a digital platform that lets travelers discover and book tours and experiences. It most recently raised a total of  US$425 million  in a series D round from SoftBank Vision Fund and Sequoia Capital China, among others, last year. 
 During its fifth anniversary in September 2019, Klook announced its plans to  double its workforce  from 1,200 to over 2,500 in more than 30 offices by 2020, in an effort to bolster its international presence in Asia Pacific and Europe.

645705,Amartha CEO steps down as special adviser to Jokowi,"  Amartha  CEO Andi Taufan Garuda Putra has resigned from his post as a special staffer to Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, shortly after fellow staffer Belva Devara, CEO and co-founder of Ruangguru,  officially announced  his exit from the same position. 
 
  Amartha’s CEO, Andi Taufan Garuda Putra / Photo credit: Amartha 
 
 In an  open letter  to members of the local media, Taufan said that President Widodo has approved his resignation, which he submitted on April 17. 
 “This resignation is solely based on my sincere desire to be able to fully serve the economic empowerment of the community, especially those running micro and small businesses,” Taufan wrote. 
 Prior to his resignation, the 33-year-old drew flak from social media users and politicians alike after he had asked district heads across Indonesia to support a Covid-19 relief program led by his own peer-to-peer lending firm. He has since revoked that request and issued an apology. 
 “So many valuable lessons I learned. I also did not escape from various shortcomings. For that, I apologize again and will try my best to be better,” Taufan also stated in the letter. 
 Ruangguru’s Devara had been similarly caught in controversy before he stepped down from his government post, facing accusations of conflict of interest after his company was picked as a partner in the government’s new pre-employment card program. Devara denied the claims, saying that Ruangguru went through a selection process carried out by the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs and Managing Management. 
 Taufan and Devara, along with 12 other individuals, were  handpicked by President Widodo  to serve as his special staffers in November 2019. “They will provide me with innovative ideas, sparking out-of-the-box ideas that will help us achieve progress,” President Widodo said at the time. 
 The appointments, however, were almost immediately met with criticism. A public policy observer had  previously said  that while they gave the younger generation a chance to participate more in the country’s development, the staffers would still face a feudal bureaucratic culture within the government.

645636,Do food delivery platforms deserve the public beating they’re getting?," These days, Colin Chen has taken on the mantle of restaurant manager, logistics operator, and software engineer. 
 The owner of The Refinery, a yakitori joint located in central Singapore, has set up a delivery system using free software to supplement profits, which have plunged as the country banned dine-in eating and shut offices as part of  measures to curb the Covid-19 pandemic . 
 
  GrabFood / Photo credit: Grab 
 
 Chen’s plight, which he has shared in a  Facebook post  that has since gone viral, is calling into question the seemingly exorbitant fees that food delivery operators are charging food establishments. 
 With online deliveries now a main source of income – making up over 80% for some – restaurateurs are feeling the pinch from the hefty commission fees even though food delivery companies in Singapore that  Tech in Asia  spoke to say their rates haven’t changed. In fact, while their fees seem expensive, platforms only take a small cut, with the lion’s share going to riders, this publication finds. 
 Regardless, food establishments have turned to alternative methods to survive – whether it’s sourcing their own delivery drivers, pushing out their menus on open Facebook groups to gain visibility, or figuring out an internal online ordering system. Attractive options apart from the city-state’s three main players – GrabFood, Deliveroo, and Foodpanda – have also emerged, charging a fraction of the commission fees. But these alternatives often don’t seem to offer the full range of services that the main platforms do. 
 It seems that, for now, many F&amp;B operators have little choice but to embrace the services of the main food delivery firms. 
 The numbers are telling: Foodpanda, which serves 9,000 restaurants and hawkers on its app, said that the number of merchants on its platform had  increased by 200%  in the past month, while GrabFood has onboarded more than 1,500 merchants in Singapore since January. The number of orders on GrabFood has also increased by 20% since early April.

 “They choose to work with a delivery platform like GrabFood as it allows them to onboard quickly and minimizes the upfront cost and resource needed to start and maintain an online business,” a Grab spokesperson tells  Tech in Asia . Grab’s technical, fleet, and customer support also ensures orders are fulfilled within a given timeframe, the spokesperson adds. 
 Caught in a media storm 
 GrabFood currently charges merchants  “up to 30%”  in commissions for every order, while Foodpanda’s fees are  between 30% to 35% . These fees depend on an establishment’s brand name, number and location of outlets, and type of cuisine,  and average basket size, a Foodpanda spokesperson says. 
 Delivery operators are not planning to slash rates, however. Instead, Grab is hastening the pace of onboarding food merchants and “offering commission rebates, commission deferrals, and marketing support so they can better manage their cash flow during this period,” group CEO Anthony Tan said in a press statement. 
 I’ve turned off our Grab terminal. 
 A new  islandwide delivery  service, which the company implemented in early April, has along with other measures increased the order volume for some of its merchants, such as The Loco Group, by 30%. 
 In April, Grab and Deliveroo introduced a 5% commission rebate, with  support from government agency Enterprise Singapore . Grab is also waiving commissions on self-pickup orders, while Foodpanda waived onboarding fees and is offering zero-percent commissions for new merchants. 
 But struggling restaurants don’t think these companies are doing enough. “I’ve turned off our Grab terminal,”  wrote Anthony Yeoh , the owner of French bistro Summer Hill. Instead, the chef called on diners to support local F&amp;B operators by picking up their orders instead. 
 Delivery riders have also taken to social media platforms to voice their grievances after Grab was accused of slashing incentive payouts earlier this month and raising the number of trips required to qualify for them. 
 “We’re not asking for [more incentives] – the least you could do in this period of global instability is offer your partners some stability – keep the previous pay calculations, keep the incentive payouts and qualifications as they were before, and keep your rider policies consistent,” a GrabFood rider, who has been with the company for over two months,  wrote on Reddit . 
   
 “On an ongoing basis, GrabFood projects the demand and supply conditions on our platform and adjusts partners’ incentive programme to ensure there will be sufficient delivery partners to meet consumers’ needs,” a Grab spokesperson says. 
 The delivery riders’ take home earnings may have taken a hit as more people,  including Grab’s driver fleet , sign on to the platform as delivery riders. 
 Are fees really that exorbitant? 
 Grab has since addressed merchant and customer concerns in a  blog post . While the company earns a commission of between 25% to 30% per transaction on average, delivery fees go entirely to the driver. 
 In the example laid out in its blog post, a “majority” of Grab’s cut flows back to the drivers as extra income. The rest of it goes into covering operating costs, such as maintaining its platform, managing its rider fleet, as well as running marketing promotions, to name a few. 
 After all, delivering food is just one of the services that Grab provides. Merchants on the platform also stand to benefit from professional services on the platform such as business intelligence and analytics, marketing tools, financing support, and digital payments. 
   
 Singapore’s three main operators aren’t the only ones facing heightened public scrutiny. Globally, Meituan, Uber Eats, and Grubhub, too, have drawn anger from flustered restaurants. In San Francisco, the extent of public outrage has prompted the city’s mayor to  cap commissions at 15% . 
 “Most food delivery platforms charge a 30% take rate,” David Dai, a senior analyst at research and brokerage firm Sanford C. Bernstein tells  Tech in Asia . The company covers leading Chinese delivery app  Meituan  and Alibaba-owned  Ele.me , but Dai himself does not cover Grab. 
 A sustainable take rate, Bernstein analysis suggests, ranges between 20% to 30%. 
 Among the numerous food delivery platforms running loss-making operations worldwide, Meituan stands out for  being profitable . The Beijing-based operator processed a daily average of 23.9 million orders in China last year and could serve as a barometer of how operators in Singapore might evolve despite notable differences in market and business models. 
   
 Meituan’s merchant commission fee of 13% – based on Bernstein-adjusted figures – is an outlier against European player Delivery Hero’s 20.6% and London-based Just Eat’s 26.8%. 
 Despite their higher delivery fees, UberEats and Delivery Hero are both operating at a loss. “Meituan’s key advantage is its low delivery expense, indicating that it has the most cost-efficient delivery system,” Bernstein analysts wrote. The report cites Meituan’s scale, the high urban density of its market, and low labor costs in China as significant factors. 
 In the industry, delivery costs are the single highest expense and the reason why food delivery operators are bleeding cash. At 7 yuan, or US$1, Meituan’s per order delivery costs are significantly lower than those in developed markets where UberEats and Delivery Hero operate. Delivery expenses for the latter two range between US$4 to US$5 per order. 
 In contrast, players like Takeaway.com, Grubhub, and Just Eat – which largely have restaurants largely manage deliveries on their own – have higher and positive operating profit margins (see figure 2). 
   
 The data suggests two things: First, at around 30%, the commissions that operators in Singapore demand are on the higher end of what food delivery firms are charging globally. Second, unlike Meituan, there is little room for GrabFood, Foodpanda, and Deliveroo to decrease their fees, given that global peers who have commissions of close to 30% are still unprofitable. 
 Notably, Meituan has drawn flak for  increasing its commissions . The platform is reportedly charging newly opened catering merchants in China during Covid-19. In an open letter, the Guangdong Restaurant Association claimed that the company was demanding up to 26% in fees. 
 The Chinese delivery platform has since issued a rebuttal, saying it only asks for between 10% to 20% from a majority of businesses on its platform. 
 A lack of alternatives? 
 As tough times push restaurant owners to get creative, many are exploring alternative online ordering and delivery systems. 
 A few notable players have emerged. Online delivery platform  Oddle  helps businesses build their own delivery platforms through order management and by customizing their online menus. The Singapore-based startup, which has been operating since 2014, also offers business analytics and logistics support through its partner  Lalamove . 
 We have to stay on these channels as an additional marketing or sales channel so long as they are actively used by consumers. 
 “They [Oddle] are something like GrabFood and Deliveroo. The only difference is that they give us our own webpage,” Livia Quek, who handles marketing and commissions for casual diner Rookery, tells  Tech in Asia . The diner has recently started using the service, which Quek says, was user-friendly and easy to set up. 
 When a food order comes through via a restaurant’s Oddle-powered webpage, orders are pushed to the restaurant for fulfillment, while the logistics requirements are directed to Lalamove. Quek says, however, that the delivery process has been “extremely frustrating” due to riders arriving late and technical glitches cropping up. 
 Oddle did not immediately respond to  Tech in Asia ’s queries on its rates, but restaurateur Victor Ng  told  The Straits Times   that the platform charges a 10% commission, while delivery fees are shouldered equally by the restaurant and the customer. 
 Lalamove’s on-demand courier service spans the F&amp;B and ecommerce sectors, but managing director Alex Lin tells  Tech in Asia  that demand for F&amp;B-related deliveries has grown 300% since the start of April. He expects this to increase by a further six to seven  times in the coming weeks, as many F&amp;B merchants are ramping up online deliveries, he adds. 
 While Lalamove partners with aggregators like Oddle, it’s also working directly with food merchants like hawkers, fast food chains, and restaurants. It has also received requests for ad-hoc delivery support from major food delivery operators, which Lin declined to name.

 Another startup that has risen to the challenge is Chope, which launched its delivery service,  Chope On , a few weeks ago – an effort CEO Arrif Ziaudeen says took all of three days to get up and running. 
 The service is currently in beta phase and has over 20 middle to high-end restaurants on the platform. Its delivery fleet is currently made up of transport provider SMRT’s fleet of taxi drivers, many of whom are out of work as demand for cab rides plunge during the pandemic. 
 “Restaurants that come on board our delivery offering can access readily available features such as analytics, payments support, customer relationship management, and a targeted marketing database,” which are part of Chope’s existing capabilities, Ziaudeen explains. 
   
 It’s possible that GrabFood, Foodpanda, and Deliveroo are charging higher commissions because they’re providing a more comprehensive service, though Chope’s new delivery offering challenges this. 
 Chope’s take rate of 15% per order is a fraction of what major food delivery players are charging in the city-state. But that’s partly because it serves higher tier restaurants, with greater minimum order values – around S$50 (US$35) for most of its establishments. 
 Not all food operators think the added services warrant their high fees, though. Kelly Koh, the manager of All That Batter, a cafe that’s on both GrabFood and Foodpanda, is exploring other more competitively-priced options even though half her daily orders currently come through these channels. Koh continues to liaise directly with private-hire drivers to coordinate deliveries for orders coming through phone and WhatsApp, even though this requires extra effort on her part. 
 David vs. Goliath 
 Food delivery platforms used to serve as a customer acquisition and marketing tool for F&amp;B businesses. But they’ve quickly become a lifeline for restaurants that are no longer able to seat dine-in customers. 
 In spite of “steep” commissions, small food establishments find that they have little choice at the moment. “We have to stay on these channels as an additional marketing or sales channel so long as they are actively used by consumers,” says Koh. 
 Now a main revenue stream, online deliveries have become an important means for restaurateurs to cover fixed costs such as rental expenses. But this places an unfair burden on food delivery operators, as the service should be seen as complementary rather than a replacement for dine-in revenue, an industry watcher who wished to remain anonymous tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Small, independent food businesses are also flocking to such platforms to stay afloat, even though the high costs associated with these platforms may not be suitable for their scale of operations. High delivery expenses – as outlined earlier – mean that orders have to be sizable in order for trips to be efficient for both delivery platforms and merchants. 
 Restaurant owner Jeremy Cheok, a member of the #Savefnbsg movement which is calling for delivery commissions to be  reduced to 15% , tells  Tech in Asia  that he still hopes delivery platforms can do more to help food establishments tide through the pandemic. 
 “All we want to see is the delivery platforms step up and stand in solidarity with the suffering F&amp;B industry,” he says.

645571,AI startup that wants to personalize dining experiences secures funding," Millennials love the experience and convenience of dining out: According to a 2019  study , about 54% of them would eat out at least three times a week. But despite the apparent business opportunity it presents, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, the market has not seen any significant technology-driven disruption yet, Mohd Wassem, founder and CEO of  Easy Eat , told  Tech in Asia . 
 Easy Eat is a Singapore-based startup that uses AI to personalize and reward users’ dining experiences. It just announced it has raised an undisclosed amount of pre-series A funding from Bala Chandra, managing partner of India-based Vernalis Capital, his family office, and five other angel investors.

 According to Wassem, there is a significant disconnect between customers and restaurants, which hinders the latter from providing better service. “We are bridging that gap,” Wassem said. “There are a few [startups] who are seriously trying to address it, but most of them are either addressing delivery issues or the backend of the restaurants.” He added that no one is focusing on the customers. 
 Wassem, who had founded the Saif Partners-backed Bobble, launched Easy Eat last year with Rhythm Gupta, Abdul Khalid, Akshay Chauhan, and Alok Ranjan. The startup offers a web-based app that digitizes all customer-facing interactions in restaurants, from menu browsing, ordering, and tracking to making payments. It also suggests customization options based on user preferences and history. 
 “The more a user uses Easy Eat’s AI tech, the more personalized it gets,” said Wassem. “Imagine the app taking care of your dining preferences, allergies, calories, [and] the best payment options, and rewarding you for loyalty without any extra effort.” 
 The startup’s solution, which is still in private beta mode, also automatically generates sales and daily business reports for restaurants. 
 With the new investment, the company plans to further develop its AI capabilities, build partnerships, and launch the product in May. Wassem also disclosed that the startup has already signed up tens of restaurants for the platform’s launch. 
  Contactless dining  
 Vernalis Capital’s Chandra was the first investor in Wassem’s previous venture. The Covid-19 pandemic convinced him to back Wassem’s second business, as he believes the world will see a large-scale tech adoption in the industry. “Restaurant offerings, from ordering to payments to service delivery, will all go contactless,” Chandra predicted. 
 Wassem agreed with this, saying that the most affected restaurants by the ongoing global crisis are those with no data or analytics capabilities. “Restaurants who would continue in the same model will find it difficult to be sustainable,” he said. 
 With offices in Malaysia and India, Easy Eat has an ambitious plan to transform restaurants into tech companies. It intends to launch in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines this year. “Our focus for the next few years is going to be Southeast Asia,” Wassem said. “In all likelihood, we shall be profitable in a year’s time.” ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.99968404)]","['app', 'Bobble', 'Wassem']","['Singapore', 'AI', 'digitizes', 'Asia', 'India', 'Malaysia', 'Philippines', 'Vietnam', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia']"

 ABOUT 
 
 Raised: US$10 million 
 Investors: Greylock Partners 
 
 LinkedIn stands as the largest social media platform for professionals today. In the early days, it described itself as “the Friendster for business,” referring to the now-defunct social media platform. 
 Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn’s co-founder, didn’t think comparing the firm with Friendster was an attractive context for fundraising, so to set itself apart, it began defining the business as a “network of trusted professionals.” The move is explained in this 2004 series B pitch deck, which bagged the company US$10 million from Greylock Partners. 
  How is the deck compelling?  
 
 Its first few slides distinctly define what LinkedIn is, why its network and platform functionalities are valuable, and what sets it apart from other websites at the time. 
 The pitch establishes the company’s first-mover advantage in the space, comparing itself with firms in adjacent internet businesses like Google, eBay and PayPal. 
 It illustrates that LinkedIn has exceeded its growth projections and has established market leadership. 
 Prominent partner organizations who use the platform and believe in its potential were listed down. 
 The presentation reveals that the company has achieved some key accomplishments and that it spent a little less than its series A funding. 
 It consistently hammers in the value of the firm’s network-empowered platform, its traction so far, and its viable revenue model, which it would use to fuel future growth. 
 With its pitch, LinkedIn is essentially saying, “We have potential for both high revenue and high margins, and here’s why.” 
 The deck lists conservative projections on when the company will achieve operating profitability. 
 
 It’s a very meaty deck. Fortunately, Hoffman wrote an extensive, in-depth analysis of the deck  here .

 According to documents filed with the Indian government, Falcon Edge contributed 718.5 million rupees (US$9.4 million), while Bytedance, Goldman Sachs Asia, and Advent Management Belgium invested US$4.6 million each into the company. Dailyhunt has allotted a total of 138,000 series G1 convertible preference shares to its investors. 
 According to local media  Entrackr , the 12-year-old startup’s valuation has crossed the half-a-billion mark at US$542.8 million. 
 The company, which also counts Sequoia Capital and Omidyar Network as its backers, has long been on the radar of global investors. Last year, it was reportedly in talks with Japanese conglomerate SoftBank about raising around US$150 million. Meanwhile, according to  DealStreetAsia , private equity firm Carlyle had also shown interest to buy an equity stake in the news aggregator. 
 Prior to this round, the company had raised US$3 million from Cayman Islands-based Stonebridge Capital and US$22 million from Belgium-based Sofina mid-2019 in its series F round. 
 The fresh funding comes at a time when demand for bite-sized news, information, and digital media has soared as millions of Indians are forced to stay indoors due to the nationwide lockdown implemented to prevent the spread of Covid-19. 
 American media measurement and analytics company Comscore said that while “the traffic to websites and mobile apps in the General News category in India was showing an increasing trend ever since the news of the pandemic started, things accelerated in the second half of March 2020.” Within the first week of the nationwide lockdown that started on March 25, visits to digital news websites and apps saw a sudden spike. 
 “Compared with the week of March 16 to 22, 2020, visits increased by 30% during the week of March 23 to 29, 2020,” Comscore said in a blog post. The visits were up by 97% when compared to the week of February 10 to 16 this year. 
 Dailyhunt was founded by former Nokia executives Umesh Kulkarni and Chandrashekhar Sohoni in 2007, and was later acquired by Ver Se Innovation in 2012. Initially known as Newshunt, Ver Se rebranded it as Dailyhunt in August 2015. 
 The company has partnered with over 1,300 publications and claims to aggregate over 250,000 news and non-news content every day in 14 Indian languages. It also offers original vernacular video content and a free live television streaming service with more than 130 channels across nine languages through strategic media partnerships. 
 Out of India’s 725 districts (geographical sub-division of a state), the company has a presence in over 400 districts. Currently, Dailyhunt claims to have over 252 million monthly active users and more than 51 million daily active users, who spend over 27 minutes on the platform per day, according to the company’s official LinkedIn profile.

645561,Beyond Meat enters China via Starbucks partnership,"  Beyond Meat , the world’s biggest meat substitute maker, announced on Monday that it has officially entered the Chinese market through a partnership with Starbucks.

 The US-based coffee chain introduced a plant-based menu featuring pasta, lasagna, and wraps made by Beyond Meat’s alternative beef product this week, with prices ranging from 59 yuan (US$8.33) to 69 yuan (US$9.74). The new menu has been available in more than 3,300 Starbucks locations across China since Wednesday, according to a statement from Beyond Meat. 
 Starbucks’ new offerings also include dishes from plant-based pork alternative brand Omnipork and beverages with oat milk provided by Swedish brand Oatly. 
 “Today we mark an important milestone as Beyond Meat launches in China, advancing our goal of increasing accessibility to plant-based meat globally,” said Beyond Meat Founder and CEO Ethan Brown. 
 To better connect with Chinese consumers, Beyond Meat has created a website in Chinese and launched official accounts on popular social media channels Weibo and WeChat, said the company. 
 The partnership with Starbucks marks Beyond Meat’s official entry in China, where the market for alternative meat products remains untapped compared to the US. The company was looking to expand its production to Asia by the end of 2020 as part of its strategy to sell its products in China,  Reuters  reported. 
 California-headquartered rival Impossible Foods, the maker of Burger King’s hit plant-based Impossible Whopper, has reportedly been in early talks with Chinese firms as it looks to enter the market. 
 Some local companies are eyeing the large Chinese market as well. Artificial meat startup Starfield, which provides alternative meat products to merchants in China such as pizza chain Papa John’s and tea brand Nayuki, has taken in tens of millions of yuan in a round of financing in March. 
 Beyond Meat’s early investor, New Crop Capital, and its China-focused investment partner Dao Foods International have participated in this round, along with Joy Capital and Matrix Partners China. 
 Also, Chinese firm Shuangta marketed China’s first pea protein-based meat mooncakes in September 2019. The product is based on pea protein tissues extracted from starch, said Shuangta, adding that it has also started to provide pea protein to Beyond Meat. 
 The global alternative meat market is predicted to hit an annual value of US$140 billion, about 10% of the US$1.4 trillion worldwide meat market predicted in the next decade, according to a Barclay report.

645484,Singapore-based SensorFlow bags $8.3m in series A+ money,"  SensorFlow , a Singapore-based startup that helps hotels and commercial properties optimize energy and operations, today announced that it has raised US$8.3 million in a series A+ round led by Openspace Ventures and Gaw Capital Partners. 
 Proptech-focused venture capital fund Aurum Investments and Pierre Lorient, a private investor and finance veteran, also participated in the round. 
 The new investment follows SensorFlow’s  US$2.7 million  series A raise from Lorient, Cocoon Capital, and Playfair Capital in February 2019.

 Founded in 2016, SensorFlow uses the internet of things and AI to help buildings automate heating and ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, as well as monitor equipment performance and optimize housekeeping routes. 
 Its wireless IoT solution gathers real-time data on guest behavior within hotel rooms, then optimizes energy usage automatically. It also activates maintenance alerts when it detects faulty equipment. According to SensorFlow, the solution can be retrofitted into any room within five minutes. 
 The firm claims that its solutions could help save up to 30% in total energy bills and up to 40% in maintenance costs. 
  See:  Singapore energy startup nabs $2.7m to create ‘smart hotels’ in Southeast Asia   
 With the investment, SensorFlow plans to hire for hardware and data science roles and expand to new markets such as Japan, Australia, Europe, and the US. It will also develop solutions that automate heating systems and help hotels navigate the Covid-19 economy. 
 To help its partners cope, SensorFlow said it is developing new solutions, such as a “housekeeping view” feature that uses live occupancy data to help hotels optimize cleaning routes. Engineering teams, meanwhile, can also leverage system performance data to generate performance benchmarks, develop predictive maintenance strategies, and resolve HVAC issues on the spot. 
 “For the hospitality sector, the need for optimizing energy and operational efficiency is especially pertinent now as it works on recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Saikrishnan Ranganathan, the CEO and co-founder of SensorFlow. “Our technology can help hotels and properties maximize the use of limited resources, adopt clean technologies, and become more sustainable. 
 SensorFlow’s solutions are being used by about 10,000 hotel rooms across Southeast Asia, according to a statement. The company aims to increase this number to around 1 million worldwide by 2023.

645502,"Swiggy mulls laying off 500 cloud kitchen workers, report says"," India’s  Swiggy  is looking to lay off roughly 500 of its cloud kitchen staff, as the food delivery major makes adjustments to conserve cash and increase its runway. 
 
  Photo credit: Swiggy 
 
 The job cuts, which will affect mostly contractual employees, is set to take place from cloud kitchens across 10 tier-one and two cities,  Livemint  reported, citing people familiar with the situation. 
 In November last year, Swiggy started focusing on cloud kitchens, launching 1,000 virtual kitchens for its restaurant partners in India. However, the lockdown prompted by Covid-19 hit this business hard, as it depends mostly on ground workers such as kitchen staff and delivery persons. 
 In response, Swiggy may close the majority of its cloud kitchens, relocate them, and renegotiate rental contracts, the report said. 
 “There were some cuts on jobs with respect to efficiency (of roles); this was, however, sanctioned by the board pre-Covid time itself,” a Swiggy executive who declined to be named told  Livemint . “Around four to five months ago, we were beginning to end contracts with cloud kitchen brands that were not efficiently able to service demand.” 
 The exec also said that Swiggy is currently not considering any pay cuts, but has warned its employees that there will be no pay hikes this year. 
  Tech in Asia  has reached out to Swiggy for a statement on the matter. 
 Yesterday,  Entrackr  reported that the Bengaluru-based startup is expected to slash about 800 to 900 employees from its workforce next month. The move comes after Swiggy received board approval for its cost-cutting plan, several people with knowledge of the matter said. 
 “The employees that are expected to be asked to leave are going to be across teams in their cloud kitchen division,” one of them said. 
 Just weeks ago, Swiggy announced it has secured  US$43 million  as part of its series I financing round, its second major raise this year after banking  US$113 million  in February. The startup previously said it will use the series I funds to expand into new lines of business, including cloud kitchens and new categories for its on-demand services.

645482,Oyo asks employees in India to take 25% pay cut,"  Oyo Hotels and Homes  has asked all its employees in India to accept a 25% reduction in their salaries for four months, starting April. The announcement comes weeks after the company furloughed thousands of its workers due to the pandemic’s economic impact.

 The Softbank-backed startup has also sent some of its people on leave with limited benefits from May 4 until August this year, according to a statement. Oyo previously said that health benefits for its furloughed staff will continue. 
 “Our company is taking a difficult but necessary step for India, whereby we are asking all OYOprenuers to accept a reduction in their fixed compensation by 25%,” Rohit Kapoor, Oyo’s CEO for India and South Asia, said in a memo. 
 Kapoor noted that all of the other benefits and contracts of those affected will remain unchanged. Oyo also made sure that after the pay cuts, the fixed compensation for any employee won’t fall below 500,000 rupees (US$6,500) a year. 
 Oyo also remained adamant that it does not intend to cut jobs in India during this time. 
 In a video message to Oyo staff about two weeks ago, Oyo founder and group CEO Ritesh Agarwal said that the company had to place a significant number of its employees on  temporarily leave or furloughs  to ensure long-term cash runway for the business. 
 “At the latest, the revenues of Oyo and the occupancies have dropped by over 50% to 60%,” Agarwal said, noting that other hotel chains have been seeing declines of about 75% or more. He also said that he will forego all of his salary for the year, while the leadership team has agreed to take pay cuts of 25% to over 50%. 
 Prior to the announcement, Oyo had reportedly laid off  hundreds of employees  in the US. Abhinav Sinha, Oyo’s chief operating officer, told the American team in an email announcing the layoffs that Oyo will be shifting its focus on sustainable growth. 
 In March, it was also reported that Oyo has slashed  more than 7,000 employees  in China since November 2019. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(2, 0.99943393)]","['OYOprenuers', 'Oyo', 'Softbank']","['US', 'India', 'China']"
645403,Is Disney finding India’s Hotstar too hot to handle?," In the 1934 animated Disney classic   The Big Bad Wolf  , a pig warns Little Red Riding Hood, “Better to be safe than sorry. Shortcuts are not always good.” 
 Over eight decades later, the pig’s advice may come in handy for Disney.

 The iconic US media firm took control of Hotstar as part of its US$71 billion  purchase  of 21st Century Fox in March 2019. But a year later, clashes between the companies’ executives on everything from content and strategy to culture are getting in the way of Disney’s vision for a  “transformative era” , several people tell  Tech in Asia . These struggles are also putting profitability at risk, they say. 
 Both companies did not respond to requests for comment. 
 Apart from creating a content production powerhouse, the deal gives Disney access to multiple distribution channels across the globe, such as over-the-top (OTT) streaming service  Hotstar . A subsidiary of Fox’s Star India, Hotstar brings in millions of viewers from the world’s  second-most populous country . Its content programming and choices, however, leave a lot to be desired from Disney’s perspective, the sources point out. 
 Hotstar still  features  risque shows to keep up with competitors like Voot, which streams  Naagin , a popular fantasy thriller about shape shifting serpent women. The show’s full-bosomed lead star  wears  a bustier that’s a size small for her frame.

 “Disney won’t be caught dead with that image,” says a former senior executive at Hotstar, referring to how the empire that Mickey Mouse built zealously protects  its family-friendly reputation . As such, Hotstar is now  addressing  some of these issues. 
 Though Disney is known as a process-oriented company, Hotstar has stuck to the aggressive and play-as-you-go culture that it inherited from Star India, the sources observe. For example, Disney is known to commission market and audience studies, do previews, and check feedback before investing and going ahead with series or movies. 
 In comparison, initiatives at Hotstar are driven by its senior leadership’s gut feel, according to sources  Tech in Asia  spoke to. Rollouts are often done ad hoc, and strategy pivots are common when things go awry. The company culture is particularly fraught because millions have been invested and time is running out due to intense competition, they add. 
 Hotstar dominates India’s crowded video-streaming market, thanks to its lead over rivals. That’s despite a drop in downloads: The Indian Premier League (IPL), a money-spinning cricket juggernaut with a fanatical following in the country, has been postponed indefinitely because of Covid-19.

 Most of its viewers signed up because of the IPL. Hotstar got the rights in 2017 to stream games globally after its parent Star India paid US$2.55 billion for broadcast and streaming rights through 2022. 
 That helped Hotstar notch a world record for simultaneously streaming to 25.3 million users for the quarter that ended in June 2019,  said Disney  in an earnings call. Monthly users averaged more than 300 million from April to June last year, the company added. 
 But that success came at a price. 
 Star India’s about US$60 million loss for the June 2019-ended quarter weighed on Disney’s earnings for the first time since the results of the two companies were consolidated. Star’s results were “well below our expectations,” Christine McCarthy, Disney’s chief financial officer, told analysts at the time. That loss has more than tripled for the whole of last year. 
 
   All numbers are in billions of US dollars  Source: AceEquity 
 
 The losses were mostly due to the cost of rights to the IPL and Cricket World Cup, she said. “Revenue growth was more than offset by the incremental rights expense,” she added. But the high cost of cricket content is unlikely to go away till 2022, say former and current Hotstar employees. An independent media analyst that  Tech in Asia  spoke to agrees with their assessment. 
 The price made sense at the time, when India was poised to be one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. But that changed after a series of policy missteps by the Indian government such as  demonetization  and a global economic slowdown. 
 Covid-19 has exacerbated the situation at Hotstar. Apart from putting the brakes on IPL, the production of new series and movies is also on hold because of India’s strict social distancing rules. This has hurt advertising revenue, according to sources, and there’s no clarity if insurance will cover the loss. 
 Dated content like reruns of movies, variety shows and family novellas aren’t helping the OTT streamer with new users, a current Hotstar employee says. More than half of the 4,000 plus streaming subscribers  polled by Counterpoint Research  in 2019  cited  a lack of good and fresh content as a reason for unsubscribing. 
 Tangled market 
 Hotstar’s troubles come as global media majors slug it out in a winner-takes-all battle for eyeballs in a country with  one of the world’s largest youth populations . The promise of conquering the Indian market and getting people hooked onto their service is prompting many players to throw caution to the wind and burn millions to generate or syndicate new content. 
 “Nearly 20% of the world’s population lives in India,” says Tristan Veale, an analyst at UK-based researcher Futuresource Consulting. An existing “strong” culture of video consumption and paying for TV presents a “huge” market opportunity, he says. That has been further stoked by  cheap 4G plans  from mobile network provider Jio, he adds. 
 Disney needs to quickly make the call on strategy for Hotstar to survive the battle, sources observe. While Disney would prefer focusing on subscriptions to reduce the vagaries of advertising spends, pivoting from an advertisement-led strategy is risky in an untested market, some Hotstar employees say. 
 Disney also needs to figure out how much it will spend in the country to compete against fellow heavyweights such as Amazon and Netflix, which are  investing  roughly US$700 million in total to create original and syndicated content. Amazon’s low US$13 annual fee, which in India covers the free shipping of products, also helped it gain 16 million Prime subscribers in 2019, estimates Futuresource. 
 These international firms are compelled to keep prices low due to the sheer glut of streaming platforms in a still nascent market. India has more than 40 providers vying for dominance, but none of them are profitable, according to Veale. 
 Though they’re not making money, many platforms have proliferated in the hopes that subscriber revenue will eventually pay for content costs. 
 Still in the woods 
 Apart from domestic rivals, Hotstar also faces competition from global tech titans. Before  Star India doubled down  on the IPL streaming rights, it had to fend off Facebook, which placed a bid of US$600 million in 2017. 
 The move was a “warning shot,” indicating that Facebook was “coming at sport,” media mogul Rupert Murdoch said in an interview to the Fox Business Network. And indeed, the social media behemoth has been steadily  building  its war chest to secure streaming rights to the world’s big-ticket sporting events. “Sports are inherently social, with the power to build and connect communities around the world,” Facebook’s head of sports  said  
in 2017. 
 Facebook also upped the ante by  naming  former Hotstar CEO Ajit Mohan as a vice-president and managing director for India. Mohan was a key member of the team that built the OTT company into a market leader, and many Hotstar executives have departed since then. 
 A fairytale ending? 
 Notwithstanding the problems at Hotstar, Disney will have to fix them, given how India now accounts for 16% of Disney+ subscribers and how the numbers keep on growing. 
 India will have the third-highest number of streaming video-on-demand subscribers globally after China and the US by year-end, says Futuresource. The country is also expected to have 95 million such subscribers in 2023 from 11 million users in 2018. 
 Of the 50 million paying users for Disney+ five months into the launch, 8 million were from India, the company said on April 8. But it didn’t clarify how many of them were new and not existing Hotstar subscribers,  according  to some analysts. 
 Disney’s plans are relatively  more affordable  compared to its competitors. An all-in plan that gives access to Disney+ originals and latest U.S. shows from premium TV networks HBO and Showtime as well as broadcaster Fox costs US$20 a year in India. A limited content subscription costs US$5.24 annually. 
 YouTube and Amazon’s subscription plans start at around US$2 a month while Netflix charges about US$6.55. Apple charges US$1.30. 
 If Disney can sustain its pricing, it would be able to capitalize on Hotstar’s lead.

 Revenue from such services would be a little over half a trillion US dollars by 2022, marking a huge jump from US$30.4 billion in 2017, reports consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). 
 Hotstar’s “compelling entertainment library” would help keep users loyal and reduce churn, says Futuresource’s Veale. Hosting Disney and Fox movies as well as exclusive streaming deals for India with HBO and Showtime should be a boost as well, he says. 
 Streaming service operators need scale to operate profitably, contends Veale. “The enormous population of India means that scale is certainly achievable.” ",Kenan Machado,0,7,"[(0, 0.7475678), (2, 0.028310256), (3, 0.22409624)]","['Veale', 'Disney', 'app', 'OTT', 'Fox', 'Hotstar', 'Star', 'IPL', 'Netflix', 'Facebook', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers', 'Amazon', 'Futuresource', 'Apple']","['US', 'Hotstar', 'Asia', 'IPL', 'UK', 'India', 'China']"
645462,Singapore companies rally together to support vulnerable communities,"    
 About 100,000 care packs are being assembled in Ninja Van’s warehouse, which will be delivered to vulnerable communities in Singapore as part of the #SGPAYSITFORWARD campaign. 
 Launched today, the initiative aims to encourage people to purchase a pay-it-forward care pack to help these communities strengthen their defense against Covid-19 so they can focus on other aspects of life during these trying times. 
 Each care pack will cost SG$25 and contain essential items like hand sanitizer, vitamin C tablets, antibacterial wipes, and surgical masks. With the campaign’s launch, Singaporeans will be able to purchase the packs from the  #SGPAYSITFORWARD website , which will then be delivered to migrant workers, low-income families, senior citizens, and people with special needs. 
 These groups were identified with the help of Sim Ann, Singapore’s senior minister of state for communications and information, as well as Carousell, Young NTUC, SG Youth Action Plan panel members, the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and the National Youth Council. 
 Led by Ninja Van and production company Night Owl Cinematics, #SGPAYSITFORWARD was conceptualized and executed in just a week, garnering strong support from a list of Singapore-headquartered companies like Carousell, Castlery, Love Bonito, ShopBack, as well as local media companies Goodstuph and SGAG.  Tech in Asia  is also proud to partner with them to spread awareness for this cause. 
 All proceeds will go to funding the provision, fulfilment, and island-wide delivery of these care packs. The initiative will run from today until the 100,000 care packs are sold out.

645431,"Despite having big-name backers, these Chinese firms didn’t survive Covid-19"," The Covid-19 outbreak has created unprecedented difficulties for China’s economy, with regulators halting businesses and events and telling people to stay home. While large, established companies were better prepared to weather the financial impact, some startups were especially vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic. 
 Although backed by China’s tech titans such as Alibaba, JD.com, Meituan, and Trip.com, several Chinese startups have failed to make it to the next spring and have instead shut down.

 Wujiang Hotels, a hotel chain backed by China’s largest online travel agency Trip.com, announced on March 27 this year that it will suspend operations due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and terminate all employee contracts on April 30, 2020. 
 Wujiang’s chairman, Ma Xiaodong, said in an internal announcement that since the Chinese New Year, the entire tourism and travel industry has been ravaged by the global health crisis. This has disrupted the firm’s plans for future development and has rendered his company unable to sustain operations, he added. 
 Founded in 2019, Wujiang had a registered capital of US$30 million after a strategic investment from Trip.com. Targeting the mid-level and premium hotel markets, Wujiang had assembled five hotel brands covering eight cities, including Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chongqing, and Guilin, with room prices ranging from 200 yuan (US$28.28) to over 1,000 yuan (US$141) per night. 
 Other than newly founded Wujiang, some older companies in the travel industry have also been forced to shut down. 
 Backed by Chinese internet giant Alibaba, Chinese outbound travel service provider Baicheng declared bankruptcy in late February. The 20-year-old company announced that it was unable to stay afloat due to deteriorating cash flow, as almost all of its income sources have evaporated. 
 Founded in 2000, Beijing-based Baicheng provided travel services such as airplane tickets and hotel booking, visa processing, and sightseeing packages. Alibaba participated in the company’s US$20 million series B financing round in 2014, according to enterprise data provider Tianyancha. 
 In April 2016, Baicheng was listed on the National Equity Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) – also known as the New Third Board – which is designed for innovative startups focusing on high-growth micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. However, Baicheng only remained listed on the NEEQ for three years. 
 Companies in other sectors have also been forced to shut down. JD.com-backed Meili Auto, a secondhand car financial services platform, announced that it has terminated contracts with its employees and ceased operations on March 16. The company said the outbreak made it difficult to resume normal operations, adding that, due to cash shortage, affected workers will only receive minimum wage for January and February. 
 Meili Auto, which was founded in 2014, focuses on helping individuals obtain used car loans from traditional financial institutions. JD Digits, the fintech arm of JD.com, made a strategic investment in this company in April 2016. 
 The firm once intended to list on the New York Stock Exchange and submitted a prospectus to the US Securities Regulatory Commission on October 31, 2019. However, only half a month later, the company was subjected to a predatory lending investigation affecting its founder Liu Yannan, along with multiple senior executives,  Caixin  reported. 
 Meituan Open Services, the cloud computing arm of China’s on-demand service giant Meituan Dianping, also announced on March 12 that it will terminate the service and user support for its public cloud service on May 31,  KrAsia  wrote. The company said the termination is due to a “business adjustment,” without revealing further details. 
 Meituan first launched the service in 2013 to offer cloud computing solutions for companies, focusing on the catering, hotel, and travel industries. The unit was then spun off in 2015. 
 The food delivery giant itself reported a gloomy outlook for the first quarter of 2020 and expected negative year-over-year revenue growth and an operating loss for the quarter, as the food delivery business also faces significant challenges on both the demand side and supply side, the company said in its latest financial report. 
 However, as China slowly recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, industries like robotics, education technology, supply chain logistics, and frontier technologies have continued to receive investment, showing that venture capital and fundraising in China’s dynamic startup ecosystem remains resilient.

645425,Ruangguru CEO resigns as special adviser to Jokowi," 
  Ruangguru  CEO and co-founder Belva Devara has resigned from his position as a special staffer to Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo.

 “I have delivered my resignation in the form of a letter to the president on 15 April 2020, and told him directly on 17 April 2020,” Devara announced in an open letter shown on his  Instagram account  on late Tuesday. “It is hard for me to take the decision because I don’t intend to create polemics on the assumption or public perception about my position as a presidential special staffer.” 
 Ruangguru’s participation as one of the  digital platform partners in the pre-employment card program  has sparked public criticism. The program has a budget of 20 trillion rupiah (US$1.2 billion) and is expected to have 5.6 million participants. 
 In the letter, Devara explains that the verification process for the pre-employment card program has followed applicable regulations and that there was no conflict of interest. Pre-employment cardholders can directly choose for themselves which learning platform they want. 
 Bhima Yudhistira, an economist at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance, welcomed Devara’s decision. 
 “I appreciate the resignation of Belva Devara from his role as special staffer, which shows his responsibility for running his business professionally. Belva has demonstrated that millennials need to own integrity and avoid conflict of interest,” Yudhistira said. 
  November 2019 appointment   
 Devara had been chosen by President Widodo as one of his special staffers in November 2019 to formulate the concept of pre-employment cards and instill the nation’s ideology – Pancasila. He didn’t step down as Ruangguru’s CEO when appointed to the State Palace. Other startup CEOs involved as millennial special staffers were Andi Taufan Garuda, founder of fintech lender Amartha, and Putri Tanjung, co-founder of Creativepreneur. 
 Backed by General Atlantic, GGV Capital, UOB Venture Management, and East Ventures, Ruangguru is one of Indonesia’s most prominent edtech startups. Founded by Devara and Iman Usman in 2013, Ruangguru has more than 13 million users and 4,000 employees, including teachers. 
 Recently, Ruangguru launched a platform called Skill Academy by Ruangguru, offering technical and soft skills for professionals and citizens, including pre-employment cardholders. It is one of eight digital platforms that have been chosen by the government to provide online training for job seekers.

645418,Early Gojek backer Northstar Group hits first close of fifth fund," Singapore-headquartered private equity firm  Northstar Group  announced the first close of its fifth flagship fund, representing about a third of its US$800 million target in total commitments. 
 The company said that it has already received backing for Northstar Equity Partners V from a wide range of investors, including sovereign wealth funds, insurance firms, institutional investors, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals.

 With the new fund, Northstar plans to continue investing in mature growth companies as well as select early-stage opportunities. It will be focused on Indonesia and, to a lesser extent, other countries in Southeast Asia. 
 Northstar V’s core investment themes will focus on consumers, financial services, the digital economy, and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, the firm said in a statement. 
 Patrick Walujo, co-founder and managing partner at Northstar, noted that Indonesia and other Southeast Asian markets offer strong medium- to long-term investment opportunities, as they are expected to see continued growth over the coming years. 
 “This growth will be driven by favorable demographics, increasing wealth and consumption, greater levels of education, and further digitization,” Walujo added. 
 Since being founded in 2003, the firm has backed more than 30 companies in the region across a number of industries. Some of its notable investments include Gojek, real estate brokerage firm APAC Realty, and convenience store brand Indomaret. 
 One of its latest investments came early this year when it led the  US$20 million  series A round of Indonesian edtech startup Zenius. 
 Northstar said it now manages over US$2 billion in assets under management. It closed its first fund in 2006 at US$110 million, followed by a US$285 million fund in 2008. Then, the company raised US$820 million in 2011 and US$810 million in 2014 for its third and fourth funds, respectively.

645400,Facebook invests $5.7b in Indian digital services giant Jio," Facebook announced that it has invested US$5.7 billion in Jio Platforms Limited, the digital services subsidiary of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), making Facebook its largest minority shareholder.

 The official announcement follows reports that said the social media giant was looking at acquiring  a 10% stake  in Jio to expand in India’s digital market. 
 “India is in the midst of one of the most dynamic social and economic transformations the world has ever seen […],” Facebook said in a statement. “In just the past five years, more than 560 million people in India have gained access to the internet.” 
 The company now aims to open new opportunities for Indian businesses, with a focus on the 60 million small businesses that account for the majority of jobs in the country. 
 With the collaboration, Facebook and Jio will focus on creating new ways for people and companies to operate in the digital economy. For instance, JioMart, RIL’s small-business initiative, can be integrated with Facebook’s messaging app WhatsApp to enable people to connect with firms and purchase products through mobile. 
 Just a few days ago, it was reported that Facebook was in talks with RIL to create a  WeChat-like super app  that combines features like social, digital payments, gaming, and flight and hotel bookings, among others. 
 Last year, RIL announced Jio Platforms as an umbrella platform for all its digital initiatives, including Reliance Jio. In less than four years, Reliance Jio has become a competitive player in the local telco space and brought more than 388 million people online. 
 Aside from India, Facebook also set its eyes on Indonesia. The internet giant is said to be in early discussions with  local fintech startups  GoPay, Ovo, and LinkAja for a potential mobile payments project in the archipelago.

645275,US fintech firm SoFi acquires Hong Kong stock trading app 8 Securities,"  SoFi , a US-based online personal finance company, today announced that it has acquired Hong Kong-based mobile stock trading startup  8 Securities , which will now be rebranded as SoFi Hong Kong. 
 The acquisition marks SoFi’s first international foothold outside of the US, according to a statement. 
 Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.

 With the acquisition, SoFi Hong Kong claims it will become the only brokerage service that delivers free stock trading of over 15,000 US and Kong Kong stocks, as well as exchange-traded funds. It charges zero commissions, platform fees, and custodian fees. 
 Through the platform, members will be able to follow the investment portfolios of top-performing members of the community and learn what they are buying, selling, and holding. They will also see where their own performance ranks. 
 “We underwent an extensive process in considering our initial expansion into an international market, and it quickly became clear that Hong Kong, a financial capital of Asia, is ripe for innovation,” said Anthony Noto, the CEO of SoFi. 
 Launched in 2012, 8 Securities offered mobile-only investing, a robo-advisory service, a social trading platform, and zero-commission brokerage. It raised a total of US$70 million in funding, with a  US$25 million  round in 2018 from Japanese investment bank Nomura. Focusing on Asia, most of its users are in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Singapore. 
 According to Mikaal Abdulla, the co-founder of 8 Securities, the deal is part of SoFi’s strategy to grow across Asia and Europe. Recently, SoftBank-backed SoFi acquired Galileo, a US-based payments firm, to distribute white-label investing, savings, and lending products to business-to-business customers. 
 Established in 2011, it also offers student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, mortgage, and insurance. Last year, it raised over US$500 million in a funding round led by Qatar Investment Authority, giving it a pre-money valuation of US$4.3 billion.

645362,The long and winding road to recovery has begun," Dear readers, 
 There are positive signs emerging from this pandemic. 
 On Sunday, South Korea slightly  relaxed lockdown guidelines , allowing high-risk facilities such as churches to reopen, while sports matches such as soccer can resume without an audience. Social distancing measures will be extended for another 16 days even as Covid-19 infections in the country subside. 
 Earlier this month, China  lifted the lockdown inWuhan , the city where the viral disease began.  In Europe , Germany allowed businesses to reopen, while Spain has recorded fewer deaths.

 Despite these encouraging trends, it will take some time for the economy and businesses to recover from the recession triggered by this global crisis. China recorded its  first economic contraction in at least three decades  in the first quarter as the novel coronavirus shut down factories and shopping malls and left thousands jobless. 
 With China in the doldrums, it will be an uphill battle to revive the global economy despite the stimulus measures that governments are doling out. 
 “The global economy is still under great pressure at the moment,” says Bernard Aw, Singapore-based principal economist at IHS Markit. “With some countries extending their anti-virus measures, global demand is expected to be dampened further.” 
 Consumer demand will remain tepid amid rising retrenchments and the specter of further layoffs in the horizon. Hundreds were laid off last week across Southeast Asia’s  online lending industry . At the same time, these startups have  turned cautious with lending activities  amid concerns that consumers and businesses won’t be able to repay loans as the economy worsens. 
 Still, it’s not all bad news. For instance,  social commerce in Indonesia is gaining momentum , with startups seeing strong demand as most people stay at home and buy their daily necessities online. Businesses are also  becoming creative  as they adapt and cope with this crisis.

 ABOUT 
 Consumers in Singapore are optimistic about the country’s recovery from Covid-19, even as they grow more concerned about the pandemic, according to a recent survey conducted by  Circles Life.   
 More than half of the respondents think the crisis will “die down” within a month, and an overwhelming majority are confident in how the Singapore government has handled the situation. 
 The optimism stands out because more than half of respondents also said that their income has been affected to some extent. 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
 Businesses are counting on consumers to spend again as soon as Covid-19 dies down. But the reality is, its economic impact might be felt for the rest of the year, at the very least. 
 The seeming confidence of Singapore’s consumers is good news – it means they might empty their wallets once more as things go back to normal. 
 That said, Singapore remains a small consumer market. For companies with a regional interest, they might be watching Indonesia, where Covid-19 hasn’t been contained yet.

645310,Tackling the security challenges of smart cities," Smart cities are  the future of urbanization . They’ve been put forward as the way to more efficient, and sustainable living. 
 A key aspect of these cities is  smart access , which includes replacing traditional locks and keys with smart locks that can be opened using mobile phones. 
 Smart-access solutions are especially beneficial to infrastructure management businesses, such as telecommunications firms, logistics providers, and utilities companies, where multiple workers need access to various facilities across a country. 
 Knowing who has access to a location, for how long, and how frequently enables businesses to optimize workflows and assign work in the most effective manner. It is also helpful in the event of a security breach, such as theft or vandalism. 
 “With telcos, you regularly need to pass keys to people to do servicing. Every month or two, you need someone to go in to check [if] everything’s OK, and someone needs to open up the cell tower for repairs when something goes wrong,” explains Anthony Chow, CEO of  Igloohome . “The last thing you want is for the keys to go missing or end up in the wrong hands.” 
 
  Anthony Chow, CEO of Igloohome / Photo credit: Igloohome 
 
 Igloohome is a Singapore-based provider of keyless access solutions. It  started out building smart locks  for homeowners to grant access to visitors remotely by sending an access code to their smartphones. 
 In 2019, after seeing that enterprises also have the same need, it launched  Iglooworks , a platform which helps businesses solve various access-related problems. 
 With Iglooworks, a manager can remotely grant entry to a facility, allowing only specific employees to unlock the door. 
 This is done through a centralized platform, where managers can view all the different locks under their control and grant or revoke permissions to entry accordingly. 
 Such solutions enable companies to deploy staff more efficiently, as it cuts down the back-and-forth process of passing keys around and eliminates concerns about keys being mislaid. 
 Security concerns 
 Despite the advancements in smart-city technologies, they also bring along with them a world of security issues, from concerns about  data privacy  to  system vulnerabilities . 
 One of the biggest issues with smart locks, which often rely on the internet of things (IoT), is that they can be easily hacked. 
 IoT systems are some of the  most vulnerable  in the smart-city landscape, as they are usually connected to a network but are only protected by the most basic of security measures, such as passwords. 
 This provides a point of entry for hackers to infiltrate the other devices connected to the same network. 
 “This sounds very scary coming from a lockmaker, but the truth is, nothing is hack-proof,” says Chow. To ensure device security, relevant measures should be put in place to make hacking so difficult, “it becomes pointless for the hacker,” he adds. 
 Iglooworks uses a variety of different technologies and strategies to make its system as secure as possible. By using cryptographic algorithms to generate one-time passwords, together with a proprietary Bluetooth software and multi-factor authentication options, the company eliminates the need for a lock to be connected to a larger network.

 And when connectivity is required, such as with larger systems of locks, Iglooworks taps into the networks of telcos and takes advantage of the security that is built into the telecommunications system. 
 Even simple measures like locking someone out after multiple failed login attempts help keep the system secure. 
 Working with regulators 
 The use of IoT in smart-city initiatives exposes even governments to security  issues . These occur when products from different vendors with varying systems are made to work together, using intermediates like the open internet to connect everything. 
 These isolated systems have greater gaps between them, creating more opportunities for hackers. 
 As such, governments must also work together with businesses to develop regulatory frameworks that address the various concerns of smart cities, says Chow. 
 With clear guidelines in place, governments can ensure that all the different parts in a smart city work as a cohesive unit and eliminate weak points. This, in turn, assures the public that any device it uses in projects meets the necessary security requirements. 
 In Singapore, for instance, the  Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme  is being piloted to rate the security of IoT devices, with the aim of encouraging manufacturers to make security one of their priorities. 
 “The cities of tomorrow will be the ones where there is an ecosystem in place today to enable growth,” says Chow. 
 Ultimately, the security of smart cities – and their future for that matter – hinge on the cooperation between the private and public sectors. 
 
 Igloohome is a provider of keyless access solutions, bringing the convenience of smart locks to homeowners. Its new service  Iglooworks  is a platform that enables enterprises to manage access points seamlessly.

645358,This is how Indonesia’s Kargo will spend its $31m series A money," Indonesia-based freight logistics startup  Kargo Technologies  recently announced the close of its  US$31 million  series A funding round, bringing the company’s total capital raised to US$38.6 million. 
 The investment comes as the world contends with the Covid-19 pandemic, and Indonesia is struggling as hundreds of new cases are logged each day. Like many other startups, Kargo had to switch gears and make adjustments to its operations. The company originally planned to use its new funds to double down on promotions during Ramadan, the busiest time of the year for retailers in Indonesia. Now, however, Kargo is in survival mode.

 “We were going to do tons of marketing and invest more in branding to build our presence, but all of that is out the window now. For us, today, it’s how do we make sure that the company survives and truckers on our platform stay busy,” Kargo CEO Tiger Fang told  KrAsia  in a recent interview. 
 Ramadan starts this month and will end in late May. It will be followed by the Islamic holiday Eid al-Fitr. Kargo was anticipating a threefold jump as Indonesia’s shipping volume usually swells significantly during these holidays. 
 However, because the government instructed people in Indonesia to remain in their residences, the company adjusted its expectations. “Many of our trucking partners are small companies, so our biggest focus is to make sure that everyone survives. That is why we are seeding a US$1 million relief fund to support our truckers,” Fang said. 
 The other major challenge for logistics companies during the pandemic, according to the entrepreneur, is that there will likely be a nosedive in demand for freight transportation. Firms that handle cargo for import and export deliveries or work with hotels and restaurants may see fewer shipments, which could lead to truck drivers being out of jobs. Therefore, Kargo’s relief fund and similar initiatives will be crucial to ensure that essential supplies will reach their destinations during this critical time. 
 All of Kargo’s employees are contributing a portion of their salaries to the relief fund. Some senior staff are taking pay cuts of up to 75%, while Fang himself is donating his entire salary for the next 12 months. Kargo also welcomes all organizations in need of a logistics partner to get in touch via its relief fund portal. 
 Looking inward, Kargo has slashed perks at the workplace to make sure their expenditure is as lean as possible. “We are very lucky because we now have over US$30 million in our bank account, but we don’t want to take this crisis lightly and we need to save up,” Fang said.

 Kargo was founded in 2018 by Fang and Yodi Aditya, who serves as the company’s chief technology officer. By then, the pair had already cut their teeth within the spheres of Southeast Asia’s tech scene. Aditya had previously established another logistics tech startup, while Fang was one of Uber’s earliest employees in Southeast Asia, launching its operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Before Uber, Fang worked at Lazada as the company’s managing director, leading the firm’s commercial developments in Thailand and Vietnam.

 When Fang was involved in Uber’s delivery service experiment in Surabaya, he realized that there is a massive demand for digitized trucking and logistics services. 
 Indonesia’s trucking industry is worth about US$250 billion, and logistics costs count for around 25% of Indonesia’s GDP. The sector is in need of streamlining, and Kargo is doing just that by providing a platform that enables shippers, transporters, and truckers to connect, transact, and track shipments. The central idea is to create a transparent and accountable supply chain. 
 Entering its second year of operation, Kargo now has over 5,000 shippers and 10,000 registered trucking companies on its platform, giving them access to about 50,000 trucks. Most of Kargo’s business comes from major fast-moving consumer goods enterprises such as Coca-Cola, Unilever, and Mayora. It also serves small businesses and works with major logistics companies like DHL. 
 “Fifty thousand trucks only make up less than 1% of all the trucks in Indonesia, so the market and opportunity is still wide open, and we want to have the biggest trucking network in the country,” said Fang. 
 Despite recent challenges, the Covid-19 pandemic has also brought new opportunities for Kargo. The company is currently working with several charitable institutions, like crowdfunding platform Kita Bisa, to deliver meals and essential medical supplies to healthcare workers and patients at multiple Jakarta hospitals. 
 “I have worked for several years in China, and through my connections, we are able to source some equipment. The supplies will be delivered in containers within 10 days and our container trucks will pick them up at the port,” said Fang. “Before this, we never really thought about supporting import and export activities, but now we are looking at this new opportunity.” 
 Kargo is exploring other lines of business as well. Right now, as many transporters and drivers are struggling with diminished incomes, the company is offering them loans in partnership with financial institutions. “This is something we started sprinting on very recently, and we obviously want to work with the right partners, including companies that can help us with assessing credit risk,” Fang said. 
 Looking ahead, Kargo wants to expand its business beyond Indonesia and become a global partner for its customers. The company has logged good unit economics and positive cash flow so far. Even though its shipping volume has dipped due to the pandemic, the company is optimistic about reaching a sustainable operational level soon. 
 “With this crisis, we’ll see which companies have the right business model, operations, and executions. This is a real test for all of us, and we, at Kargo, have never been more focused on our mission to make sure that critical supplies are not interrupted,” Fang said.

645307,"Covid-19 be damned, Asia’s top VC says it’s open for business"," Covid-19 has brought many businesses to a standstill. But one of Asia’s most active venture capitalists says it’s still making investments and actively evaluating new deals. 
 “We are definitely open for business,” Abheek Anand, a Singapore-based managing director at Sequoia Capital India, tells  Tech in Asia  in an exclusive interview. “The world is not shutting down.”

 By plowing money into businesses at a time when others are reluctant to sign checks, Sequoia is hoping to get ahead of the market. The venture capitalist hopes its investee companies will scale up and be ready to seize opportunities when markets recover to offer an exit. 
 “Sometimes, the best companies get created in tough times,” says Anand. 
 He thinks that early-stage companies are fairly valued, and he’s not necessarily looking for bargains. “The best companies always have access to capital, even in very tough times,” he observes. 
 Sequoia India continuously looks for “quality businesses in large markets” that are run by “exceptional” founders. “Such companies are always priced fairly.” 
 And just like many companies, Sequoia is making up for the inability to travel and meet startups personally during this time of lockdowns and enhanced quarantine measures by organizing virtual meetings and listening to startup pitches online. 
 Dealmaking is “happening full steam,” Anand says. 
 Sequoia was one of the top venture capital investors in the region this year. It participated in 34 capital raises of about US$3.4 billion through March this year, as shown in  Tech in Asia ’s analysis of publicly available funding data. Tencent was the biggest investor by value between January and March, joining in fundraises totalling US$3.7 billion. Sequoia Capital was second, with fundraises totalling US$3.36 billion. 
 
  Ranking based on number of deals in the first quarter. Source:  Tech in Asia  
 
 Sequoia’s involvement in the first quarter of this year’s largest deals included Chinese online real estate broker Beike Zhaofang,  gold-backed lender Rupeek , and  bike rental startup Bounce . The VC firm also invested in Indonesian unicorn Gojek as well as  Indian edtech companies  such as Byju’s, InterviewBit, and Doubtnut. 
 First up, though, Anand wants to buy into companies that would likely benefit from the social distancing rules being implemented by governments around the world. 
 “There are some tailwinds in sectors that are counter-cyclical in this market,” he says. “These include edtech, entertainment, gaming, remote work, digital products (e.g., software-as-a service), and essential consumer services.” 
 Anand declined to say how much cash Sequoia India has on hand and how many deals the firm would likely close in the next three months. 
 “We have done a lot of analysis of our portfolio companies, and many of them are very well-funded. Many of them will survive,” he notes. “The ones that are going to find it tough, we obviously will try and support as much as we can.” Sequoia India has capital to deploy but wants to do it in a “prudent manner.” 
 Most companies in Sequoia India’s  Southeast Asia portfolio  are making money. “A substantial percentage of our series A, series B, and series C partnerships have been in companies that are already profitable,” he adds. 
 Turn profitable or perish 
 Anand’s comments come as startups find it  difficult to raise capital , and the Covid-19 pandemic isn’t helping. Famed Silicon Valley venture capitalists such as  Hadley Harris  are vocal about investors willing to hear out startups seeking fresh funding. 
 “I keep hearing VCs say they’re ‘fully open for business’ for new investments. Founders should know that is very likely a pile of poo,” the founding general partner of Eniac Ventures said via  Twitter . 
 
 I keep hearing VC’s say they’re “fully open for business” for new investments. Founders should know that is very likely 💩. If they’ve been investing for years they’re likely spending the mass majority of their time with portfolio companies. If they’re not, that’s a real red flag

 A dearth of cash led SoftBank-backed satellite internet provider OneWeb  to file for bankruptcy  last month, and many startups in the travel industry are taking  tough measures  to extend their runways all the way through 2022 to survive this pandemic-induced recession.

 While the bar has been set higher for fundraising, Anand says it’s crucial for startups to stop hemorrhaging cash. “At this point, cash is king. If you have less than 12 months of cash, then move to a cash budget.” 
 He also points out that startup founders need to take stock of the actual cash they have and find ways to reduce outgoing expenses such as rent and vendor payments. “If your people are not going to the office, try to negotiate rental discounts with landlords.” 
 Companies should also try and take advantage of available government support, such as promises to pay the salaries for those that don’t lay off employees. 
 The unkindest cut 
 For startups in developing countries, founders could consider taking pay cuts for themselves and the senior management team to soften the blow to employees at the lowest rung, suggests Anand. This move would also help foster a culture that endears a company to its staff. 
 If a founder is unable to do that, then ensuring that the size of layoffs is appropriate for the business and is not spread across multiple rounds would help, he adds. 
 Anand’s advice comes as legacy and startup companies struggle to deal with the near-cessation of business as they’ve known it. To raise money, most startups bank on the promise of upending legacy industries and scaling quickly through growth. Usually, the next step in such plans is to go public and make investors foot the bill for unprofitable growth. But after US co-working operator WeWork’s  failed initial public offering  and the  ensuing debacle , that option quickly evaporated. This led to a global pivot to profitability, with other prominent names such as Indian hospitality startup Oyo  struggling  to keep pace. 
 “In times of uncertainty, you need to have enough visibility into survival before you thrive,” says Anand. That means having at least 12 months of runway, if not longer. “We are definitely pushing all our companies to make sure they have that covered.” 
 Recently, Singapore-based budget hotel startup RedDoorz  said  that Covid-19 has “drastically affected” business. Founder Amit Saberwal told  Tech in Asia  that the company has extended its runway to last into 2022. 
 Anand agrees with this approach, citing a Sequoia portfolio company that recently completed a funding round as an example. Its original plan was to use that money for 18 months, but now, the company founder is looking to make those funds last for 30 months instead. “And that is being extremely careful. [It’s like] saying, ‘I’m in a fortunate position to be able to raise a lot of money right now, and I want to make sure it lasts a lot longer.’” 
 Pivot, pivot, pivot 
 Decisions that help the company make profits or come close towards profitability need to be made soon. 
 “We are encouraging all our companies to use this time to make tough decisions,” Anand says, since businesses now only have “a few weeks” to make them instead of a few years. Those choices could include changing the business model, cutting fixed costs, and even raising prices. 
 Startups also need to make sure that they have a viable economic model for the company. In the past, a lot of companies kept raising capital. “They’d say, ‘It’s OK – I will figure it out over time. Let the operating leverage kick in, then I will get to scale and become profitable.’ [But] that option has suddenly become a lot harder,” observes Anand. 
 The downturn stemming from Covid-19 comes as investors in high-growth startups are seeking to reduce cash burns. One of their options has been to explore partnerships between rivals to address fierce competition. 
 As such, consolidation might become a possibility in the wake of this global crisis, according to Anand. “The reality is that capital markets are going to be a little constrained.” 
 Personal distress 
 Along with the economic fallout, the pandemic has brought unforeseen personal and professional distress to people. With schools and offices closed, working from home has been particularly difficult for parents. Amidst the pressure, Anand advocates taking the time to focus on oneself. 
 “Focus on your health, your family. We’re telling all of our co-workers and all the founders in our portfolio companies to do that.” Despite the bleak circumstances, people need to try and see the opportunities, he adds. “The biggest thing that people sometimes don’t do enough of is to take enough risks, and these types of situations force us to do risky things.” 
 Losing a job, for example, could push people to try something different sooner than they would have otherwise. “Think of your career not in [terms of] what happens in the next year or so, but what happens in 10-year increments.” ",Kenan Machado,0,7,"[(0, 0.762306), (2, 0.14126703), (3, 0.0963979)]","['VC', 'InterviewBit', 'Twitter', 'RedDoorz', 'Anand', 'SoftBank']","['US', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'Byju', 'India', 'Anand', 'Tech']"
645206,"How Alibaba survived restructuring, SARS: A chat with its former president and COO"," Very few people knew or could remember what Alibaba looked like in 2001. 
 It had an unprofitable local yellow page business that it managed around the world. Its corporate account only had US$10 million left and was burning US$2 million every month. 
 These were the circumstances when Savio Kwan arrived in Hangzhou after 17 years at General Electric, one of the best companies anyone could work for back then. Alongside Jack Ma and his co-founder Joe Tsai, Kwan managed to cut down Alibaba’s cost to US$500,o00 per month and bought it a runway of 18 months to figure out a new business model. 
 During this time, Ma managed to lead the business into profitability with a cross-border business-to-business listing platform that helps small and medium-sized enterprises in China sell overseas.

 This not only helped Alibaba weather the SARS crisis later on, but the culture it had built between 2001 and 2002 laid the foundation for its future growth in its product lines Taobao, Alipay, Tmall, and Alibaba Cloud. In the company’s current astonishing  US$559 billion  market cap, the original B2B listing business (Alibaba.com) accounts for less than 3%. 
 In a recent webinar that GGV Capital did for entrepreneurs navigating Covid-19, I spent an hour with Kwan and asked him how he turned Alibaba’s operations around, maneuvered through SARS, and set up the unique Alibaba culture. 
 Here’s an edited version of that night’s conversation. You can listen to the full episode  here  and watch the recorded video  here . 
 Disclosure: Kwan is an old friend of GGV Capital. GGV was very fortunate to be able to become an investor in Alibaba 17 years ago. We met Kwan back in 2003, and my partners Jixun and Jenny have spent quite a bit of time with him since. 
  Soon after you joined Alibaba, you realized that the company only had about five months of cash flow left. How did you and your team put together a strategy to overcome that?  
 This is actually one of the defining moments of my career. The company had about US$10 million, but the burn rate was US$2 million per month. We – Jack, Joe, [Alibaba’s former chief technology officer] John [Wu], and I – quickly huddled together and came up with a cohesive strategy. We called it “three B2C.” This stood for three things: back to China, back to coast, and back to central. Essentially, we had to pick where we were going to fight our last battle for survival. 
 Very quickly, we closed down all overseas offices and scaled down to around 150 personnel. It was important to do all these within 30 days because if we hadn’t done that, it would have meant another month, another burn rate of a few million dollars. 
 All we did back then can be translated into the phrase “last man standing.” Do not die, do not give up. 
  How did you tell the employees that you were letting them go?  
 I knew it was going to be really hard, so I asked a favor from Jack. I said, “Jack, for the next 30 days, please do not answer any mobile [calls] from any of our employees because everybody’s going to ask you to spare them.” I had to cut branches to restructure quickly, and Jack agreed to this and kept his promise very well. 
 I remember, before going to our US office to deliver the news, my wife packed my suitcase and asked, “Are you going to the US to fire people?” I said yes. And she said, “Do I need to pack a bulletproof vest for you?” 
 I thought she was joking. But there had actually been a financial services company that was doing restructuring, and a disgruntled guy went back to the office to kill the HR director, his boss, and himself in the end. So those were the kinds of things that we actually saw. 
 Joe and I went there quickly, and we talked to all 40 of them and made sure all of them knew their contract. We did the right thing, we paid up whatever the contract said, and we made an offer to anybody who wanted to take stock instead of cash compensation. 
 We did this really quickly, and then we went back to China and cut all the offices outside the coastal area – Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangzhou, Fujian, and Shandong – and left only Beijing and Shanghai. We cut from 360 people to 150 after 30 days, but we were down to half a million burn a month and left with US$9 million after restructuring. 
  How were you able to cut staff without demoralizing the remaining team?  
 First, we were very clear from the start that we wanted to preserve our opportunities in China. So, if you’re not within that operation, you know you are vulnerable. 
 Second, we were very candid with everybody. We did not hide anything. I remember telling our engineers in Silicon Valley that we could not support the operations anymore. And then you have to honor their contracts, give the people you laid off what’s due to them, don’t try to argue. You have to help them, and you have to give them everything you can afford. 
 The last thing was speed. We did all of this in one go. You do not want death by a thousand cuts. 
  With the extended runway, what did you do on revenue and strategy to make a difference so that you were able to raise a very sizable round from SoftBank after 18 months?  
 After we did the restructuring, we were able to report to the board that we stopped the burn and that we have 18 months. It was good news, but we still did not have a [profitable] business model after the board meeting. 
 Joe, Jack, and I started a deep discussion on whether we should give bribes or not, and decided that we must not, which led to the closure of business lines that needed to give bribes. [We] eventually decided to try one last business line that we hadn’t tried [yet], which was to help SMEs who were trying to export and find buyers from overseas. 
 We suddenly realized that it is not the company we [should be] helping; we should be helping the bosses of those companies. And when you do that, there’s no bribe needed, which had been a major concern for us. Once we did that, it actually gave us the business model and gave us the B2B business. 
 Company owners don’t put money from [their] left pocket to [their] right pocket, so that is actually what sustained us. That business grew up to a billion US dollars. And that is where we have the cash flow to support Taobao, Alipay, and so on. 
  In between 2001 to 2003, what kind of people-related initiatives did you implement that, in hindsight, prepared Alibaba for SARS?  
 For me, it started with something close to Jack’s heart, and those are Alibaba’s company values. 
 This was an exercise in itself: We spent seven hours debating and refining what Jack saw as Alibaba’s company values, and we finally got it down to nine company values. Putting this into action, we decided that we were going to do performance evaluations. 
 In Alibaba, you could be in sales, [in engineering], or in HR. So, 50% of your measurement is [based] on performance, but the other 50% will be measured [by] your behavior vis-a-vis our company values. 
 The other key thing we did was a lot of training and development for everybody. Most people think that new employee training should be for three to four hours [only]; our training for new employees happens offline for two to four weeks. We make sure everybody understands the company’s values, vision, mission, and expected behavior. 
 In times of crisis like SARS, our employees were actually empowered to navigate and make decisions on their own. When faced with difficult decisions, they pulled out our company values and measured what they planned to do against them. 
  Tell us what happened when SARS hit and the steps that were taken to manage the business.  
 One of our employees who came back from the Canton trade fair exhibition at the end of 2002 ended up getting diagnosed as a suspected case of SARS. She had to get isolated – as did the rest of her team. 
 Very soon, the whole company was made to work from home, isolated from their work premises. What had happened before that was completely voluntary. People were coming to me, asking for cash for equipment to be able to work from home: telephones, broadband, laptops, mobile phones. Basically, they were telling me, “I need you to empower me to perform.” 
 Our engineers also built a platform where all telephone input into our fixed lines could be picked up anywhere. It was a virtual platform where our staff could get access to and start dealing with their customers. Any customer that called into Alibaba would get their phone call picked up. So we ensured that even in a crisis, we took care of our customers. 
  Based on your experience with SARS, what would be the key lessons that current startups can use in this climate?  
 The first thing is to go back to basics and ask what the key value proposition is. For Alibaba, it’s to make doing business easy; in Google’s case, [it’s to] make every search useful. Every company or startup founder has a dream to do something valuable for their target customer – articulate and communicate that to the team. Give your team a reason for their work. 
 In the heat of surviving this pandemic, you should stop and ask, “What are we doing here? Are we just doing things, or are we winning?” A company with a strategy knows how to win. A company without a strategy only knows how to look very busy because they do not know what they have to do to win. 
 So, the first thing: do not die. Be the last man standing, deliver value to your target customers, and figure out a strategy to win.

 Matrix Partners India and other existing investors also participated in the round.

 Founded in 2017, the Bangalore-based startup offers an AI platform to help companies manage their business trips from end to end. By using the platform, travelers could enjoy a 90-second booking experience, while companies could save up to 30% in travel budget, Itilite said. 
 The startup has 150,000 users across over 200 companies in India, the US, and Southeast Asia, including Jockey, Toshiba JSW, Ola, Swiggy, and Capillary Technologies, among others. It also said it has grown five times since it secured US$4.2 million in a series A round from Matrix Partners and others in January last year. 
 Itilite now plans to use the fresh capital to drive product innovation and accelerate its international expansion, as well as grow its clientele in existing markets. 
 For the company, the timing of the funding indicates that the investor community has confidence in digitally transforming the business travel industry. 
 “Travel fuels growth of any business, and despite being one of their largest expenditures, it is also the most under-optimized function,” said Anish Khadiya, chief business officer at Itilite. 
 The company said that while it has recorded a temporary decline in revenue, it has seen increased interest from companies to digitally optimize travel processes for efficiency and cost reduction, even during the pandemic. 
 Since the outbreak started, Itilite said it has introduced several features to help its customers ensure employee safety once travel resumes, such as identifying hotels that follow World Health Organization’s guidelines and listing them on the platform as “Covid-safe.” ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.99953824)]","['Swiggy', 'Itilite', 'AI', 'Ola']","['Bangalore', 'US', 'India', 'Jockey']"

 Launched in 2009, Vestiaire Collective is an online marketplace where users can buy and sell pre-owned luxury fashion items. 
 It currently has over 9 million members across 90 countries, with offices in Paris, London, New York, Milan, Berlin, and Hong Kong. Over 80% of the company’s transactions are generated cross-border, according to a statement. 
 Vestiaire said that it will explore expansion in South Korea and Japan this year, with the help of Korelya Capital, which is backed by Korean conglomerate Naver. It also looks to continue to grow in the US market. 
 The French company wants to further develop its direct shipping model, where sellers send goods to customers directly without going through the platform’s control and authentication center. 
 Launched last year, the new service has been adopted by over 50% of orders in Europe, growing at a rate of more than 60% month over month, Vestiaire said. It will be launched in the US in early summer this year, then in Asia before the end of 2020. 
 Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the company said it has seen deposits and orders rebound to the pre-outbreak baseline or even above it, which demonstrates customer demand for circular business models in the retail landscape. It expects that 20% of consumers will reduce their clothing consumption, as environmental concerns will further drive a more conscious approach to consumption. 
 “I am personally convinced that this unprecedented period of disruption will not only challenge where we shop but how we shop,” Bittner said.

 In a letter addressing the challenges brought by Covid-19, Grab’s group CEO and founder Anthony Tan said that the ride-hailing firm will undergo “necessary operational adjustments,” which includes right-sizing its costs and managing capital more efficiently, to weather the storm. 
 “Covid-19 is the single biggest crisis to affect Grab in the eight years of our existence. It has had an unprecedented impact on our operations, our business, and the livelihoods of our partners,” said Tan. Grab’s senior leaders recently took a  20% pay cut  to help the business cope. 
 The chief exec noted that in cities and countries experiencing major lockdowns, Grab has seen a sharp decline in its ride-hailing business, with volumes in some markets down by double-digit percentages. 
 Its delivery business has fared better, Tan said, as stay-at-home measures drive online food and grocery deliveries. To meet this increased demand, Grab has started expanding its daily essentials delivery service GrabMart and on-demand service GrabAssistant to more cities and countries. 
 As a result, GrabMart will be available to users in the Philippines, Myanmar, and Cambodia, while GrabAssistant will be accessible in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. The concierge service will also be relaunching in Vietnam. 
 Tan also said that Grab has also committed to spend US$40 million for relief initiatives in Southeast Asia, as it looks to support its driver- and merchant-partners during the outbreak.

 A spokesperson for the company told  Tech in Asia  that Zilingo’s current strategic direction is to focus on its core business plans in Asia and emerging markets, after recently shifting to a business-to-business model, in addition to growing its platform. 
 With this approach, the company “had to make several tough decisions,” which included letting go of part of its team, as some functions have become redundant, the spokesperson added. According to Zilingo, the restructuring measures were not taken in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, as planning had been going on for several months before the layoffs were announced. 
 Zilingo started as a Bangkok-based online marketplace in 2015. It has since expanded to offer a suite of solutions for fashion merchants, including procurement and inventory management, payments processing, as well as business financing. 
 Early last year, it raised  US$226 million  from Singaporean state-linked funds Temasek and EDBI, as well as existing backers Sequoia Capital, Burda Principal Investments, and Sofina.  Bloomberg  reported at the time that the series D raise pushed the company’s valuation to about US$970 million. 
 The company then announced in October 2019 that it planned to invest  US$100 million  to build out its fashion supply chain business in the US, after starting its operations in the country earlier that summer. Zilingo said the move was part of its accelerated growth plans in new markets such as Australia, Europe, and the Middle East.

 Bank Indonesia assistant governor Filianingsih Hendarta, who heads the payment system policy department, told  Reuters  that the three Indonesian fintech firms had previously reached out to ask about tentative approval for a payments partnership with the social media major. 
 “So far, no one submitted the formal application. Some of them just came to discuss [this] during the consultative meeting with Bank Indonesia,” she added. 
 Citing four sources familiar with the matter,  Reuters  said that Facebook looks to capitalize on the Indonesian market and is currently preparing for regulatory approval there. If the deal materializes, it could be among the company’s first such service under its unified payment service Facebook Pay, which was unveiled in November last year. 
 Without giving further information, LinkAja and Ovo separately told  Tech in Asia  that they were open to strategic partnerships with companies that share a common goal of improving financial inclusion in Indonesia. Gojek, however, declined to comment. 
  Reuters  reported in August 2019 that WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook acquired back in 2014, had been in talks with the three companies to launch digital payment services in the country. 
 “We are in conversations with partners in Indonesia. However, the discussions are ongoing and we do not have anything further to share at this stage,” a spokesperson for Facebook said at the time. 
 Indonesia is not the only country Facebook has its eyes on in Asia. Just last week, the  Economic Times  reported that the tech giant was working with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) to create and launch a  WeChat-like super app  in the country. 
 The app is expected to have features such as social, digital payments, gaming, and flight and hotel bookings, said four people familiar with the matter. 
 In March, the  Financial Times  also reported that Facebook was in talks to acquire a  10% stake  in RIL’s telco business Jio – a multibillion-dollar deal that would expand the former’s grasp in India’s digital market.

645132,Gojek acquires Indonesian POS startup Moka,"  Update (April 30, 10:30 am): This article was updated to include Gojek’s official announcement on the acquisition.  
 Indonesian tech titan Gojek has officially announced its acquisition of  Moka , a local startup that provides businesses with mobile point-of-sale solutions. It did not disclose the size of the deal. 
 According to a statement, the two companies will combine their services to provide merchants with different solutions such as payments, food delivery, POS systems, and other tools. 
 Moka, which will be integrated into Gojek’s merchant ecosystem called GoBiz, will continue to operate as a distinct brand.

 Last week, it was reported that Gojek’s management has filed a notification to Indoensia’s Business Competition Supervisory Commission (KPPU) about the acquisition. According to the KPPU website, the  notice  was delivered on April 9, signaling that the deal occurred in March. 
 Based on the Indonesian government’s regulations concerning acquisitions, the commission must be notified no longer than 30 days from a transaction’s date of effectivity. 
 In August last year, a source close to Moka told  Tech in Asia  that the company was  in talks  with Gojek on a potential deal, which was expected to be worth over US$100 million.  Bloomberg  later reported in December 2019 that the transaction was approaching its close and could have a value of around US$120 million. 
 While Moka declined to comment on the matter, the company confirmed at the time that it had partnered with GoPay to bolster its offering. The startup also supports payments through Ovo, Dana, LinkAja, Kredivo, Akulaku, and WeChat Pay. 
 Additionally, Moka has also worked with peer-to-peer lenders KoinWorks, Taralite, and Modalku to provide its merchant partners with business loans. 
 Moka started off in 2014 by replacing traditional cash registers with a cloud-based system that runs on iOS and Android devices, targeting manually run mom and pop businesses. Since then, it has expanded to offer a suite of storefront solutions, serving over 30,000 merchants across Indonesia.

 According to a statement, the strategic partnership will strengthen Pinduoduo’s position in the household appliances and electronics sector. It will also accelerate its push into the consumer-to-manufacturer space, where Pinduoduo aggregates consumer demand and preferences to help manufacturers customize their products’ designs prior to the manufacturing stage. 
 The bonds will have a coupon rate of 5% per annum and a tenure of three years, with an option to extend by two years. They are convertible at over HK$1.21 per share, which would work out to around 1.28 billion of Gome shares or a 5.6% stake on a fully diluted basis, the announcement said. 
 As part of the deal, Gome’s entire product range – which includes domestic and international brands such as Siemens, Sony, Haier, Gree, and Midea – will be listed on Pinduoduo. Its logistics, delivery, and assembly services will be integrated with the ecommerce platform as well. 
 With the partnership, Pinduoduo’s users will be able to try and experience the products before placing orders, the statement said. 
 In addition to selling home appliances and digital devices, Gome provides other services such as equipment repairs and recycling. As of 2019, the company has over  2,600  offline retail stores across 776 cities in China. 
 Last year, Pinduoduo said it exceeded US$144.6 billion in gross merchandise value and saw a 40% increase in active buyers to 585.2 million, with annual spending per active buyer jumping 53%.

645165,How deep linking can enhance customer relationships during a crisis," The Covid-19 pandemic is  making the future look pretty grim . Businesses are struggling to keep their heads above water, and a  recession looks inevitable . 
 However, many companies are rising to the challenge by trying something new. Small businesses that have never had much of a digital presence are  moving online , and many conferences are  transitioning to digital formats . 
 Enterprises are also turning to mobile platforms such as apps to create a direct marketing channel to their customers, offering up personalized app experiences and services to drive engagement and build positive relationships. 
 Paying attention to consumers 
 Customer relationship management, or CRM, is  important for companies  because organizations can learn about their users’ preferences and optimize their processes to offer better experiences. 
 CRM often takes place through customer service encounters and marketing channels, among others. In some cases, these initiatives could determine whether consumers will stick to a company’s services or switch to a competitor’s instead. 
 And while maintaining these relationships can go a long towards  keeping customers loyal , it’s particularly crucial during a crisis, when  layoffs  and pay cuts become a painful reality. In such difficult times, people tend to reduce costs, which could lead them to stop using a service, limit purchases, or buy nothing at all. 
 As soon as the dust settles, though, businesses will want to woo back their customers, and one of the ways they can do this is to shift from a growth mindset to a retention mindset. 
 “This is the time to focus on customer relationships and retention, and less on growth,” says Mada Seghete, the head of strategy and market development and a co-founder of  Branch , a mobile measurement and deep-linking platform.

 The startup offers a platform for mobile measurement and deep linking, which enables companies to boost customer retention and create better user journeys. 
 The value of deep linking 
 So what exactly is deep linking? Simply put, it refers to a hyperlink that connects users to a specific piece of content on a platform. For example, if you receive an email from an ecommerce site and click on a promotion for shoes, deep linking ensures that you are directed to the page within the app that features the promotion, instead of just launching the app in general. 
 It sounds straightforward, but these small improvements make a huge difference. 
 One of Branch’s clients, for instance, saw the click-to-open rates for its app rise from 50% to 90% after using deep linking. Another client who implemented it across all its channels saw an improvement of over 20%. 
 Deep linking is also critical to ensuring a smooth online experience, as a disjointed user journey can put people off and drive them to take their business elsewhere 
 “There was an example circulating on Twitter about a customer who stopped his subscription to  The Wall Street Journal  because it kept asking him to log in,” shares Seghete. “It wasn’t able to recognize that it was the same user over multiple browsers, which was frustrating for him.” 
 More than its deep-linking feature, Branch also uses consumer data to help brands develop customized user experiences, such as offering discount codes if someone has had items in their cart for a while or optimizing the landing page for a particular user. 
 The company also helps convert mobile web users into app users. Mobile consumers make  twice as many purchases through apps  compared to the mobile web. As such, Branch helps businesses get more people on their apps by using custom content on the site or by prompting users to download the app when they click through on mobile web.

 As the Covid-19 pandemic spreads, personalized experiences help bolster customer loyalty. 
 “Build loyalty with your customers through interesting content, being helpful, sending them notes, telling them you understand that they’re going through a hard time, and giving them deals and discounts to help them get through this,” advises Seghete. 
 Companies may need to make some tough calls that affect short-term profits, but showing understanding and care to consumers during this period could really help in the long term, she adds. 
 The silver lining 
 While it appears that the Covid-19 will leave businesses in the lurch, they don’t have to take this sitting down. 
 Aside from adopting new approaches, companies are also  helping out where they can . They’re also improving their processes and  recalibrating their resources  preparing for when the pandemic has run its course. 
 Though there’s a lot of uncertainty now, Seghete believes that there’s light at the end of the tunnel. 
 “Focus on your customer relationships, on fixing your flows, and just be ready for when we are out of this,” she says. “After this is over, we will experience a period of unprecedented growth, and this is the time to invest in being ready for that.”

644951,"As Singapore sees more seniors, startups can step up"," Looking ahead into the new decade, it’s clear that sharing services and new digital products will continue to radically transform people’s lives – and that includes how seniors live in their retirement. 
 Singapore is turning silver as more people from the baby boomer generation (those born between 1946 and 1964) celebrate their 65th birthdays. And they’re not just living longer – they’re living longer as healthy and active members of their community, ushering in a booming silver economy. 
   
 Increasingly affluent and surprisingly tech-savvy, this growing group of senior citizens is creating a new market for tech startups and other businesses that are able to offer convenient, easy-to-use digital solutions. 
 The ‘Uberization’ of home care 
 Earlier this year, Singapore-based elderly care startup Homage announced the close of its series B funding round, which it plans to funnel into its expansion across Asia. The startup offers a digital platform that connects professional care providers with elderly people and their families in need of home-care support. 
 Launched in 2016, Homage now hosts a network of over 1,000 care professionals in Singapore and Malaysia and partners with more than 20 hospitals, community organizations, and nursing homes. It’s also raised over US$15 million of investment from the likes of Golden Gate Ventures, HealthXCapital, EV Growth, Alternate Ventures, and KDV Capital. 
 Other digital startups have cropped up offering similar platforms or apps. Caregiver Asia, for instance, operates an online marketplace to match people with freelance caregivers. Since its launch in 2015, the company has seen demand for its service grow, and today, it has a network of more than 10,000 caregivers across Singapore and Malaysia. 
 The opportunity 
 While these companies have revealed the possibilities of home-care services, there are other commercial opportunities that Singapore’s digital entrepreneurs can pick up on. One example is offering “active-aging” products and services that can help the silver community stay active, healthy, and independent. 
 In 2019, the spending power of baby boomers worldwide was estimated to be roughly US$15 trillion. More importantly, the aging market doesn’t only include those over 65 years old, but it also involves their children. 
 Around the world, digital entrepreneurs have begun to recognize the scale of the active-aging opportunity, and plenty of tech-based companies have sprung up, offering products and services aimed at the senior demographic. 
 Such innovations vary widely, from health monitoring devices, telemedicine services, wellness, nutrition, and fitness technologies to home automation systems, mobility devices, and others. 
 Singapore a sandbox for digital innovation 
 Singapore is already home to many businesses operating in the healthcare space. In fact, it is estimated that the city-state has around 9% of Asia’s healthtech startups – the largest number after China and India. 
 The government’s commitment to digital innovation and adoption, coupled with strong internet connectivity and high mobile and smartphone penetration, has given its entrepreneurs a significant leg-up and established Singapore as a “sandbox” for digital innovation within ASEAN. 
 Some of these companies are developing products that can be used by the elderly to improve wellness and prevent age-related diseases. For example, Biofourmis, a biotech company founded in Singapore, has developed an AI-based system that uses wearable devices to collect and analyze patients’ health data and predict the likelihood of medical events such as heart attacks. 
 The company has raised over US$40 million in equity financing from high-profile venture capital investors, including Sequoia Capital and MassMutual Ventures SEA. In 2019, it inked a partnership with a major multinational pharmaceutical company to further develop its products addressing heart disease. 
 Other examples include Holmusk, a Singaporean digital health and data science company that works in partnership with Caregiver Asia. It created GlycoLeap, a mobile app that provides dietary advice to help prevent and manage age- and lifestyle- related conditions like diabetes and heart disease. 
 Challenges remain 
 Despite these notable successes, only a small fraction of the 174 digital health startups registered in Singapore in 2018 was developing healthcare or active-aging products aimed at the elderly. 
 This may be due to several reasons: a perception that seniors are less comfortable using digital technologies, concerns over reputation, or an idea that entering the space will limit the total addressable market. 
 But companies can overcome these challenges. 
 First, digital entrepreneurs must devise a viable revenue model that maximizes its addressable market, while also knowing who will pay and how they will pay for the product or service. The revenue models can either be business-to-consumer or business-to-business. 
 Companies like Homage and Caregiver Asia provide their service directly to caregivers, the elderly, or their children, while others like Biofourmis or Holmusk partner with businesses or healthcare providers. 
 Second, organizations must carefully consider how to market and position themselves. 
 Many seniors may be reluctant to use platforms that are exclusively designed for the elderly or those that appear to use complex digital technology. To overcome these problems, companies can position their products as simple-to-use solutions or platforms to empower seniors. They can also direct marketing efforts at caregivers and the children of aging parents. 
 Creating a new pillar 
 In recent weeks, the Covid-19 outbreak has highlighted the world-class status of Singapore’s healthcare services and its ability to serve the senior population during an unprecedented public health crisis. 
 Yet as Singapore celebrates its 55th year of independence, those that were alive to see the nation born should look forward to a long and active retirement further enhanced and transformed by new digital innovations. 
 The city-state’s talented entrepreneurs, working in collaboration with the government, investors, and incumbent healthcare providers, should grasp the opportunities presented by this growing band of silver consumers, and, in so doing, build a new digital pillar.

645058,"[Updated] Dubious practices, ‘profiteering’ taint Indonesia’s bid to regulate online lending","  Update (April 24, 1:00 pm): Added comments from AFPI and OJK.  
  Update (May 5, 9:00 am): Added further comments from AFPI and OJK.  
 In Indonesia, more than a hundred online lending startups are vying for consumers who are underbanked and have little access to credit. But in the industry’s early days, government regulations had to play catch up. 
 Last year, incidents around  unethical collection methods  plagued the industry. In a high-profile case, a taxi driver  hanged himself  due to a “devil’s trap” of debt from illegal fintech firms. 
 Since then, regulatory oversight – including the process of getting a permanent online lending license – has become more stringent.

 But sources  Tech in Asia  spoke to suggest that there’s a lack of transparency over the licensing requirements and process. They talked about the “profiteering” behavior of vendors appointed by the online lending division of Otoritas Jasa Keuangan or OJK, Indonesia’s financial services authority. They also alleged conflicts of interest between OJK and Asosiasi FinTech Pendanaan Bersama Indonesia (AFPI), the industry association for online lenders. 
 These issues cast doubt on OJK’s effectiveness and ability to police the peer-to-peer lending sector, which is seeing more activity from both local and foreign players, especially China-backed companies. The Covid-19 pandemic will likely bring added  pressures , with more people defaulting on their loans. 
 However, when  Tech in Asia  reached out to OJK for comment, it contended that everything it does “puts forward procedural and governance aspects,” according to a spokesperson. “If there is input from the public, it can be submitted to OJK’s whistleblowing system. We will seriously follow up on accurate data and information.” 
 Inefficient, “profiteering” vendors 
 Getting registered is the first step to securing a license from OJK. The regulator closes down unregistered companies – OJK claims that  2,406 of these firms  have been shuttered between 2018 and March 2020. 
 According to OJK regulations, a registered company has one year to gain a full license. In the meantime, it can largely operate the same way as fully licensed companies. 
 But here’s the rub: only 25 companies have managed to obtain that license since the first one was granted in mid-2017. 
 Another 136 are still registered, with 59 of them for more than one year. A company will lose its registration status after that time, according to OJK rules. 
 AFPI clarifies that as long as a company has submitted the application within the one-year deadline and has not been rejected, it can continue operating. 
 The association is currently enforcing a moratorium for new registrations, with the next batch of approvals slated to be open in the second half of the year. AFPI’s current infrastructure can’t keep up with demand and accommodate all licensed and registered players, says Adrian Gunadi, CEO of  Investree  and chairman of AFPI. 
 In conversations with  Tech in Asia , founders of registered online lenders pointed out that requirements are difficult to heed. Also, several of them said that unnecessary fees are paid out to OJK-appointed vendors, with one person describing their actions as “profiteering” behavior. 
 
  Image of a document outlining a solution for a company alleged to have violated regulations. 
 
 For instance, there was one company that was found to have violated regulations. This would have jeopardized its registration status and chances for a full license. 
 But a law firm claiming to have inside access to OJK proposed a solution where the company’s C-suite executives would step down and be replaced, according to a document reviewed by  Tech in Asia  (OJK says it does not appoint any law firms to assist platforms with the licensing process). The preferred CEO candidate should be an existing chief executive of another fintech company who’s familiar with OJK’s online lending directorate. 
 The law firm would then be in charge of the headhunting service for both the board of directors and the board of commissioners. The fee for the proposed solution amounted to tens of thousands of US dollars. 
 
  Continuation of above document, outlining the fees involved. 
 
 Here’s another example: Every online lending app is required to ask each new borrower to submit a digital signature for future use. 
 According to OJK regulations, creating the digital signature can only be done through a vendor officially appointed by the Ministry of Communications and Information. There are  four companies  that can do so, including the MDI Ventures-backed startup PrivyID. 
 The source, who was from a company backed by Singaporean investors, didn’t identify the vendor they worked with but characterized its implementation process as “inefficient and very dumb.” 
 For instance, multiple one-time PINs (OTPs) are required for user verification. An OTP is already part of a company’s user application process, but the digital signature vendor requires a separate OTP to be done through its own channels, the source says. 
 This means that companies would need to pay for the additional OTP text message, on top of other fees for the digital signature sign-up process and implementation. 
 Companies are also unable to share the digital signature of the same user, even if they use the same vendor. This means that each company has to pay for the entire digital signature process whenever a new borrower applies for a loan – even though that digital signature already exists in the system. 
 The source adds that while they are unable to recall the exact cost per unit for digital signatures, it was “very expensive.” They have raised the issue repeatedly with both OJK and the vendors, but no action has been taken. 
 “It doesn’t follow what I would call global standards or industry practices on digital signatures,” the source observes. “It’s profiteering, in my opinion.” 
 Another example is debt collection. According to regulation, online lenders are not allowed to send their own employees to collect outstanding loans after 90 days. Instead, they have to hire – and therefore pay – one of six collection agencies certified by AFPI. 
 The rationale for this appears to be a desire to avoid unethical collection practices that plagued the industry last year. However, sources challenge whether this is necessary when their in-house collectors already undergo OJK-sanctioned training. 
 The training isn’t free, says one source. OJK and AFPI routinely hold seminars and workshops on topics such as training and certification for customer service or for debt collection. Companies are required to join these events, and they have to pay a fee. 
 OJK and AFPI also hold roadshows around the country. Attendance to these events isn’t compulsory, says one source, but even if a company doesn’t attend, they are still expected to pay a participation fee. 
 The fees for these sessions don’t appear to be high, but the source says that there’s no transparency over what the fees are for. 
 AFPI says that the pricing for digital signatures are determined by commercial agreements between companies and providers, putting it outside the jurisdiction of AFPI or OJK. An OTP is not the only authentication method available, depending on the digital signature providers. 
 The workshops and roadshows, on the other hand, are geared towards educating new players or improving financial literacy among potential borrowers. 
 “There are fintech lenders from China whose business practices may not be aligned with what we have agreed and standardized here,” explains Gunadi. “These events set the tone for whoever is entering the industry.” 
 The fees involved are used to cover training costs. For roadshows, a typical price for a booth starts from 3 million rupiah (US$192), which AFPI says is cheaper compared to what companies that organize such events charge. 
 Conflicts of interest 
 Cultivating relationships is also an important part of the licensing process, the sources note, which is par for course when doing business in Indonesia. For online lenders, that starts with being a member of AFPI. Like most industry associations, AFPI’s executive committee primarily consists of CEOs and other representatives from licensed companies. For instance, the CEOs from six of the first seven companies to get the license are all on the committee. 
 But AFPI is different in that it was appointed by OJK. Its main role is to help the regulator monitor companies, especially by setting out a code of conduct dealing with matters not addressed by OJK rules. 
 This raises questions around conflicts of interest, says one source, as the boundary between OJK and AFPI is blurred. It seems as if the fate of many online lending players in Indonesia is determined by their competitors, who were able to enter the industry and acquire that elusive license earlier. 
 AFPI says that this is common practice in other parts of the finance industry, such as banking and multifinance, where an industry association sets out market conduct while enforcing market discipline. 
 The standing of AFPI’s code of conduct is on par with OJK regulations. If a company commits a violation, the consequences can go as far as having its AFPI membership revoked – this is the same as losing its registered status with OJK. 
 AFPI says that the code of conduct references other countries’ fintech lending associations, including that of the US. The code of conduct was prepared by a task force consisting of over 20 AFPI members. All members are welcome to join this task force, adds AFPI. 
 Sources claim, however, that the code of conduct is enforced unevenly. 
 One person who worked at a company that violated a rule says that when they arrived at the initial meeting with OJK representatives to discuss the violation, it was as if the punishment had already been decided. 
 “There was no due process,” points out the source. 
 Aside from formal punishment, companies that breach regulations also get publicly scolded in front of other industry players during meetings or gatherings, which one source deems “unprofessional.” 
 Sources  Tech in Asia  spoke to have witnessed such incidents and have been on the receiving end of such humiliating rebuke. They say that the person who routinely does the reprimanding is Hendrikus Passagi, director of OJK’s online lending division. 
 In the event of a violation, AFPI’s first step is to act as a mediator between the company and the affected customer. But if the parties are unable to reach an agreement or if the violations are repetitive, then the case will go into AFPI’s legal and ethics committee. 
 According to Akseleran CEO Ivan Tambunan, who serves as vice chair of the legal and ethics committee, the group is made up of lawyers who are not involved with any fintech lending platform. 
 China as a cautionary tale 
 For now, registered online lending companies in Indonesia can operate the same way as licensed ones. But it still means operating in limbo since technically, regulations can be enforced at a moment’s notice. 
 A license also removes regulatory risk, which in turn can help bring in investors, as at least one company  has found . With firms aiming to supercharge their market shares, funding can make an important difference. 
 Ultimately, the fees and the grey area surrounding regulations make running a sustainable business difficult, says a source.

 A more macro implication is the rate of nonperforming loans (NPLs) or defaults, which is an important barometer for the industry’s health – the lower the number, the better it is. Indonesia’s official NPL ratio as of February 2020 is  about 4% , but that’s too low for a developing market, says one source. 
 Another person says that the 90-day default rate is low because there was never strong governance on what companies did with bad debt. This is because the regulations on how to calculate that number are “loose” enough to be open for interpretation, making it “easily massageable.” 
 The source adds it’s possible that bad debt is transferred to other companies, either locally or abroad. 
 According to one source, the real NPL was 7% to over 20% depending on the loan’s vintage, with the poorer performing players at over 30%. Another source claims it could even reach 40%. 
 One source hopes that the Indonesian scene does not go the way of China, where online lending went through a boom before undergoing a  painful course correction  as regulators stepped in to limit risky financial practices. 
 The Chinese government’s clampdown meant many fintech founders ended up in prison for running what essentially were  Ponzi schemes . Others set sail for  neighboring – and less mature – markets  like India, Vietnam, and of course, Indonesia.

 Indeed, some of Indonesia’s online lending companies are said to have links with businesses from China, either directly or through having a Chinese national as a founder. To be sure, foreign ownership is allowed per OJK regulations. 
 Case in point: fintech companies RupiahPlus and Akulaku were both established by Chinese nationals. RupiahPlus had been registered with OJK while it was operating (it has since pivoted to credit scoring under the  Pyxis  brand), while Akulaku is still registered through its peer-to-peer brand Asetku. 
 Both also happened to be among the five online lenders that received the most customer complaints, according to a  2019 report  by consumer watchdog Indonesian Consumers Foundation. 
 But an even bigger issue may be illustrated by another China-linked online lender, which was not OJK-registered (and therefore illegal) but was still able to operate anyway. Called TokoTunai, authorities got wind of the company in December 2019, when the police  raided and closed  its office as well as arrested its founders. 
 But by then, TokoTunai had already disbursed  70 billion rupiah  (US$4.4 million) in loans to 85,000 people.

644902,Trends and pivots in the coronavirus economy," With Covid-19 dragging the economy down and people cooped up at home or sheltering in place, consumer behaviors and trends are changing. 
 Businesses have to find a way to pivot to meet these new demands and habits. The obvious ones are easy to spot like food delivery, entertainment (Netflix!), and productivity software that make working from home possible. 
 I’ve consolidated the rest in the list below. We hope this helps you stay more in tune with our changing world. 
 Online legal advice ⚖️ 
 
 Lockdowns are forcing couples to spend an increasing amount of time together. Throw in money problems amid a slowing economy, and the chances for arguments increase. It’s happening  in China  and  in the U.S , which may cause a surge in demand for online lawyers. 
 The pandemic has also  pushed  wealthy elderly folks to seek advice on how to write their will. Thankfully, that can be  done online , too. 
 
 Gaming from home 🎮 
 
 Sales of video games  are soaring  as people find ways to entertain themselves.  Gaming companies  like Tencent, Sony, Microsoft, and Apple are the winners. 
 Online game retailers are also  enjoying the surge . 
 Similarly, companies that sell gaming gear and consoles are experiencing high demand. That includes  Nintendo Switch ,  Xbox , and  Razer products . 
 
 Cooking at home 👩‍🍳 
 
 US-based Waffle House couldn’t offer its signature menu item in its restaurants. So the company made its waffle mix available online and it was  sold out in four hours . 
 Shake Shack is offering  DIY kits  so you can enjoy its burgers from home. 
 
 Demand for flour  is on the rise as people are looking to bake to kill boredom and at the same time fill their stomachs. 
 Baking and cooking are also healthy activities to do  with kids  and can also  distract people  away from their anxieties. 
 As a result, sales for cooking appliances are  skyrocketing . 
 
 Mental wellness and recreation 🧘 
 
 The current situation is  uncertain , and it’s detrimental to our mental health. CNN reported that a crisis hotline has seen an  891% spike in calls . 
 Meditation apps like Calm and Headspace are seeing a  spike in downloads  in the corona economy. 
 
 Alcohol  and  legal cannabis  sales are higher as well. 
 Alcohol delivery app Drizly  told Yahoo  that it saw “sales explode in the last week of March, climbing 537% above the company’s expectations.” 
 
 Keeping kids entertained 🤡 
 
 Parents have to work from home… with their kids around. To stay focused, they have to keep their kids entertained. Providing toys is one of the solutions, and Hasbro is seeing a  surge in sales . 
 Parents are also under pressure to act as teachers, scrambling to set up home-school schedules during the lockdown. 
 
 “With schools across the country closed and unlikely to reopen soon, families are gathering teaching materials, setting up schedules, and looking for ways to keep kids engaged beyond the limited hours of remote-learning school days,”  writes learning specialist  Katharine Hill in  The New York Times . 
 There are several useful and free resources in that NYT piece to help you plan your kids’ schedule. 
 Online learning 🤓 
 “In highly competitive markets like India and Southeast Asia, parents are even more keen for their children to perform well in exams and find better employment opportunities,” says GV Ravishankar, a managing director at Sequoia Capital India. 
 
 Online education companies are  defying the funding slowdown . They continue to do well in the Covid-19 economy as kids stay home and education has to go on. 
 To suit current user behavior, Airbnb has  launched “online experiences” , bringing their offline experience online. 
 Events have gone virtual as well, from open-house school tours  via Minecraft  to trade conferences like our very own  Product Development Conference . 
 Some students got creative and still marched towards “ graduation .” 
 
 Work-from-home fashion 👕 
 According to  a report  jointly produced by The Business of Fashion and McKinsey &amp; Company: 
 
 The personal luxury goods industry (luxury fashion, accessories, and watches as well as fine jewelry and high-end beauty), estimates a global revenue contraction of 35% to 39% in 2020 year-on-year. 
 If stores remain closed for two months, McKinsey analysis approximates that 80% of publicly listed fashion companies in Europe and North America will be in financial distress. 
 A large number of global fashion companies are expected to go bankrupt in the next 12 to 18 months. 
 
 The pain trickles down to the workforce. As demand drops, garment workers are also  feeling the pinch . “If our workers don’t die from coronavirus, they’d die of starvation,” an industry executive pointed out. 
 Meanwhile, comfort wear and pajamas are  in vogue  as people stay indoors. 
 Other trends 🔥 
 
 As the risk of catching the novel coronavirus shoots up, even grocery workers are  reluctant to turn up at work . If Covid-19 cases escalate in your city, the same problem may apply to services that still require workers to go out, including food and ecommerce deliveries. 
 Six things that are undergoing  a sales boom : Exercise gear, gardening items, electronics, coffee, games, and books. 
 Condom sales are  up in India . People are also  watching more pornography  and purchasing  more sex toys . 
 Coronavirus fears are driving up  interest in private jets . 
 Random but interesting: Rats are going hungry and they’re  eating their own kind . 
 
 Interesting pivots ✨ 
 
 A strip club gets their strippers to  deliver food … while topless. 
 An apparel brand now makes and  sells masks . 
 A cinema has turned its parking lots into a  drive-in cinema . 
 
 Similarly, Razer has also “pivoted” some of its manufacturing lines to  produce surgical masks  for Southeast Asia. That’s quite a feat, and I have a lot of respect for that. In fact, it spurred me to reach out to discuss their work further. 
 The company agreed, so now we have a virtual event:  How Razer joined the X-Force . 
 Join us on April 22 and listen to Edwin Chan, Razer’s chief investment officer, and LiMeng Lee, who serves as chief strategy officer. We will talk about the company’s actions during Covid-19, its leadership during a time of crisis, and more. 
 Stay optimistic! 💪

645110,5 takeaways from our virtual panel on how startups can survive 2020," “How can my startup survive 2020?” That is a question many founders are asking today, as even companies who believe they would not be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic will be—one way or another. 
 Tech in Asia was fortunate to hear from Amit Saberwal, the CEO of hospitality startup Reddoorz, and Dimitra Taslim, an investor at GGV Capital, as they share their insights and opinions on what it will take for startups to pull themselves up by their bootstraps amid the Covid-19 crisis. 
 Here are the five important points that we gleaned from them as part of our first virtual panel discussion  “How Can Startups Survive 2020”  which was livestreamed on April 8. 
    
 1. Keeping a steady runway 
 One thing that both Saberwal and Taslim agreed on right off the bat was the need for sufficient capital to last a company, at the very least through Q1 2022. This would put them in a much better position to navigate a dynamically changing situation and lets them take advantage of the opportunity for recovery and upturn the soonest it happens. According to Saberwal, being financially prepared can help make up for lost ground faster once the crisis is over. 
 While some startups have been fortunate to close fresh funding recently, Taslim advised those who have not to consider alternative sources of funding, such as bank loans or venture debt. The bar for securing new rounds has been raised, as investors will be mostly looking at startups who show signs of profitability. From Taslim’s perspective, companies that are asset-heavy may look a little less attractive now. 
 Increased importance has also been placed on positive contribution margins, where a company doesn’t lose money in each transaction and can earn back every dollar it spends on marketing. Placing all its cards on the table and considering mergers could also be another option, depending on the company’s situation and industry, opined Saberwal. 
  “Competitors in the past could very well be partners in the future” – Amit Saberwal.  
 2. Exercising financial discipline and prudence 
 If gaining extra capital proves to be a stumbling block, the next option is to look within the company and reduce all nonessential costs. 
 Reddoorz, for instance, is operating on a “zero-revenue budget” assumption until the middle of next year, Saberwal shared. Redeploying capital to core products and markets was also one strategy the company has employed to ensure that it is ready when an eventual recovery does occur. 
 Having less growth also presents an opportune time for companies to revisit their technical stack and pay off technical debt by optimizing their processes. These would inadvertently save costs. 
 However, some expenses are interlinked with each other, and, as Taslim put it, present themselves as a “trail of breadcrumbs.” If demand is low for your product, it would not make sense to keep a huge team of salespeople. Similarly, without any new accounts being brought in, the number of customer success managers for such accounts would be redundant. 
 By following the breadcrumbs throughout the company, cost savings can be easily identified. However, both Saberwal and Taslim were quick to advise founders that layoffs should be seen only as the last resort and must be conducted in the most humane way possible. 
 3. Managing the inevitable layoffs and salary cuts 
 What if nonessential costs include jobs and salary revisions? That’s probably one of the hardest but  necessary decisions  a founder has to make, Saberwal shared. He suggested keeping employees on reduced wages during a leave of absence if their roles are made redundant during this period. 
 “It is better for the whole company to suffer together than to keep a remaining few,” Taslim said, as company morale would be badly hit by mass layoffs. A suggestion he gave for CEOs is to form a taskforce with their chief financial officer, head of people, and legal counsel when deciding what roles should be restructured, who will be affected, and how will they be compensated. The investor also believes that there is no magic percentage when it comes to deciding how much of a pay cut the company should put in effect. 
 4. Making marketing relevant again 
 Marketing is the likeliest function to receive budget cuts, but that does not mean it should cease to exist. For example, Reddoorz is focusing its marketing efforts on channels that do not call for too much cost, such as SEO, shared Saberwal. It’s also putting more effort on reactivating previous customers and managing customer churn. 
 Taslim agreed that this is crucial, as customer acquisition is difficult at this point. It would be better to continually engage past customers so that they will stick around during the recovery period. Marketing tone will also need to be more sensitive: Companies can highlight initiatives that have an added element of corporate social responsibility to them. 
 5. Digging deep and sticking through 
 We’ve heard of unicorns and zebras before, but both panelists agreed that now is the time for  cockroaches —startups that place less emphasis on growth and more on survival—to emerge from the shadows of Covid-19. 
 After all, it was shortly after the SARS pandemic of 2003 that Alibaba launched its hugely successful ecommerce site Taobao and its cloud service Alibaba Cloud, said Taslim. Saberwal added that by focusing the entire organization’s efforts on a clear direction and strategy, collective wisdom and effort can be harnessed better. 
 While there’s no crystal ball that can predict what the future holds for startups, it’s worthwhile to have some idea on how the landscape will change post-Covid-19. 
 Taslim believes big tech companies will emerge even stronger from the current situation because of three things: (1) their business models that are centered around network effects; (2) the almost negligible cost of goods sold; and (3) a nonlinear cost of user acquisition. These make them well-equipped to weather out the storm.  Startups must keep these giant competitors in their purview when strategizing for the next 12 to 18 months. 
 Saberwal, on the other hand, thinks it is still a good time to be a startup, as the ecosystem in the region has evolved and matured a lot and is able to better support companies through this period. 
 Startup founders are known to be survivors and would likely get past this downturn together. We hope that from this sharing, you are invigorated to proclaim, “My startup can survive 2020!” and continue doing the good work that has helped the Southeast Asian startup ecosystem develop greatly in the last few years.

644845,A visual timeline of TikTok’s rise,"   
 ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
 With its parent firm Bytedance owning  23%  of the Chinese digital app market, TikTok has what it takes to become a superstar platform. In China, where TikTok is known as Douyin, Bytedance reports that the app is popular among  68%  of Chinese social media users and  59%  of smartphone users. 
 Outside of gaming apps, TikTok is the third-most downloaded app globally, behind WhatsApp and Messenger. It has  2 billion all-time downloads  across AppStore &amp; Google Play and was downloaded  738 million times  in 2019. 
   
   
   
   
   
 WHY IT MATTERS 
 It’s the first time in history that a Chinese social media product is gaining global traction. 
 The key to TikTok’s success lies in its ability to quickly tap into both the Chinese market and a global audience before Facebook can go aggressive with another “ Project Voldemort .” 
 Bytedance’s acquisition of Musical.ly was the first big step towards TikTok’s domination of the US market. The app hit 2 billion for lifetime installs in 2020, which can be attributed to coronavirus-triggered lockdowns across the world. 
 However, despite its massive user growth, TikTok is still making baby steps in terms of revenue. In 2019, the platform generated US$176.9 million in revenue, excluding non-iOS Chinese revenue. As such, the pressure is now on Bytedance, as Facebook and Instagram have stepped forward with Lasso and Reels. 
 How TikTok plans to win against the US social media goliath is certainly worth watching.

645072,These Chinese startups attracted sizable funding amid Covid-19 pandemic," Since China was first rocked by the Covid-19 outbreak around Lunar New Year in January this year, many facets of the everyday economy experienced major disruptions. However, venture capital and fundraising in China’s dynamic startup ecosystem remained resilient, continuing to advance their strategies amidst an uncertain macroeconomic environment. 
 Looking back at the fundraising deals that happened during the outbreak period, we can see continued investment in robotics, education technology, supply chain logistics, and frontier technologies.

  Robotics  
 The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated demand for autonomous solutions, and investment in the Chinese robotics sector continued throughout the outbreak period. Specifically, deals were closed in robotics, including hardware, like robot cleaners and waiters, and software such as computer vision, audio recognition, and chatbot tech. 
 On the software side, Zhejiang-based AISpeech, specializing in voice interaction solutions, just closed a 410 million yuan (US$58 million) series E round led by CTC Capital. The firm counts Alibaba, Foxconn, and MediaTek as other investors. It has over 8,000 clients including Alibaba, Xiaomi, and SF. 
 Meanwhile, chatbot solutions provider Xiaoneng closed a series C round worth 125 million yuan (US$17.6 million). According to financial data provider Jingdata, China’s chatbot industry is worth 15 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion). 
 In terms of hardware, Bytedance co-led a 100 million yuan (US$14.1 million) series B round for Narwal Robotics, a maker of autonomous cleaning robots. 
 Keenon Robotics, a Shanghai-based manufacturer of robot waiters, closed a series B round on March 10 at 200 million yuan (US$28.8 million). The company dominates the service robot industry and is popular in the hospitality sector and among restaurants, like hot pot brand Haidilao. Its goal this year is to provide 10,000 new robots to significantly strengthen its position in the space. 
 Focused more on enterprise solutions, Chinese autonomous mobile robot (AMR) company ForwardX Robotics completed a 100 million yuan (US$14.1 million) series B+ financing round on April 2. Headquartered in Beijing, the firm uses computer vision and AI to augment processes in the logistics and manufacturing industries. 
 Also, Shanghai-based Encoo, founded in 2017, hauled in 211.6 million yuan (US$30 million) in series B funding in a round led by Sequoia Capital China on March 16. Encoo specializes in robotic process automation (RPA), which automates a wide range of business processes to optimize efficiency. 
  Education and healthcare technology  
 The Covid-19 pandemic has required educational institutions to quickly pivot to online instruction, as China’s online education market has experienced continuous growth in the past five years. It’s also expected to hit 453.8 billion yuan (US$65.4 billion) in 2020, according to industry research firm iiMedia. 
 Yuanfudao stole the headlines at the end of March, setting the record for the largest fundraising deal in edtech as it raised 7 billion yuan (US$1 billion) in a series G round. The Beijing-based edtech giant operates six apps within its ecosystem and boasts 400 million users, of which 1.5 million are paid subscribers.

 Meanwhile, coding education company Xiaomawang raised 150 million yuan (US$21.2 million) in a pre-series C round to expand its course offerings and improve technologies. 
 Health care is another physical industry forced to develop online solutions due to the public health crisis. On March 20, Yizhun Intelligent, a firm using AI to improve medical imaging and diagnostics, closed a 100 million yuan (US$14 million) series B round to continue product development and commercial expansion. Specifically, Yizhun’s technology has developed intelligent detection systems for serious ailments including lung diseases and breast cancer. 
 Another startup in the healthcare sector to secure funding during the outbreak period was Nuanwa Technology, a Shanghai-based firm helping health insurance companies digitize their offerings and sales channels. Nuanwa, incubated by Chinese insurance giant Zhongan Insurance since October 18, served more than 10 insurance companies during the fourth quarter of 2019. 
  Supply chain and logistics  
 As the Covid-19 pandemic puts stress on global supply chains, investment in Chinese companies eager to modernize logistics networks in areas including agriculture, future foods, and mapping tech has increased. 
 In March, Tencent became the second-largest shareholder of Xinteng Shuzhi Network Technology, a firm active in numerous businesses, including animal feed, pig breeding, dairy, meat processing, and distribution. 
 Meanwhile, Shenzhen-based artificial meat startup Starfield closed an undisclosed financing round from US-based New Crop Capital, an early investor in protein-substitute company Beyond Meat. 
 Rounding out a busy March for investment in the food space, Meituan led a series B round for agricultural product distributor Wangjiahuan, which counts over 20,000 corporate and institutional clients ranging from schools and hospitals to restaurants and supermarkets. 
 Along the ecommerce supply chain, SF Express’ map service subsidiary SFMap closed a series A round on March 27 worth 100 million yuan (US$14 million). SFMap specializes in high-definition mapping powered by AI technology to enhance smart supply chain management and delivery logistics. 
 Additionally, business-to-customer export ecommerce company Orderplus raised a 100 million yuan (US$14 million) series B investment round to expand into new markets. The firm partners with Chinese manufacturers and sells products abroad under many different brands, with main target markets including the US and Europe. 
  Frontier tech  
 During the outbreak period, Chinese companies working on frontier technologies including autonomous driving, enterprise AI, and space exploration managed to close sizeable investments. 
 First, Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank is said to be nearing another US$300 million investment in Didi Chuxing’s autonomous driving subsidiary, while Toyota led a financing round for Guangzhou-based Pony.ai to the tune of US$400 million. Pony.ai, one of the leading autonomous driving startups in China despite being founded in just December 2016, now boasts a valuation of over US$3 billion. 
 On the other hand, AI startup Laiye raised 296 million yuan (US$42 million) in a series C round closed in late February. The company uses AI to develop intelligent robots and other assistant products which have been adopted by various companies including travel platform Ctrip and on-demand service provider Meituan. 
 A maverick of China’s up and coming private aerospace sector, Beijing-based MinoSpace raised 100 million yuan (US$14 million) in a series A round in early March. More than 141 commercial aerospace companies have been registered in China by the end of 2018, crowding the sector. However, MinoSpace already launched four satellites into orbit in 2019 and will use the newly raised capital to finance the development of larger satellites. 
 The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitization of many traditionally offline businesses, while increased demand for robotic solutions, autonomous driving, and advanced supply chain technology indicates a shift towards an economy that delivers efficiency without the requirement of human-to-human contact. In addition, for industries like health care and education, the popularization of online solutions democratizes accessibility in these vital sectors, which have been primarily concentrated in China’s urban centers. 
 Due to the size of the Chinese market, scaling these digital platforms and services can be capital-intensive for companies, while venture capital activity in these sectors remains crucial to the health of the startup ecosystem.

645008,"Funding Societies raises $40m, but streamlines its business amid Covid-19"," Funding Societies, a peer-to-peer lending platform targeting small and medium-sized enterprises, has shed 18% of its total workforce across its Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia offices,  Tech in Asia  has learned. It brings the total staff tally at the startup to more than 300 employees. 
 The layoffs, which took place at the end of March, were triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic and comes at a time when investor scrutiny on unprofitable startups has peaked. While the revenues of the Sequoia-backed firm haven’t yet been hit, it’s expecting further challenges ahead. The company is also looking to shore up its tech talent amid criticisms by former and current employees that the firm’s tech processes are problematic.

 “It was a cost-cutting [measure] as a result of the uncertainty from Covid-19. At the same time, we took the opportunity to streamline the business,” co-founder and group CEO Kelvin Teo tells  Tech in Asia . The company has also made changes to its operational plans, including shutting down products that weren’t profitable. 
 Corporate bankruptcies are set to rise in Singapore this year as the country heads toward its  worst contraction in two decades . Analysts are forecasting that nonperforming loan ratios for the city-state’s two largest banks – DBS Bank and the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation – will increase to 1.8% this year from 1.5% in 2019, driven by the outbreak, according to  Bloomberg . 
 As people and companies fall on hard times, microlending platforms such as Funding Societies are likely to be hit by a wave of loan defaults. However, no further layoffs are expected at the startup, Teo says. The firm had begun making the necessary adjustments in early February when Singapore raised its risk assessment of the pandemic to  Dorscon Orange  – the country’s second-highest alert level for diseases.   
 “We tried to do [the layoffs] early and ahead of the market,” Teo says, hoping that prompt action would give affected employees the best chance of finding a new job.

 As things stand, the startup’s nonperforming loan rates – the measure of loans that have defaulted or are close to defaulting – have been steadily rising since 2017 and stood at 2.27% in 2019, public figures on its site show. 
 Teo declined to disclose the startup’s internal forecasts for 2020 but said that the firm is taking a “more careful approach” on credit. In Singapore and Malaysia, for instance, Funding Societies has reduced loan disbursement volume significantly. 
 An employee who was laid off in the startup’s Kuala Lumpur office tells  Tech in Asia  that the staff cuts have touched mainly junior members, but Teo says the exercise applied to employees across the board. 
 A quiet fundraise 
 Founded in 2015, Funding Societies is headquartered in Singapore and operates under the Modalku brand in Indonesia. The archipelago is the startup’s largest market, accounting for more than 40% of its total loan volume. 
 In the last few years, the fintech company has grown fast. Last November, it  hit a S$1 billion (US$707 million) milestone  in total loans disbursed, which has risen to S$1.3 billion (US$939 million) as of April.

 Such rapid growth has come at the expense of falling investment returns, however. The weighted average return rate, excluding nonperforming loans, was 9.8% in 2019, down from 16.2% in 2017, which the CEO attributes to economic headwinds. “Singapore went through a near-recession in 2019,” Teo justifies. 
 In February, Funding Societies had quietly raised a series C round, with US$40 million committed in equity. Its backers were a mix of new and existing investors as well as one bank, which the CEO declined to name. 
 “In hindsight, maybe we should have announced [the fundraise] early to avoid unnecessary anxiety,” Teo says candidly. 
 While the funds were initially intended to be invested in new initiatives, those plans have now been scaled down. The startup has also become a lot more selective of which new business areas it will put money behind.

 In Indonesia, it has shut down a digital microfinancing product which was unprofitable, after experimenting with it for a year. “We realized that with Covid-19 on the horizon and with quite a bit of work we have to do to bring [the platform] to profitability, it wasn’t something that we could invest resources on,” Teo says. 
 However, the CEO clarifies that the company is prepared for a protracted market downturn, adding that it has successfully secured credit lines from financial institutions as well. 
 Pandemic hits regional players 
 The Singapore-headquartered startup isn’t alone in its drive to optimize costs and manage risks during this crisis. Leading consumer lending platforms in Indonesia such as Akulaku, Kredivo, and UangTeman have similarly tightened their selection criteria for new clients seeking loans. 
 Akulaku, another Sequoia-backed company,  laid off hundreds of employees  at the start of April, affected staff told  Tech in Asia  this week. 
 At UangTeman, all employees have been asked to volunteer partial salary deferments or unpaid leave applications on a voluntary basis in place of compulsory cuts, chief executive Aidil Zulkifli announced in  a LinkedIn post . 
 Teo, however, says Funding Societies’ Indonesian operations have seen a smaller impact than its Singapore and Malaysia businesses. 
 So far, the startup’s direct exposure to sectors that have been hit the hardest by the pandemic appears to be limited. As of April 2020, hospitality and F&amp;B sectors collectively make up 16.4% of its total number of approved loans. 
   
 This is reflected in the minimal impact on overall default rates so far – which have increased from 1.05% from the fourth quarter of 2019 to 1.3% in the first quarter this year – but that might worsen with Singapore implementing enhanced social distancing measures and Malaysia in lockdown, Teo cautions. 
 With slower economic activity in the coming months, there will no doubt be an increase in repayment deferment requests from SMEs, Wong Kah Meng, the CEO of Funding Societies Malaysia, said in  a report this month . 
 As of March 2020, approximately 10% of SME clients had requested for rescheduling of their repayments, he added. 
 ‘All fin and no tech’ 
 Despite the downsizing, the firm will continue to beef up hiring in areas including cybersecurity as well as senior roles in engineering and enterprise risk management. 
 “The genesis of the exercise was to drive toward profitability,” says Teo. “To that extent, we are still hiring but selectively in key areas which will set the company up for success. Some unicorns are laying off tech folks in Indonesia, and we’re hoping to shift some of our hiring over there.” 
 The startup’s plan to invest in tech staff could be a response to the persistent claims of employees that the company is “all fin and no tech.” 
 In January, a former employee wrote on the online jobs portal Glassdoor about how technology costs in the company were skyrocketing. “Mistakes that occur as a result of technology occur on a regular basis. [A] simple issue like keeping a record of the correct account balance for an investor is a challenge for this company,” the anonymous employee wrote. The review has since been removed. 
 Another employee who was affected by the recent layoffs confirms this. 
 In theory, having sound technological processes goes hand in hand with better products. Without such processes, initiatives downstream – such as creating better risk models – work less effectively. 
 A problematic company culture at Funding Societies, where employees were focused on developing “the next big thing” rather than maintaining tech products, had led to a deterioration of its tech processes, says an ex-staff member who spoke to  Tech in Asia  on the condition of anonymity. “So what happens is existing products and features become broken and unusable,” the employee notes. 
 In response to these claims, Teo says that it’s a common problem when a company has only one tech team serving operations in different areas. “Each country gets some of the automation but not all that they want,” he says. 
 With a presence in three countries, it’s also difficult for Funding Societies to automate its SME financing service because of “local nuances,” the CEO adds. 
 Some employees have even taken aim at the firm’s  “poor quality of management”  and  “inexperienced leadership team” , Glassdoor reviews left by disgruntled ex-employees show. 
 Last year, the startup went through “a round of leadership build up,” a process Teo acknowledges he could have managed better. “We did make some poor calls in the process. Some of the senior industry hires turned out to be not fitting of our culture and that did cause a bit of frustration within the team and organization,” he admits. 
 Overall, however, the CEO remains “cautiously optimistic” about the current economic uncertainty. “We’re hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, and that’s why we took action so quickly, even to the extent of being seen as alarmist,” he says.

645021,Facebook reportedly in talks with Indian conglomerate Reliance to create super app," Facebook and Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) are looking to create a WeChat-like super app that combines social, digital payments, gaming, and flight and hotel bookings, among other features, the  Economic Times  reported, citing four people familiar with the matter. 
 RIL owns large businesses in sectors such as retail (Reliance Retail), telecommunications (Jio), and digital services.

 According to the report, the idea was to create a platform that enables not only communication but also grocery shopping through RIL’s retail platforms and payments via JioMoney, the conglomerate’s fintech app. The new super app would leverage WhatsApp’s platform and user base, the sources said. 
 The project would also see Facebook and RIL contributing funding, technical skill, and domain knowhow to the app’s development. 
 RIL has yet to respond to questions, while Facebook refused to comment, the report said. 
 The final structure of the project, which is still in the process of due diligence, is yet to be settled. “A new company could be created – where both the players could invest – or Facebook could invest in Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail, and that is the way the partnership could be formed for the new venture,” one of the sources was quoted as saying in the report. 
 The ongoing discussions, however, have been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Earlier this year, it was reported that Facebook was in talks to  acquire a 10% stake  in RIL’s Jio, which has become a leading telco in India. 
 “There is going to be a collaboration, but it’s not clear how the companies will come together since a lot would depend on commercial viability and the technical knowhow both the players would bring in,” said one of the sources.

 Quest Ventures said it plans to look for post-seed and series A opportunities across Southeast Asia and emerging Asia for its Asia Fund II. Already present in Vietnam, the company also plans to expand its footprint to other countries in the region, including Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines. 
 Although it’s called Asia Fund II, the vehicle is Quest Ventures’ first institutionally backed fund. Its prior fund was invested out of the personal capital of its managing partner James Tan, according to a statement. Some of its notable investments include Carousell, ShopBack, 99.co, Carro, StyleTheory, Glife, and Xfers, among others. 
 Quest Ventures said that the deal marks QazTech’s first investment in an Asian VC fund as it looks to tap into the increased business activities between Central Asia and Southeast Asia. 
 According to an earlier report by Kazakh publication  Strategy2050 , QazTech invested US$10 million into the new fund. Under the terms of the agreement, the fund will be considering startup projects in Kazakhstan and Central Asia in the next three years, the report said. 
 “This partnership with Quest Ventures and Pavilion Capital will enable Kazakhstani startups to secure important investments, improve competencies, and gain access to global markets,” said Adil Nurgozhin, the chairman of QazTech’s board. 
 Quest also announced its plans to launch an accelerator in Kazakhstan, aiming to spur the region’s digital economy. The program is set to back founders with disruptive business models that can create new sustainable values for the end customer. 
 In addition to Pavilion and QazTech, Fund II is also backed by entrepreneurs, C-suite executives, Asian family business founders, family offices, and institutional investors.

 The new funding round, which was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Lightspeed India, bumps up the company’s total funding to US$24 million, according to a statement. 
 Yellow Messenger looks to use the fresh capital to fuel international growth across Latin America and Asia Pacific, as well as new regions such as the US and Europe. 
 In addition, it plans to invest further in product innovation, which includes improving its bot’s multilingual voice capabilities and expanding enterprise integrations. Currently, its chatbots are available in over 120 languages, including Bahasa, Bengali, Cantonese, English, Hindi, and Thai. 
 The startup is also looking to launch a developer marketplace for virtual assistants, which will enable third-party developers to create, launch, and distribute their own chatbots to Yellow Messenger clients. 
 Through a partnership with Facebook Messenger, the company said it has recently been appointed by the National Health Authority of India to provide state governments with chatbots to help with citizen engagement amid the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Raghu Ravinutala, CEO and co-founder of Yellow Messenger, said that at this time, the startup has seen a surge in global demand from the banking, healthcare, food and beverage, retail, and ecommerce sectors as a result of the crisis. In response, the company has deployed special chatbots for enterprises tailored to drive business continuity. 
 Yellow Messenger was founded in 2017. It claims to have been growing 5x in bookings year on year since its establishment. It has over 100 clients globally, including companies such as Accenture, Flipkart, Grab, and Xiaomi India.

 Founded in 2016, Previse’s technology, called InstantPay, analyzes data from invoices that sellers send to their large corporate customers. Predictive analytics then identifies invoices that need intervention so the rest can be paid instantly. 
 The new funding will support the company’s growth as it rolls out InstantPay to more corporate buyers globally, Paul Christensen, the co-founder and CEO of Previse, said. 
 “Now more than ever, it is important to increase the resilience of supply chains and support SMEs that economies across the world depend on. The best way to do this is for large corporates to pay invoices fast,” said Christensen, adding that the company aims to see 5 million suppliers get paid instantly within the next five years. 
 To further its global ambitions, the startup has also cast its eye on the Asian market. The region constitutes the largest proportion of the world’s suppliers and SMEs, Christensen told  Tech in Asia . 
 Previse marks Reefknot’s second global investment. Last year, the joint venture made its  maiden investment  in UK-based AI startup Prowler, shortly after it announced its  US$50 million  fund for AI, deep tech, and trade finance opportunities.

644952,Biofourmis expands into oncology with Gaido Health acquisition," Digital therapeutics startup  Biofourmis  said it has reached an agreement to acquire US-based Gaido Health, a move that will allow the Singapore-born company to expand into the oncology space. 
 Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.

 Gaido Health provides an AI platform that monitors post-discharge oncology patients using wearables and machine learning. Its technology is designed to detect signs of complications early, allowing clinicians to be informed quickly and intervene in a timely manner. 
 The company was part of Takeda Digital Ventures, the investment arm of Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. 
 The acquisition will complement Biofourmis’ existing digital therapeutics portfolio, which covers heart failure and chronic pain, among others, CEO Kuldeep Singh Rajput said in a statement. 
 “Gaido was founded in 2018 to create new tools that assist caregivers in monitoring patients undergoing chemotherapy […]. Biofourmis will continue this vital work,” said Bruce Meadows, head of investments at Takeda Digital Ventures. 
 Prior to the acquisition, Gaido Health was already using Biofourmis’ wearable biosensor for home monitoring, according to a statement. 
 With the deal, Gaido Health’s system will be combined with Biofourmis’ flagship Biovitals platform, an AI-powered health analytics ecosystem that can predict clinical exacerbation using data from wearable sensors. The integration will be aimed at managing toxicities in patients undergoing CAR T-Cell Therapy, a form of immunotherapy that uses altered T cells, which are part of the immune system, to fight cancer. 
 According to Biofourmis, the total cost of CAR T-Cell therapy can be more than double the cost of the drug when factoring in post-therapy necessities. In the US alone, the total cost of care could rise to US$170 billion this year. Moreover, over 30% of patients on chemotherapy get readmitted to the hospital. 
 Rajput explained that by closely monitoring these groups of patients, care providers can improve outcomes and decrease readmission rates, leading to lower costs. 
 The acquisition will see Gaido Health’s CEO Gary Manning joining Biofourmis as senior vice president of corporate development, according to the statement. 
 Originally established in Singapore, Biofourmis moved its base to the US in May last year after securing  US$35 million  in series B funding. To date, the startup has raised about US$43.5 million since 2016, according to data from Crunchbase.

644640,How startups and investors can survive financially in any crisis," The Covid-19 outbreak, coupled with the oil shock has as of today resulted in a paralyzed, shell-shocked West and a winded East. 
 What I have learned going through the 2000 tech crash, 2003 SARS pandemic, and 2008 global financial crisis is that pendulums tend to swing to the extreme when aided by self-reinforcing fears and panic. This does not mean that we should be cavalier about things and just work on a best-case recovery assumption. Rather, it means we must recognize that this crisis, while large, is not a world-changer in any meaningful way.

 Yes, inept government officials may be voted out, people/companies will continue to go bankrupt, and, unfortunately, a lot of people will continue to die from the virus. But this will not change the world in the same way that democracy, religion, or even the internet did. 
 So what should we do as investors and startup founders? 
 For investors 
 First, investors should take it slow and easy and have a plan as the market gyrates. Cash is king, so invest how you see fit: Some people buy the way down, some buy the way up. But what is most important is not to over-leverage. Never put yourself in a situation where you have to sell a financial asset due to margin calls or daily expenses. For our situation, we have a hard cap of 28% on total leverage on all assets; you need to figure out yours. 
 Second, keep to your asset allocation. A balanced or conservative portfolio would actually have seen only a 3% to 10% drop year to date – that’s just part of last year’s gains. Compare this to stock market drops of 25% and some individual stock drops of 50% to 80%. 
 Third, keep diversifying and don’t own too much of one counter or industry. For me, this means you shouldn’t take a single stock risk of more than 5% of your portfolio. Personally, I am prepared to buy five times of exchange-traded funds, dividend stocks, and technology stocks from the S&amp;P 500 all the way from 3,000 to 1,200, and the Straits Times Index at 1,200. 
 This is below the levels of the global financial crisis substantially and, at that level, will involve some careful leveraging (30% maximum) and selling of bonds. It also involves being much pickier. Why buy stocks of speculative loss-making tech, like Eventbrite or Zendesk, when you can buy Apple, Alibaba, Facebook, Google, or Amazon stock at super discounted prices? This means that at the current S&amp;P 500 level, we have action plans for markets falling much further. 
 As for private equity investments like startups or venture capital funds, we have always espoused keeping to just 5% to 10% of net worth and putting them at book value. So these should continue, though maybe at a slower and more careful pace. 
 If you are investing in early-stage startups, I would argue that valuations will get better, and you can find quality founders in times of crisis. No “wantrepreneur” would run a startup during bad times! 
 For startups 
 Startups are in a much tougher situation. 
 A few will be lucky to have huge demand due to the sector they’re in (healthcare, delivery, cleaning services, etc.), but most will be in a reverse situation. 
 The most important thing I can share is to take action and take control of your destiny. Don’t hide, be passive, or be in denial. You need to act on revenue, cost, and cash flow to get past this period. 
 Second, estimate your cash flow. Make sure you have enough money to last at least 18 months. If you don’t, cut costs and drive revenue until you can. Assume that no more new investment money will be coming in, and at the same time, apply for credit facilities. 
 Even if you do have the cash, I suggest to still try to cut costs and extend your runway to 24 to 30 months. Do both a worst-case scenario and an average-case scenario planning. Then create trigger points where you would take certain actions. 
 Third, some actions you take should cut across all functions and levels so it is clear that the move is an effort by the entire company. Management has to lead by example, so if you have to cut salaries, cut your own first. 
 Cutting costs 
  Manpower costs : This includes reducing salaries, removing bonuses, implementing no-pay leaves, and decreasing headcount. 
  Marketing costs : Cut marketing expenses to make it commensurate to revenue. Don’t try to grow ahead or just rely on lifetime customer value math. For example, if you normally spend US$10,000 per month on conversions, try to spend US$6,000 or US$8,000 and just get the more profitable leads. 
  Other costs : See if you can make rent just 2% of your total expenses; ask yourself if you really need a downtown location or a co-working space. Another example would be staff welfare expenses, which, while not significant, do set the tone. Do you really need to spend more than US$200 per staff per year on welfare? A lot of team bonding activities can be done for free. 
  Cash flow management : Create packages that collect cash upfront, chase accounts receivables religiously, and don’t act like a bank for your clients. 
  Strategy : Stop overseas expansions and maybe close down new product lines or geographies that keep burning cash. 
  Talent : Top performers should still get recognized and paid well, maybe even given bonuses and increases. Use this opportunity to remove bad performers. 
 The above areas are all linked to cost. In my experience, cutting these helps you become more efficient, and a downturn is a good reason to test your efficiency. What is critical is that you communicate the reason for all these changes. This will be a good time to see if your staff trusts you and whether you have built a good culture of teamwork and togetherness. 
 On the revenue side 
 If your startup has product-market fit already, the one thing you don’t cut is performing sales. If you can sell your way aggressively out of a recession, your sales tend to become even stronger. 
 This is also an opportunity to fire bad clients and replace them with safer ones in terms of payment terms. Remember Honestbee? Clients can always fold and back out from paying. 
 Sometimes, you just have bad luck. For example, you’re in a sector that has been heavily affected, such as travel or tourism. This means your leadership and strategy matter even more. As a small startup, you have huge overhead and cost advantages over bigger competitors who will be burning even more cash, and this would be the best time to undercut and outsell them. If you have sufficient cash in the bank, this might be the best time to grow market share. 
 One caveat: If you find yourself mentally breaking down due to stress, or if it’s clear that your cash balance is not going to make it, there is no shame in calling it quits and shutting down. Assess your risk properly; don’t wait until you owe employees and fellow startup owners lots of money. 
 I hope this was useful. My cost-cutting strategies may be a bit extreme, but it’s actually how most profitable small and medium-sized enterprises run. It’s time our startups learn to do the same. Who knows, maybe we’ll have a surge of profitable startups emerging once the winter ends.

644922,Unicorns face a reckoning after doling out generous salaries in boom time," As a recruiter, David Bolton has a ringside seat to the inflated salaries that tech firms often offer their employees. 
 “We had a case last year where a guy with a couple of years of experience was currently on four grand a month with the company,” Bolton, an associate director at recruitment agency Space Executive’s technology and transformation practice, tells  Tech in Asia . After being interviewed and doing “really well” on the tech test, the company doubled the candidate’s salary, he shares. 
   
 The firm in question was a Southeast Asian tech unicorn, says Bolton, who focuses on hiring executive and C-level staff. Competing startups, meanwhile, were offering the candidate about a 15% to 20% salary increase. This disparity, he says, applies from junior roles, senior hires, to tech leads. 
 When it comes to hiring the best talent, businesses in Southeast Asia – startups and tech giants alike – have been pulling out all the stops. But this may now be screeching to a halt as firms reassess labor costs amid a pandemic-induced recession that has already forced industry-wide layoffs in sectors like travel and hospitality. 
 Funding for startups in the region  ended on a high note  at the close of 2019, creating a new wave of tech unicorns. As they grew, many of these companies had to compete for the same talent as tech titans like Facebook, Google, and Alibaba, who have led the way in offering glitzy salary packages. 
 For smaller startups that are less flushed with cash, forking out outsized wages upfront – even for a highly skilled candidate – can be out of the question, leading to a brain drain in favor of bigger enterprises. During a recession, these firms are further disadvantaged, as they’re forced to make cutbacks even as tech giants continue on their hunt for talent. 
 One reason that bigger firms offer huge increases in pay is the short supply for certain technical workers. For instance, proficiency in modern programming languages such as  Golang  and  Node.js  has been sought after, says Bolton. Companies have been seeking such talent from abroad in recent years, he adds. 
 Even before the pandemic, candidates with “very niche skills” could already command up to a 60% increase in salary, Shinjika Shukla, an associate director at recruitment firm Michael Page, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Collecting talent 
 To acquire top employees, rich tech multinationals will make every effort – sometimes to an extreme. Unprofitable tech unicorns have had to match them or risk losing out on the cream of the crop. 
 A founder from a mid-sized startup tells  Tech in Asia  about how the firm lost “two of its best people” to a big tech company even though there was no real need for them there. 
 “[The employees] went there, but there was nothing to do. All [the tech company] wanted was to make sure [a competitor] didn’t get them,” says the founder, who did not want to be named. Unicorns have followed suit, hiring with the idea that money will be free-flowing, the CEO adds.

 Recruiters  Tech in Asia  spoke to say such hiring practices are typical. Tech juggernauts like Google are known to build a pipeline of incredibly strong talent, so even if they’re not hiring for a role at that moment, they still seek to connect with potential candidates, said a Singapore-based recruiter who wished to stay anonymous. 
 Of course, new unicorns aren’t rich enough to hire people just for the sake of it, but they’re still offering generous packages. A human resource executive, who had worked for a major ecommerce company, tells  Tech in Asia  on the condition of anonymity that there was “no cap to hiring costs” at the firm. “There was never a spreadsheet that captures manpower cost,” the executive says. 
 While the startup sector benchmarks its salaries at roughly 25% less than the traditional industry in exchange for equity, tech titans are paying higher than the previous jobs by at least 25%. This means that “they’re paying 50% higher than the startup pay,” the anonymous founder claims. 
 The caveat? These inflated pay packages may not come with job satisfaction. 
 “If you ask people who actually work at these businesses, even at the very senior level, what they’ll tell you is that they are all very individual gears in a much, much larger machine,” says Suraj Laungani, an associate director for startup recruitment at Space Executive. “That’s the price they’re paying to have that brand name on their CVs – to have that kind of compensation.” 
 A primary complaint of these workers is that they have no impact, he adds. 
 Competing for top talent 
 Fast-growing technology firms like Grab and Razer aren’t just competing for technical talent. As they blitz into new business areas such as financial services, they’re also fighting for former investment bankers, private equity specialists, or ex-management consultants – people who could be a big help as they navigate new regulatory or financial territory. 
 Such candidates will often fill roles in corporate strategy, become corporate development heads, or even a finance or growth lead, especially if fundraising is part of the equation. Navigating Southeast Asia also requires talent who can maneuver legal and political minefields.

 An early-stage employee might have helped to build a company from the ground up, but that might not be the same person with the skills to scale the business later on. “It’s a completely different skill set,” says Laungani. 
 “When you’re at one and you need to get to 10, you need to bring in an investment banker to help you with that next round to fundraise, because that’s the profile that you need in front of your potential investor,” he adds. 
 Case in point, Hong Kong-listed Razer  hired Neal Cross , the former chief innovation officer at DBS Bank, as an advisory board member last December, just before the lifestyle gaming company made an  official bid for a digital banking license  in Singapore. 
 For startups, the ability to offer high salaries upfront is purely a function of how much runway they have. With ride-hailing unicorn Grab raising over US$8.8 billion to date, it’s no surprise that it’s known for its high-paying tech roles. 
 “We benchmark our competitive compensation packages to the wider technology industry in order to draw the best global talent,” said a Grab spokesperson. 
 Birds of the same feather 
 As high-level executives depart for tech companies, they tend to take like-minded colleagues along with them, creating a knock-on effect of attracting more well-compensated hires. 
 “I know without them having to say it that [founders] will be drawn more to a candidate who has spent two years in Boston Consulting Group, Bain &amp; Company, and McKinsey &amp; Company and then stepped out and done something else, as opposed to somebody who hasn’t,” a senior recruiter, who does placements for senior leadership roles across startups and venture capital firms, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 For instance, Loic Gautier, part of the  growing Lazada mafia , co-founded the Vietnamese ecommerce site  Leflair  together with fellow ex-Lazadian Pierre-Antoine Brun. 
 “We hire a lot of ex-Lazada, ex-Rocket Internet [people] as a whole – it’s a great pool of talent,” Gautier told  Tech in Asia  previously.

 But this hiring practice could lead to the hiring more high-profile candidates demanding big titles and inflated salaries, says a former executive who has done recruitment for multiple Southeast Asian unicorns. 
 “If you’re not from an Ivy League college – not from Uber, Gojek – you’re different,” the executive added. 
 Hiring during a pandemic 
 Startups are already feeling the impacts of Covid-19: Dealmaking in February was  down 26%  from the same month in 2019. And as private equity and venture capital firms  pull back on investing , unprofitable unicorns may find it more difficult to attract and retain talent. 
 Following last year’s WeWork debacle, businesses had to rejig their compensation packages as they shifted their priorities toward hitting profitability, Laungani says. 
 The move is a 360-degree turn from hiring practices from just a year ago. 
 Despite the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, hires with top credentials at tech juggernauts are still somewhat sheltered. But “lower-level” employees are often the first to be affected in any layoff exercise, just  like what happened at Traveloka . 
 The outbreak has shined a light on companies’ human resource policies and practices. But for the most part, firms are likely to continue with strategic hires as they keep current projects going. 
 A quick search on the websites of top tech unicorns shows that companies including Lazada, Sea Group, and Grab continue to hire for essential roles like backend developers and full-stack engineers, which are among the top most in-demand jobs in Singapore, according to LinkedIn data as of December 2019.

 Chinese technology firm Bytedance is “still hiring and expanding in Singapore across various job functions,” a company spokesperson tells  Tech in Asia . The company behind the popular short video app TikTok is seeking to  fill 10,000 positions  globally despite the uncertainties brought on by the pandemic. 
 Meanwhile, giants with deep pockets like Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, and Tencent could use this as an opportunity to snap up talent, even as unprofitable tech unicorns cut back. 
 Companies in general, however, are expected to take a more conservative approach in the current climate. “They will want to ensure that when they hire someone, they want to be able to offer long-term and stable employment,” Michael Page’s Shukla says.

644631,TIA Monthly Report: Strong March masks weakness in the early funding stages,"     
 ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
 March has been a pretty strong month for Asian tech funding, with only a 10% decline from the year before – despite the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 This is thanks in large part to hefty late-stage deal activities like Gojek’s  US$1.2 billion raise , which was in the works since last year. 
 Further alleviating the strain, Chinese tech giant Tencent made nine deals this month, matching its pace in 2019. 
 Early-stage activity from seed to series C remains soft, however, echoing sentiments that the outbreak has spooked venture capital firms. 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
 Despite the economy being in the doldrums, there are still plenty of buyers hunting for a good deal, especially in the late stages. 
 While cash-poor startups may be struggling, wealthier tech giants still have the firepower to make investments in a downturn. They certainly have the leverage to demand lower valuations and terms that favor them. 
 Expect M&amp;A activity to pick up in the coming months.

644705,Why Philippine ecommerce still relies on convenience stores," In an emerging market like the Philippines, being “online” means more than simply having a digital presence. Having ecommerce enablers is just as important, and it’s a unique aspect of this market. 
 In much of the country, especially in rural areas, infrastructure remains an issue. Aside from faulty internet service, logistics companies find it difficult to access plenty of homes due to the lack of good roads. Outside urban areas, shipping services remain expensive, at times costing as much as 10% of the total value of the items bought online.

 Ecommerce platforms and startups have addressed this problem by setting up pickup points, usually a central establishment like a mall or a convenience store, where customers can collect the goods they’ve ordered online. Some of these places have even turned into “digital hubs,” where shoppers can be assisted by an agent who will make the online purchase for them. 
 Exhibit A: The country’s largest convenience store, 7-Eleven, has installed point-of-sale (POS) counters in every branch under the brand CLiQQ. Initially meant for the online payment of bills, from monthly electricity dues to airline tickets, CLiQQ eventually introduced an ecommerce service that allows shoppers to buy products that are not usually found in a convenience store, such as socks and makeup. The items would then be shipped to the branch to be picked up by the customer after a few days. 
 Digital services aggregator Posible.net has also enabled small neighborhood retailers, or what Filipinos call  sari-sari  stores, to be “malls” in their own right through the Posible app, which allows  sari-sari  store operators to order goods online on behalf of customers. The platform was also initially developed for payment services, but two years after its launch, CEO JG Puzon saw another potential for it: agent-assisted ecommerce. 
 “To give you context, our partners are usually [located] in innermost roads. In the provinces, this means we are not [on] the same street as convenience stores or malls. In urban areas, this means we are in areas where most shoppers may not have formal addresses,” Puzon explains. “This means we are catering to two types of customers that logistics companies can’t serve: the ones outside of their reach, and the ones that they should be able to but can’t, just because they’re not on the map.”

 Currently, Posible’s ecommerce site lets customers order anything, from personal care products to small furniture and appliances. Interestingly, one of the most ordered items through the platform are monobloc chairs. “And these are [from] customers located near malls. They simply don’t want the hassle of commuting and lugging that big of an item around,” Puzon says. 
 In both cases, instead of delivering orders to homes that may be too costly to reach, ecommerce sites could just drop off items in established stores that are usually found in a more accessible area in a rural town. The popularity of this system points to an issue that’s often overlooked, which is the Filipinos’ distrust of ecommerce. 
 According to a study, a number of Filipinos still doubt the legitimacy of goods being sold online – and it’s a valid concern. Even the country’s two biggest online shopping platforms, Shopee and Lazada, have put up “malls” to help shoppers differentiate official product distributors from small shops that may not always sell goods sourced from legitimate distributors. 
 For Puzon, services like Posible’s somehow alleviate the doubt Filipino customers have for online services since transactions are facilitated by a person they trust, such as the owner of the  sari-sari  store at the street corner. 
 For these services, items are paid offline, which could be seen as contradictory to ecommerce’s premise of convenience and reliability. But in the Philippines, as in most emerging digital markets, the presence of an authority figure – whether an establishment or a person – is still needed to assure the customer that a transaction was made. This reflects the central bank of the Philippines’ findings that despite their awareness of e-wallets, majority of Filipino internet users still don’t use them due to safety and security concerns. 
 For the foreseeable future, hybrid commerce, or ecommerce that relies on the services of offline channels, will still be evident in countries like the Philippines. Physical components are still needed for the market to be able to adapt to ecommerce entirely, and they will remain important to brands who wish to build a bigger presence in the age of online shopping.

 A third of these openings are high-level research or software coding jobs,  Bloomberg  wrote, adding that new hires will support Bytedance’s ecosystem of apps like TikTok and Jinri Toutiao, among other platforms, also boosting the firm’s operation in new verticals like gaming and ecommerce. 
 The founder of the valuable startup, Zhang Yiming, first mentioned last month in an internal memo the company’s intention to reach 100,000 staff in total by the end of 2020,  KrAsia  reported. 
 “In the past eight years, Bytedance has grown rapidly, from a small product to a platform that provides service to users around the world,” Zhang said. 
 Currently, the company has 60,000 employees in more than 180 cities and 30 countries around the world, with services covering 150 countries and regions.

644771,Philippine cloud kitchen startup CloudEats nets $1.4m in seed round,"  CloudEats , a cloud kitchen startup based in the Philippines, announced that it has raised US$1.4 million in a seed funding round. 
 According to its announcement, the round was led by local family offices with large stakes in real estate and food and beverage industries. Regional angel investors also participated.

 CloudEats, which was launched in June last year, develops its cloud kitchens in non-retail and cost-efficient spaces, with operations and layouts specifically designed for food delivery. It currently has five cloud kitchens in the Philippines that house 70 in-house restaurant brands. 
 It claims its food brands offer 15% to 20% lower prices compared to competitors. 
 The company will use the new funds to further expand across the Philippines and Southeast Asia and is in the process of increasing the number of its cloud kitchens in the archipelago to 20, Kimberly Yao, the co-founder and CEO at CloudEats, told  Tech in Asia . 
 The startup also plans to build more than 100 kitchens and offer its in-house brands in at least four countries across the region within the next two years. “We plan to open in the countries with highest online food delivery penetration across Southeast Asia,” Yao said, adding that the industry is in its infancy globally, especially in the region. 
 One familiar name in the space is GrabKitchen, the cloud kitchen business of regional super app Grab. The service currently operates in countries like Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, as well as the Philippines to provide Grab’s merchant partners a platform where they can introduce new food concepts and brands. 
 According to Yao, CloudEats is unlike GrabKitchen, as it does not lease kitchen spaces to third parties. Rather, the startup operates its own kitchens for its in-house restaurant brands. 
 “As we grow, we may be potential customers for the growing cloud kitchen companies and enhance the food delivery ecosystem further,” she said. 
 As of March this year, CloudEats has reached over 3,000 orders a day, the company said. Its products are available through food delivery platforms such as GrabFood, Foodpanda, and Lalafood. 
 To help frontliners battling the Covid-19 pandemic, the startup has also started a charity food drive and was able to raise 55,000 meal donations.

644769,"India’s Zomato may acquire SoftBank-backed Grofers, report says","  Zomato , one of the two major Indian food delivery startups that just got its hands on grocery and daily essentials delivery since last month seems to want a firmer grip in the playground, as the Gurugram-based company is reportedly in talks with grocery startup Grofers for a possible acquisition. 
 Both Zomato and Grofers are backed by Sequoia Capital. 
 
  Photo credit:  Piotr Trojanowski  
 
 Local media  Economic Times , citing two sources, said both the companies are in discussions for an all-stock deal, which would value Grofers at US$750 million. 
 Zomato has, however, denied any such talks. “We have partnered with Grofers, along with FMCG companies, local grocery stores, and modern retail chains, to pilot our grocery delivery service. We are not aware of any other conversation with Grofers,” a Zomato spokesperson said and quoted in the same   report. 
 In mid-March, seeing the demand for grocery delivery shooting through the roof as Covid-19 forced the country to go under lockdown, Zomato swiftly decided to partner with Grofers to try its hand in the soon-to-be US$10.5 billion e-grocery space. 
 “They have been engaged in talks [with Grofers] over the past few weeks, sensing a big opportunity in the grocery segment. Their pilot run across Delhi-NCR seems to have clocked high order numbers to start with further strengthening the ongoing negotiations,” one of the sources told  Economic Times . “Zomato had also held talks with BigBasket for a potential merger, but the talks were preliminary.” 
 SoftBank Vision Fund (SVF) might invest anywhere between US$100 million and US$200 million in the merged entity. While SVF is the majority shareholder in Grofers, its portfolio company Uber owns a 10% stake in Zomato after the latter acquired Uber’s food delivery operation, Uber Eats, in India for US$350 million. 
 If the deal goes through, Zomato would be able to tap into the wide range of private labels that Grofers manufactures, while leveraging its last-mile delivery expertise to rise to the top in the grocery space, which is currently dominated by Alibaba-backed e-grocer BigBasket. 
 With the US$100 million to US$200 million of additional capital that SoftBank will put in the merged entity, Zomato will be able to give a tough competition to BigBasket, Naspers-backed Swiggy, and online retailers such as Amazon and Flipkart, which have been focusing on delivery of essential items as the lockdown has suspended their larger ecommerce operations for the time being. 
 With an eye on Grofers, the homegrown food delivery giant is aiming for a bigger pie in this rapidly growing segment. The proposed deal would take Zomato on par with Swiggy, which entered hyperlocal delivery space with the acquisition of milk delivery startup Supr Daily in 2018 and doubled down on the segment last year with its twin hyperlocal services: Swiggy Stores and Swiggy Go. 
 On Monday, Swiggy said it has expanded its delivery of groceries and household essential services to over 125 cities. 
 “The service is being fulfilled through neighborhood stores and distribution centers of large brands,” the company said in a statement. It has partnered with several national brands and retailers such as Hindustan Unilever, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Godrej, Dabur, Marico, and Cipla, among others, to supply branded essentials and food items. 
 Swiggy has also revamped its pickup and delivery service Swiggy Go by launching a hyperlocal delivery service, Genie, in over 15 cities, the company said.

644755,Singapore startup that creates healthier versions of your favorite food bags funding," It’s common to have a love-hate relationship with our favorite unhealthy snacks. After all, treats like ice cream, packaged baked goods, and sugary instant beverages are high in calories and wreak havoc on our overall health. 
  Hoow Foods  plans to change this. Launched in 2018, the company uses what it calls food reformulation technology to create healthier versions of certain food products while retaining their taste and texture. 
 Today, the Singapore-based foodtech startup announced that it has raised an undisclosed amount of strategic funding in a round led by local family office Nanyang Realty. 
 South Korean venture capital funds Sunbo Angel Partners and Lighthouse Combined Investment also participated in the round.

 “This strategic investment will allow Hoow Foods to tap into our various networks, especially our hospitality and real estate investments both locally and overseas, to further demonstrate and grow their current capabilities,” said Ken Ang of Nanyang Realty, which has diverse business interests in the hospitality, real estate, and shipping industries. 
 Hoow Foods has to date formulated healthier versions of desserts, baked goods, beverages, and sauces, and it even has its own ice cream brand called Callery’s, which has more than 70% less calories, fat, and sugar compared to other ice cream brands. 
 The company uses a technology called Re-Genesys. It’s a machine learning-enabled platform that breaks down and analyzes existing products, modifies their formulations to preserve or even enhance their taste and texture, and alters their nutritional profiles to create a healthier product. 
 The startup’s 10-member team plans to use the new funds to expand its science team, enhance its technology infrastructure, and accelerate its operations and research and development capabilities in the region, according to a statement. 
 The company said it has also completed the commercialization of its products through its collaboration with Singapore heritage brand Killiney Group. With the partnership, the two firms co-developed several new merchandises this year, including milk tea and reformulated white coffee products, and are working on new flavors and healthier versions of instant beverages. 
 The move is in line with the government’s plan to ban certain less healthy ingredients, as well as the upcoming grading system for pre-packaged drinks, according to the company. 
 In September last year, the startup raised  US$1.2 million  in seed funding from Killiney Group, Singapore government-backed food incubator Innovate360, Trive Ventures, and other angel investors. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(1, 0.8816445), (2, 0.11809889)]","['Callery', 'foodtech']",['Singapore']
644721,Commentary: Should Masayoshi Son step away from SoftBank Group?," Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group is among the high-profile casualties of the Covid-19 pandemic as many of its well-publicized technology bets have begun to unravel. In a recent  interview with  Forbes  , founder Masayoshi Son said that 15 of the 88 portfolio companies in the SoftBank Vision Fund are likely to go bankrupt. But he also believes that another 15 companies should succeed. 
 What’s happening to SoftBank shows how the nature of technology venture investing may not always suit a listed company, considering the close media scrutiny and daily market fluctuations that it entails. It’s actually pretty normal that many venture-style investments will go bust, but a few investments can become home runs for the portfolio and deliver outsized returns, which could more than compensate for the portfolio companies that fail. 
 Indeed, despite the trouble with co-working firm  WeWork , money lost on ride-hailer Uber, and problems with smaller but still noteworthy investments such as Indian hospitality startup  Oyo , SoftBank Group’s total asset value is largely based on Son’s spectacularly successful early bet on Alibaba. As shown below, more than half of SoftBank Group’s asset value stems from its stake in the Chinese giant, paying  off massively and making up for most of Son’s underperforming investments. 
 
  Sources: Softbank Group, Pitchbook, Zero One estimates Note: Public assets valued as of April 13, 2020. Private assets valued as of February 12, 2020. 
 
 In addition to Alibaba, SoftBank Group derives a significant portion of its asset value from SoftBank Telecom and its stake in Sprint Telecom in the US, which has now merged with T-Mobile. The Tokyo-headquartered conglomerate also has a direct stake in satellite broadband operator OneWeb, which  filed for bankruptcy  last month. 
 It’s SoftBank Vision Fund’s (SVF) investments that are generating the majority of negative press and headaches for Son. On Monday, SoftBank Group  said  that it expects a US$16.7 billion loss on SVF and a US$7.4 billion loss on other investments, including WeWork and OneWeb, in the financial year ended March 2020. 
 SVF has direct stakes in the group’s other troubled investments such as  Oyo . This means that most of the damage from Son’s recent investment missteps has largely been borne by SVF investors and Son’s personal reputation rather than SoftBank Group’s actual asset value. The company’s inherent asset value has been far less affected by these mistakes, even if the general stock market decline has hurt Softbank Group’s share price. 
 More bad news? 
 Nevertheless, because of all the bad publicity and uncertainty about what could come next, SoftBank Group’s share price trades at a deep discount to the sum of all its assets. This means that the shares would be worth far more if the conglomerate were liquidated into separate individual companies and Son didn’t make new risky investments. 
 As shown below, the company’s share price is estimated to be trading at a 60% discount versus the net sum of its assets based on recent market prices and data from SoftBank Group’s last earnings announcement. This means that if its shares would simply reflect the value of its underlying assets, they could rally by about 150%. Put another way, if Son stepped down and announced that he would liquidate Softbank Group, then its shares could rally 150% just to reflect the value of what investors would receive in distribution. 
 
  Sources: Softbank Group, Pitchbook, Zero One estimates Note: Public assets valued as of April 13, 2020. Private assets valued as of February 12, 2020. 
 
 To be clear, SoftBank Group has traded below the value of its assets by some discount for a long time already, which can be common for many conglomerates listed on the stock market. Such companies usually trade at some discount to their assets. 
 However, the collapse of Son’s bullish bets has resulted in substantial share price volatility for SoftBank Group, making it trade at a deeper discount to the sum of its assets than should normally be the case even for a listed conglomerate. Investors are increasingly concerned over its debt, with Standard &amp; Poor’s cutting the company’s credit rating outlook to  negative . 
 Hence, it makes sense that activist investors such as  Elliott Management Corp.  have been pressuring Son to do less vision-based investing and more old-fashioned monetization. This has led SoftBank Group to announce a US$41 billion asset sale aimed at funding a share buyback and slashing debt. 
 Tempered risk-taking 
 The company’s shares rose sharply on the news and could likely climb higher if it announced further asset sales to buy back shares so that its investors can finally realize its asset value as cash. 
 While Son seems to be moving away from dicey investments, having  canceled  a further US$3 billion investment in WeWork earlier this month, SoftBank shares might better off right now if he simply stepped down. It seems that market concern about his penchant for uber-bullish failed investments is hurting share price, as the company is worth far less than it should be relative to the sum of its assets. 
 Thus if Son steps down, the company’s shares would likely go up substantially, given how deeply they trade to their net asset value. While this seems an extreme measure, it isn’t when one considers how the founders of Uber, Google and Microsoft have taken on less active executive roles, and the companies later thrived as a result. 
 The market seems to want less risk-taking from SoftBank Group right now, so it wouldn’t be too crazy if Son took a backseat for a bit. Stepping down could be in shareholders’ interest because if the market doesn’t need to worry about new aggressive investments from the company, then its stock could rally.

644739,"Indonesia’s online lenders tighten credit screening, cut jobs amid loan default risks"," After demonstrating rapid growth in recent years, Indonesia’s online lenders are now turning cautious, as the Covid-19 pandemic might make it difficult for borrowers to pay back their loans. 
 Tapping into the country’s huge unbanked population enabled lending startups such as Akulaku and Modalku  to scale fast . But they are now shifting gears, as many of their customers have lost their jobs or were  furloughed with no pay . 
 Companies, especially startups and small and medium-sized enterprises, are falling on  hard times  as they grapple with the pandemic’s economic impact. Reynold Wijaya, CEO of Modalku, says that some of the company’s SME borrowers are  applying for payment rescheduling  due to  worsening economic conditions . 
 While the company implements loan restructuring on a case-by-case basis, it looks to maximize lending opportunities for specific industries that are still doing well. 
 “We will also maximize collaboration with ecommerce platforms with many microeconomy sellers,” says Wijaya. “In this physical distancing condition, ecommerce businesses can grow well because people prefer to buy things online, such as daily needs and medicine.” 
 Silver lining 
 Despite the  economic fallout from Covid-19 , consumer lenders see a silver lining: People who have lost their jobs or had their salaries cut are increasingly turning to loans to supplement their reduced incomes, according to consumer lending platforms like Akulaku, Kredivo, and UangTeman. However, to mitigate credit risk, the three companies said they’ve decided to tighten their screening process. 
 “The number of applicants on our platform has increased 40%,” says a representative from UangTeman. “We’re lucky that we have implemented a tight credit analysis process with an AI machine, so our approval rate is only 20%.” 
 But as the economy stalls, achieving profitability this year would be more difficult, UangTeman CEO Aidil Zulkifli  previously said . 
 “The target applies when everything is normal – without an economic downturn.” The company has also delayed the launch of its shariah product and its planned expansion in the Philippines. 
 Job cuts at Akulaku 
 There’s no available industry data to vividly paint the outbreak’s impact on online lenders in Indonesia, but Akulaku says it has already slowed down hiring. 
 “We believe it is the best [response] whilst maintaining our business operation,” William Li, co-founder and CEO of Akulaku, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 The company, however, has laid off hundreds of its employees in the beginning of April, some of the retrenched staff members tell  Tech in Asia . According to the sources, the company said it made the decision as many customers were unable to pay back their loans due to the pandemic.

 Li says that the cut was part of “team optimization,” where the company lets go of employees that demonstrated weak performance. “Coronavirus affects the business, but we have no plan to reduce our people massively,” he says. 
 While Li neither confirmed nor denied the number of people that were laid off, he said that around 10% of the company’s employees either voluntarily leave or are let go every year due to performance issues. Akulaku, which is backed by Ant Financial and Sequoia Capital, had 2,500 employees at the beginning of this year. 
 The retrenched employees say that their supervisors and Akulaku’s HR team didn’t talk about performance issues when the layoffs were announced. 
 Li, a former investment manager at Ping An Insurance, and ex-Tencent software engineer Gordon Hu founded Akulaku in 2016. Within a year since its launch, the company acquired 1 million registered users in the archipelago. 
 Investor’s trust 
 Despite the crisis, venture capital firms are still injecting fresh funds into online lending in Indonesia. In the past week,  Investree  and  KoinWorks  have announced over US$20 million in funding each from prominent investors like EV Growth, BRI Ventures, Quona Capital, and the VC arm of Japanese bank MUFG. 
 Nicko Widjaja, CEO of BRI Ventures, acknowledges the pandemic’s impact on fintech businesses, especially those that cater to the services sector. However, he still believes in the industry, noting that the foundation of Indonesia’s economy is strong enough. 
 “After seeing statistics from several fintech startups in the country, I am sure that the demand will grow again,” Widjaja says. “If they survive this situation, then they will be proven to be agile and ready to be on the path to profitability.” ",Aditya Hadi Pratama,0,3,"[(0, 0.6532327), (2, 0.34664956)]","['VC', 'fintech', 'KoinWorks', 'AI', 'Coronavirus', 'Wijaya', 'UangTeman', 'Modalku']","['Asia', 'Akulaku', 'Kredivo', 'Philippines', 'Tech', 'Indonesia']"
644692,Singapore AI startup providing ecommerce data raises funds to scale in SEA,"  Digital Commerce Intelligence (DCI) , a Singapore-based AI startup offering real-time ecommerce data, announced that it has secured S$1 million (US$706,000) from Athens-based Velocity Partners to scale its services across Southeast Asia. 
 
  DCI founder and CEO Kyriakos Zannikos/ Photo credit: DCI 
 
 According to the company, there are more than 2 million independent sellers operating across the region who can collectively trade over 50% of a brand’s total ecommerce sales. However, many operate without the brands’ knowledge, making commercial planning and brand management more challenging. 
 The Covid-19 crisis amplified this problem, as demand for certain products do not necessarily reflect the demand from forecasting. 
 Founded in 2018, DCI uses data science and AI to provide ecommerce market performance insights and intelligence for consumer goods brands and retailers in Southeast Asia. It aggregates online product data across ecommerce platforms and uses AI algorithm to identify market trends, establish benchmarks among key competitors, and produce commercial insights. 
 The company said the solution enables brands to act fast and plan their productions to ensure adequate inventory across their supply chains. By keeping track of ecommerce performance fundamentals, brands can also gain insights into their ecommerce market share and retailers’ dynamics, as well as monitor competitors’ strategies. 
 “What makes a brand a leader is often the wise use of data,” said Kyriakos Zannikos, founder and CEO of DCI. “This is particularly true in ecommerce, where the pace and dynamics of trade are so much faster than any other commercial channel.” 
 DCI also has an office in Greece, Athens, according to its website.

644661,Payments company 2C2P launches VC arm," Singapore- and Bangkok-based payments platform  2C2P  said it has set up a new investment arm to invest in fintech opportunities across Southeast Asia. 
 
  Photo credit: 2C2P 
 
 Called 2C2P.VC, the new entity is headquartered in Singapore and will be led by Eva Weber, who recently joined 2C2P’s management team as an investment director. Previously, Weber held several positions at companies such as Merrill Lynch, IFC, Naspers, and Adyen. 
 Weber told  Tech in Asia  that with 2C2P.VC, the company will focus on strengthening its core markets in the region, including Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Singapore. Additionally, the investment arm will be keeping an eye out for companies that can help it expand outside Southeast Asia. 
 “We evaluate each opportunity and determine the investment size and level of involvement we want to have accordingly. Generally speaking, we look to take a minority stake, with the view of increasing our stake over time,” Weber added. 
 According to 2C2P founder and group CEO Aung Kyaw Moe, the company sees 2C2P.VC as a “critical component” in its growth. The head exec noted that the company has been eyeing a number of firms that align with its strategy, particularly in terms of their technologies, products, or geographic presence in markets 2C2P plans to penetrate.

644651,SoftBank expects over $16b Vision Fund loss," Japan’s SoftBank Group forecasts a US$12.1 billion operating loss for the year ended March 31, 2020 as it sees a decline in value of its tech investments and a “deteriorating market environment.”

 The company said it expects a US$16.7 billion loss on its Vision Fund and a US$7.4 billion loss on other investments, including co-working startup WeWork and satellite telecommunications company OneWeb, which just filed for bankruptcy. 
 “This will be partially offset by the gain relating to the settlement of variable prepaid forward contract using Alibaba shares recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the dilution gain from changes in equity interest in Alibaba recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, as well as an expected year-on-year increase in income on equity method investments related to Alibaba,” SoftBank said in a statement. 
 Oyo, one of SoftBank’s biggest bets, has also caught some trouble amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Ritesh Agarwal, the founder and group CEO at Oyo, recently announced  furloughs and pay cuts  to ensure long-term cash runway. Agarwal said the company’s revenue and occupancies have dropped by over 50% to 60%. 
  See also:  Masayoshi Son’s investment woes worsen with Oyo layoffs   
 Meanwhile, there are reports that SoftBank’s second Vision Fund would be frozen. Vision Fund 2, announced in July last year, is expected to raise at least US$108 million. However, the company has been looking to  scale back  its plans for the second mega fund due to a series of incidents involving WeWork and Uber. 
 “At the moment, I think that our next fund size should be a little bit smaller because we have caused concerns and anxiety to a lot of people,” SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said in the company’s Q3 earnings presentation in February. 
 Late last year, SoftBank completed the initial close for Vision Fund 2 at  just US$2 billion . The company was reportedly  struggling  to raise funds for the new fund amid the woes related to WeWork.

644669,Prepare to ride out this pandemic-triggered recession until 2022," Dear readers, 
 There will eventually be a light at the end of this dark tunnel, but until glimmers of recovery begin to shine through, startups will have to be conservative with their expectations. 
 As startups struggle to survive the  economic fallout  from Covid-19, companies will have to adapt  stricter financial discipline , while pivoting their businesses. 
 Amit Saberwal, founder and CEO of Singapore-based hospitality firm RedDoorz, and Dimitra Taslim, an investor at GGV Capital, spoke last week at  Tech in Asia ’s virtual panel discussion where they shared their views on how startups can pull through the pandemic. Their advice: Prepare for the worst.

 Startups in the travel sector are among the hardest hit,  and RedDoorz has taken  tough measures  to stay afloat. The company has reduced costs and budgeted for zero revenue growth in the next 12 months to extend its runway to mid-2022, Saberwal says. 
 While RedDoorz shed less than 10% of its manpower, froze hiring, and slashed management salaries, Saberwal emphasized that startups should make the right adjustments because if you cut too much now, it’s going to be difficult to rebuild teams once recovery comes. 
 Apart from cost-cutting measures, startups also need to look internally for operational improvements they can implement while waiting for the recovery, says GGV’s Taslim. Many Chinese startups did that during the 2003 SARS outbreak and came out stronger, he says. For instance, ecommerce giant Alibaba launched customer-to-customer marketplace  Taobao  during that period. GGV was among the early investors in Alibaba.

 Other participating investors include Sequoia India and Southeast Asia, Intudo Ventures, Coca-Cola Amatil, Agaeti Convergence Ventures, Alter Global, and Mirae Asset Venture Investment, according to a statement. Kargo has also secured debt financing from undisclosed regional banks and financial institutions as part of the round. 
 The new funding comes as the startup launches initiatives to help companies in Indonesia fight the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Kargo said its employees will be seeding a US$1 million logistics relief fund for truckers moving essential supplies. Its co-founders and leadership team will pour up to 75% of their salaries into the fund, while CEO Tiger Fang will contribute 100% of his annual pay. Kargo has  opened the fund  to anyone willing to donate. 
 In addition, the startup has also partnered with charitable organizations to deliver meals and essential medical supplies to healthcare workers and patients across hospitals in Jakarta. 
 Kargo also said it has been taking extra precautions to keep drivers safe during the outbreak. For one, it has implemented an electronic proof-of-delivery system on its platform to limit physical contact. It has also been disinfecting and stocking up pit stops on its routes with essential supplies. 
 “Whether it’s keeping retail shelves stocked with minimal human contact or making ecommerce orders more fluid across the nation, our team believes we can help solve this problem,” said Yodi Aditya, Kargo’s chief technology officer. 
 Fang and Aditya founded Kargo in 2018. Prior to Kargo, Fang had held key positions at Uber, Rocket Internet, and Lazada. Meanwhile, Aditya has worked with aircraft route optimization, enterprise software, and real-time payment technology. 
 Last year, Kargo raised  US$7.6 million  in a seed round led by Sequoia Capital India.

 Kumu plans to use the new funds to scale up its operations and launch new features. The company said it recently reached 3 million registered users and is experiencing revenue growth, without providing specific figures. It also claims that over 100 Kumu livestreamers now earn at least 20,000 pesos (or nearly US$400) each month from streaming original content on its platform. 
 “As the rise of global interactive platforms such as Tik Tok and livestreaming apps gain acceptance with the younger generation, there remains a significant gap for local content and hyperlocal networks,” said Openspace co-founder and partner Hian Goh, adding that Kumu is serving a population of 103 million young and internet-savvy Filipinos. 
 As for the new features, Kumu said it will be rolling out an AI- and community-driven live commerce platform. This will allow fans to purchase products while watching livestreamers, giving content creators more opportunities to earn from their streams, according to a statement. 
 “Our livestream ecommerce pilot generated almost 300 product purchases in a 10-minute period,” said Kumu co-founder Roland Ros. “The more we empower our creators to drive the digital influence of ecommerce in the Philippines, the more we empower consumers, fintech players, and logistics companies to participate in the digital marketplace of our motherland.” 
 With the backing of ABS-CBN, one of the major TV networks in the Philippines, Kumu may also see wider reach. 
 “With this app [Kumu], we envision a new era for our shows, game shows, and ABS-CBN talents, wherein fresh ideas and live interaction can serve our audience best,” ABS-CBN’s head of business development, Luis Paolo M. Pineda, said.

644595,Honestbee founder’s biggest lie in a web of deceit," Brian Koo, a scion of the family that controls South Korean electronics giant LG, has been looking to make a name for himself. 
 In 2013, he was running Silicon Valley venture capital firm Formation 8, and he began eyeing opportunities in Asia. It was around that time that he met Joel Sng, and they hit it off. 
 Sng seemed like a kindred spirit and a perfect business partner for Koo. They shared a vision for what would become Honestbee, an on-demand concierge for groceries and food. 
 
  Joel Sng (left) and Brian Koo 
 
 But more than that, Sng’s resume was out of this world, suggesting he had ingratiated himself with the business and political elite. After graduating from Harvard University in 2008, he supposedly made investments in the who’s who of the tech world: Razer, Xiaomi, Airbnb, Uber, and Facebook among others. 
 Sng claimed that he had seats on various boards and advisory panels at organizations linked to the Singapore government, including the Prime Minister’s Office. 
 Two of Honestbee’s early investors are prominent figures in the city-state’s business community. There’s private equity investor Chee Cheong Gay and Melissa Kwee, whose family owns Pontiac Land Group, a real estate developer and hotel operator. 
 A $10 ruse? 
 How did Sng amass these credentials so quickly? He was good at charming potential partners and tapping into their motivations to get what he wants, multiple associates tell  Tech in Asia.  
 While his early life remained fodder for gossip, Sng’s achievements centered around a preposterous claim: that he was the great-grandson of Chinese revolutionary leader  Sun Yat-sen . 
 It turned out to be a lie sold well. “Yes, he told me,” says Brian Koo in an exclusive interview with  Tech in Asia . He adds that Sng, whose surname is the Hokkien equivalent of “Sun,” didn’t want that claim published in the media “for some reason.” 
 “I thought it was a sensitivity issue,” Koo says. He could sympathize because, coming from a prominent family himself, he dislikes how the media highlights his background over his own story. 
 Sng maintained that false veneer over many years. He once attended a dinner where someone would talk up his supposed lineage on his behalf. “Sng would nod sagely” without confirming nor denying it, a person present at the gathering tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Ming Shen Cheo, founder of Singapore startup Nuffnang, recalls a prominent industry figure introducing Sng, who went by “Joel Sun” some years ago, as someone who’s related to Sun Yat-sen. 
 “He approached Nuffnang as a tech investor of some repute,” he says, “I received that name card and was told stories about how he was a descendant of Sun Yat-sen who liked to remain low-key.” 
 
  Joel Sng’s name card for Sun Group Capital 
 
 The lie formed a larger web of deceit that Sng had meticulously spun, recalling what fugitive  Jho Low  – the businessman behind the 1MDB scandal – did when he reportedly claimed to be from Malaysian nobility. 
 Perhaps to shore up his deception, Sng created Sun Group Capital, a “family-owned” holding company that was supposed to have tech and real estate assets in the US, China, and Southeast Asia,  according to  Forbes  . 
 In reality, the company was only incorporated in 2011, had Sng as the sole director, and owned S$10 in paid-up capital, its public filings show. 
 Ticking time bomb 
 The ruse worked. Sng became rich and famous, but he left a broad swath of destruction in his wake. By 2020, Honestbee was stuck with US$230 million in debt. Much of it was owed to Koo and various investors, with the remaining to small and vulnerable suppliers. 
 That sum, however, doesn’t cover money owed to people outside of Singapore, an Honestbee spokesperson told  Tech in Asia . These people include employees as well as food sellers eking out a living at wet markets. 
 Sng’s facade of wealth quelled any doubt. 
 Meanwhile, thousands of workers – both full-time and contractual – devoted months if not years of their lives to the company, only to find out that it was set up to fail from the beginning. 
 How did Honestbee end up in that state? Sng, who was the CEO and a co-founder of Honestbee, was given free rein to run the business while Koo limited his role. “I was involved in building the thesis and mainly raising capital. I was not invited to any board meeting as I was not a director,” Koo recalls. 
 As the startup grew, so did Sng’s pack of lies. He bought a house in Japan, rented apartments in various cities, and then spent millions renovating and furnishing Honestbee – all using the company’s money. 
  See:  Honestbee starts legal action against ex-CEO and ex-director    
 While employees might have protested the spending as too extravagant for a startup, Sng’s facade of wealth quelled any doubt. 
 The team was “under the impression that the money was Joel’s,” an ex-staff tells  Tech in Asia .

 However, as the spotlight shone on Honestbee, Sng’s illusion began to unravel, starting with his claim of being Sun Yat-sen’s great-grandson. 
 While Sng wanted his bluff to be low-key, it soon got out of hand. Formation 8, the investment firm that he was a part of, was likely unaware of the lie and wanted to trumpet the information. After all, flaunting your connections is good for business. 
  Bloomberg  published the lineage claim in 2015, and  Tech in Asia  echoed it. This caught the attention of the actual descendants, who demanded a correction from the media. 
 Sng had to do damage control. He asked  Tech in Asia  to remove any reference to Sun Yat-sen. “I think the genesis of this is some random blog which got picked up by  Bloomberg ” without fact-checking, he wrote in an email to us. 
  See:  Honestbee: The inside story of what went wrong and what’s next   
 Koo got wind of this ploy as well. “I was shocked later when I heard the [denial] from the actual Sun Yat-sen family,” he explains, though he didn’t say when he found out about it. 
 Sng succeeded in sweeping it under the rug. Honestbee – and Sng’s profligate spending – chugged on as if nothing happened. 
 Cracks start to show 
 But over the years, the relationship between Sng and Koo began to fray. 
 In 2018, they had to deal with early investors who threatened legal action over alleged unfair treatment. Koo says it’s a spat that he’s still trying to resolve today, adding that the investors are rightly confused and concerned because of how Honestbee had communicated to them in the past. 
 He was starting to wonder about Honestbee’s strategy. Sng, for example, wanted to build its logistics business from scratch in many countries. 
 Koo thought it was a waste of resources. “The amount of capital needed was going up fast and that was a sign of trouble,” he says, adding that he preferred working with existing logistics players in each locality instead. 
 
  Honestbee’s extravagant office 
 
 Making things worse was how Koo jetted from meeting to meeting to persuade investors while Sng “simply would not raise any capital for the company.” 
 Koo even took on debt to keep his business interests going. “I did make some wrong decisions for my personal life and my family that I do regret,” he admits, saying that he did it all to help the companies he invested in. 
 It was a “tough time for me, for sure. I am dealing with it in the best way I can,” he shares. 
  See:  The Honestbee ex-chairman’s lonely fight to keep his dream alive   
 Meanwhile, Sng was living it up. He spent hundreds of thousands in US dollars on “entertainment” expenses, business class flights, and five-star hotels even as his subordinates bootstrapped, according to former employees. 
 Sources tell  Tech in Asia  that  Sng was rarely involved  when Honestbee’s team pitched to investors to raise US$150 million. 
 “Such a massive round, and the founder didn’t want to make the trip down – it’s a sign of disrespect,” says an investor who declined to be named. 
 Koo demanded an explanation from Sng, who deflected by saying that he thought fundraising was not his responsibility. Koo disagreed. 
 “I told him that 90% – and sometimes 100% – of the CEO’s work is fundraising for the company. He would tell me that he could only raise a huge amount from big players, but we just need to get closer to the size or status they want,” he says. The rebuttal fell on deaf ears – Sng would ask for more money. 
 Later on, Koo realized that the updates that Sng had been giving him about the company was not in line with reality. 
 He found out that Honestbee’s culture had become “anti-entrepreneurship”: Employees couldn’t speak up against Sng, co-founders and key personnel were not given equity, and the CEO claimed credit for work that he had no part of. 
 But the biggest issue was that the numbers Sng gave him were different from the actual ones.

 While Koo paints himself as a victim, he confesses that in hindsight, there were things he could have done differently. “I would’ve done more visits and meetings in person with the company’s customers and partners instead of getting more reports and updates.” 
 “I definitely learned the importance of having the right partner and entrepreneur,” he adds, “I would’ve spent more time on learning about the person before jumping into a business.” 
 In April 2019, Koo decided he’d had enough and fired Sng. After this was leaked to  TechCrunch , Sng derided it as “fake news” and then packed his belongings. 
 Sng also tried and failed to get Koo to sign an agreement that would release him of any liability for his actions as the CEO and board member of Honestbee. 
 Catch me if you can 
 Today, Koo is trying to pick up the pieces on the business front. Recent events have caused “significant damage” to his personal life while serving as a “wake-up call,” he says. He also realized that focusing on a company’s valuation and funding at the expense of business fundamentals had been the wrong approach. 
 Meanwhile, Honestbee has initiated legal action against Sng for the  millions in US dollars  that he has allegedly siphoned and then tried to cover up. 
 But the move may hit a roadblock as one of Honestbee’s creditors, Benjamin Lim, has filed a court application to wind up the company. Lim had earlier settled with Sng after suing him to recover lost money. It’s unclear why Lim would want to liquidate Honestbee as he would only incur more legal fees from doing so. 
 All I want is justice. 
 Honestbee’s investigation into Sng may, however, weigh on the court’s decision to liquidate the firm. 
 As Lawrence Loh, director of National University of Singapore’s Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations, told  The Straits Times : “There are potentially more claims and investigations to come, and if there is enough justification for so, the authorities could step in and conduct their investigations on the company and its directors as well.” 
 Koo declined to comment on his involvement in the legal action. 
 “All I want is justice,” he stresses, so the “people that did wrong things should face the proper outcome.” ",Terence Lee,8,8,"[(0, 0.9277533), (3, 0.07220351)]","['Facebook', 'Forbes', 'LG']","['Airbnb', 'US', 'Singapore', 'Nuffnang', 'Hokkien', 'Asia', 'Uber', 'Xiaomi', 'Japan', 'China', 'Tech']"
644496,Seoul-based energy funding startup bags $5.1m in Hyundai-led round," Energy development, or the process of sourcing energy from natural resources, is a complicated but profitable industry. But with various parties involved, the market continues to use opaque practices, which raises concerns for investors and independent power producers (IPPs). 
 To make processes more transparent and simpler, South Korea-based  Energy X  has developed an AI-driven platform that allows corporate and individual users to invest in renewable energy projects worldwide.

 Energy X said it recently raised US$5.1 million in series A money to further build out what it calls a “social energy platform.” The funding round was led by Hyundai Venture Investment and included participation from Simbon Investment Partners and Ophir Equity Partners. 
 The startup’s total funding is now US$13.2 million, including the funds raised by its fintech subsidiary Energy X Square, according to a statement. 
 Energy X’s online-to-offline platform lets investors find crowdfunding, private funding, and exchange opportunities to profit from low- to mid-risk renewable energy projects. In turn, this allows IPPs, which are traditionally mid- and large-sized companies, to have better access to investors and contractors and start projects more easily. 
 Sean Park, Energy X’s CEO, also said that the solution allows users to find and examine an adequate land site, select the right brands of devices, and enter into an agreement with a contractor and investors all online. 
 “With the social energy platform, the company hopes to allow every household individual to own his or her energy plant at the backyard or rooftop, etc.,” Park told  Tech in Asia . “The company’s platform strives to make energy not only socially responsible, but socially owned, operated, and profited.” 
 The company also provides device sales agencies as well as contractors for engineering, procurement, construction, operation, and maintenance. 
 According to Park, energy development’s reliability and profitability make it a good investment product, but the market is currently saturated by loans from high-yield fund managers with costly fees. 
 “These returns are shared by the fund managers and banks before they make it to the real end-investors – the individuals who subscribed to those funds and bank accounts,” he said. 
 “Without the fund managers and banks as the medium, individuals select their own projects to invest in, and no longer are small-sized projects looked over. This way, the company hopes to expand the financing market for small-sized energy projects,” Park added. 
 Park, who was formerly a VC, founded Energy X in 2019 with ex-Samsung AI programmer Tom Hong. The chief exec said that the company’s ultimate goal is to deliver a greener world by replacing old energy with clean and renewable alternatives.

 On the equity side, KoinWorks said it hit the first close of its convertible note, which received backing from existing investors Quona Capital, EV Growth, and Saison Capital, among others. 
 It also secured new credit facilities to underwrite loans via its lending platform. One of the new facilities was provided by Triodos Bank, a global financial institution based in the Netherlands. 
 “As an institution with the protection of our lenders’ capital at our core, being well capitalized is always a top priority,” said KoinWorks co-founder and executive chairman Willy Arifin. The exec added that the company continues to work with financial institutions and retail lenders to support digital small- and medium-sized enterprises during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 The company said that to maintain quality in its loan book amid the outbreak, it has been actively applying more processes that combine digital data with traditional banking techniques. 
 KoinWorks is also part of East Venture-led initiative  Indonesia Pasti Bisa , a fundraising activity that aims to support the production of 100,000 Covid-19 test kits and genetic research for a potential vaccine. 
 Founded in 2016, the company connects SMEs to investors through its peer-to-peer lending platform. 
 In September 2019, KoinWorks co-founder and CEO Benedicto Haryono told  Tech in Asia  that the company was  close to profitability , hitting about US$14 million in disbursements per month at that time. 
 Earlier that year, the startup bagged  US$12 million  in a series B round led by Quona Capital and EV Growth. It was followed up by Japan’s Credit Saison in November 2019, pouring in  US$1.4 million  as part of the same round.

644435,How MLOps helps businesses realize machine learning’s full potential," Machine learning has the potential to  reshape the world in many areas , changing the way we use and understand data. 
 For instance, healthcare companies are tapping into machine learning technologies to deliver faster, more accurate diagnoses for everything from cancer to Covid-19, while security companies are using various algorithms to train surveillance systems to recognize threats. 
 In 2019, data science topped the list of  LinkedIn’s emerging job rankings , with hiring growth in the industry at 74%. 
 However, even for businesses with expert teams,  less than half of data science projects  end up being fully deployed. 
 For all the benefits that machine learning can afford companies, actually taking it to the last mile and using it effectively is surprisingly difficult. 
 The challenges of machine learning 
 Production machine learning, or production ML, is the process of putting machine learning into practice and benefiting from it. However, a whole array of problems arise when it comes to implementation. 
 Issues often arise in the areas of  data management ,  data life cycles , and the deployment and management of machine learning models. 
 Data scientists, for instance, have difficulty implementing these models into production environments, as that is not the main focus of their work, while operations staff are often unsure of how to best integrate machine learning models into their existing systems. 
 To maximize the advantages of machine learning, it’s necessary for businesses to unify the different people involved in production ML, such as data scientists, IT engineers, developers, and the operations team, and establish a streamlined process across their respective domains. 
 This is where MLOps comes in. 
 What is MLOps? 
 Machine learning operations, or MLOps, provides a way for companies to deploy and manage machine learning models more effectively. 
 This was the reason why enterprise AI platform  DataRobot  acquired ParallelM – a MLOps software company – in 2019. 
 ParallelM co-founder and CEO Sivan Metzger, who is now the managing director of MLOps at DataRobot, was inspired by his own experience of working with data science teams at his previous job in the advertising technology industry.

 “In earlier companies I worked at, we had a team of data scientists, and they were doing wonderful work, but none of their work was seeing the light of day because collaboration between them and the operations team was unattainable,” Metzger shares. 
 Think of MLOps as  DevOps  for machine learning models. It combines the disparate processes involved in deploying machine learning systems by merging development and operations into one seamless unit. 
 “MLOps connects the relevant data together with the models and runs and manages them in the live environment where predictions need to be made, feeding into the relevant business processes,” explains Metzger. 
 The importance of MLOps 
 Machine learning models are different from regular software applications, which means typical parameters used to test the effectiveness of a program are no longer applicable. 
 For example, machine learning systems are very sensitive to data and have difficulty in navigating production situations where context is shifting, says Metzger. 
 Unlike software, where it’s easy to check if it’s doing what it’s supposed to do, there are no real guidelines to analyze if machine learning models are generating the right predictions, thanks to the probabilistic nature of machine learning. 
 With MLOps, developers can monitor and upgrade the models while they are running in production, without interrupting services to business operations, much like how software updates are barely a blip on our radars. 
 But as machine learning becomes more prevalent, regulatory guidelines surrounding its use are getting stricter, which is a problem for operations teams as well. 
 To solve this, MLOps also includes the notion of “production model governance,” allowing companies to limit, manage, and track who can make changes to a machine learning model. 
 These changes are then logged, and the operations team can examine them to see if they align with regulations, querying the reasons behind the adjustments if necessary. 
 Data scientists, on the other hand, can focus on getting models working accurately, without having to worry too much about meeting requirements or fixing deployment issues. 
 How businesses benefit 
 According to Metzger, all companies stand to gain from using MLOps. Data is the new oil, and many businesses need to tap on the affordances of machine learning to progress and remain competitive. It is vital to use the right strategies and technology in implementing machine learning.

 MLOps allows these entities to divide the roles in all aspects of production ML more clearly, says Metzger. It also “tightens and closes the loop” when it comes to the collaboration between the different teams inherently involved.. 
 For instance, instead of having complicated back-and-forths between the data scientists and operations staff, where people have their own approach towards the work and use different software and programs, everything can be done through a centralized MLOps platform. 
 One company that has benefited from such practices is Wisely, an AI-powered fundraising service. ParallelM worked with Wisely prior to its acquisition by DataRobot, and helped integrate MLOps into its development process. 
 In doing so, Wisely was able to  deploy and optimize  the algorithms used to scale its fundraising productivity tool, without requiring any additional resources. 
 The future of MLOps 
 As  the data science industry  focuses on scalability, greater collaboration, and the need for machine learning models to be production-ready, MLOps is becoming a vital tool and process. 
 And as machine learning becomes more prevalent across various industries, companies need to begin laying down the foundations of the technology, getting non-data scientists involved in the process right from the get-go. 
 If businesses want to fully capitalize on the potential of machine learning, they must also begin from the ground-up. 
 “You don’t build a house in a day. You first build the foundation, and a strong MLOps strategy is the foundation required for machine learning initiatives to ultimately become successful,” says Metzger. 
 
 DataRobot is an enterprise AI platform that aims to democratize data science with end-to-end automation for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models. 
 Its new  MLOps offering  provides a centralized hub for deployment, monitoring, management and governance of machine learning models created from a variety of tools.

644419,Social commerce is gaining momentum in Indonesia," Despite a  slowdown in fundraising across Asia , venture capital firms are betting on Indonesia’s emerging social commerce platforms. 
 For the past four months, the industry has become one of the top-funded verticals in the country, after transportation, education, fintech, and ecommerce, according to  Tech in Asia  data. 
   
  An offshoot of ecommerce, social commerce startups build a network of offline agents that promote and sell products to people in their communities. The business model was started in China by platforms like   Pinduoduo   and is just beginning to take off in Indonesia.  
  The sector is also seeing strong demand amid the Covid-19 pandemic as most stay at home and buy their daily necessities online.

  According to Erika Dianasari, a partner at Alpha JWC Ventures, social commerce startups are addressing a need that traditional ecommerce sites like Tokopedia, Shopee, and Lazada have yet to fulfill.   
  “Ecommerce penetration in Indonesia is still low,” says Dianasari. “That’s why the opportunity for social commerce is very big.” A recent Goldman Sachs report supports this statement, revealing that ecommerce penetration for physical goods is only 7% of the total retail market in the country.  
  Today, Alpha JWC Ventures has three social commerce startups under its belt. One has been working in the industry since the beginning, while the other two had different business models before switching into the space.

  In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia, social commerce startups have reported a spike in demand, especially for groceries and health-related goods such as face masks and antiseptic. Woobiz, which focuses on fashion, daily necessities, and mom and baby items, claims that its daily transactions have spiked fourfold.  
  “Products like supplements and sanitary care increased 5x compared to last month,” says Putri Noor Shaqina, the co-founder of Woobiz.  
  As the outbreak continues to spread, people in the informal sector have found themselves out of a job which may work to the advantage of the industry as well.   
  “Acquiring agents through online channels is cheaper now because the conversion rate has increased. People are likely to adopt our platform to earn additional income,” says Jake Goh, the CEO of membership-based social commerce platform RateS.  
  Despite the popularity of the business model and the good momentum it’s gotten so far, startups in the space are still in their early stages. Most of these players only have a few thousands of agents and limited penetration compared to ecommerce firms, which typically have millions of users.   
  The total addressable market of the sector could reach US$200 billion, says Steven Wongsoredjo, the CEO of social commerce firm Super, which is backed by hip hop artist Jay-Z’s VC firm.  
 Focus on specific products 
  To achieve significant growth – particularly against traditional ecommerce players – social commerce companies need to offer the right kinds of products.   
  Super, for example, focuses on the FMCG space, which is a high-volume business with low value per transaction. According to the CEO, this move can enable the company to process a large number of transactions in the beginning.  
  “We can optimize the profit after by cross-selling products that have a better margin,” says Wongsoredjo.

  Another social commerce startup, Chilibeli, sells fresh produce like vegetables and fruits, which are quite tricky to handle logistically. These goods are also sold in high volumes, as 20% of Indonesia’s household expenditure goes into groceries, according to representatives from the company.  
  Other players center on items like fashion and personal care necessities from big retailers, which often offer better margins, or sell merchandise from small businesses that have more unique products.  
  With the massive size of the Indonesian market, Wongsoredjo predicts that there will ultimately be three to four types of social commerce firms that tackle different kinds of products, geographies, and users.

  For players in the industry, Indonesia’s vastly social population is a huge advantage, and it’s a characteristic that may be even more prominent in rural areas, says Wongsoredjo, who claims that Super is the market leader in these localities in terms of number of agents and sales.  
  “If you go down to villages, you will see these people are often involved in so many organizations like    arisan    (social gatherings that revolve around finances), PKK (family welfare programs), and others. Digital literacy is not mature, and people have less trust to buy things online,” he says.  
  The popularity of multilevel marketing businesses and pyramid selling is another aspect that points to the viability of the social selling model in the country, says Dianasari.   
  Social commerce startups operate almost the same way as these schemes but with only one layer of agents. Popular payments apps like Kudo and Payfazz also use an agent-based model.  
 A hybrid model 
  Most social commerce startups in the country use a reseller model, where end buyers can purchase products through agents. However, other companies like Super are trying a hybrid approach by pooling orders first before running transactions for some items.   
  “Part of [Super’s] supply chain development is building small hubs in villages so agents can pick up products to sell to their communities,” Wongsoredjo says. “We also have group buying with a minimum order to make sure we have the average order value that makes us profitable in every transaction.”

  While Indonesia’s players aim to be like the social commerce firms in China such as Pinduoduo and Shihuituan, Dianasari says an exact copy of these companies may not happen in the country. For one, the infrastructure in Indonesia is not as advanced as China’s – the country doesn’t have chat apps like WeChat that can reach a massive audience while facilitating transactions at the same time – she says. Logistics and penetration to the end consumer is also a challenge.  
  However, Dianasari is optimistic about the growth of the business.  
  “Several years ago, we may not have predicted that e-wallets like GoPay can be used in food stalls, [but that is what happens today],” she says.

 Many authorized Huawei retailers in three Chinese cities – Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuxi – have already launched on Meituan’s delivery platforms as of Friday. Customers can purchase the latest Huawei P40 smartphone on Meituan’s mobile app and have it delivered to their doorstep within an hour, according to Meituan. 
 When  KrAsia  checked the nearest authorized Huawei retailer on Meituan’s mobile app, it appears that the nearest store can fulfill deliveries at a starting price of 45 yuan (US$6.40) and charge 5 yuan as the delivery fee. The pricing of products listed on Meituan’s app is identical to the flagship store on JD.com. 
 Meituan can also deliver beauty products from French cosmetics retailer Sephora, available in 16 cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. The company said it also supports deliveries of clothes and face masks on the platform. 
 This is not the first time that Meituan has expanded its delivery service. In March, the company closed a deal with the Beijing municipal government to have 72 bookstores in the city sell their products on the app. The food delivery giant has waived admission fees and reduced service fees to lessen the burden for bookstores affected by the coronavirus pandemic. 
 Delivery services for these new products are provided by Meituan Instashopping, which was set up as an independent business with an aim to provide consumers with on-demand non-food delivery within 30 minutes, according to Meituan. 
 Meituan aims to increase order volumes on its delivery platform by introducing new types of products, as the company’s business was heavily impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Meituan expects negative year-over-year revenue growth and an operating loss for the first quarter of 2020, as the food delivery business faces significant challenges on the demand side and supply side, the company said in its latest financial report. 
 Meituan’s move has put itself into more direct competition with ecommerce giants such as JD.com and Alibaba’s Taobao and T-mall,  36Kr  reported, adding that local courier companies who are fulfilling deliveries for those ecommerce platforms, such as SF Express and STO Express, will also face increased competition.

 The investment, which was led by Korea’s KB Investment, pushes the company’s total capital raised to over S$6.6 million (US$4.7 million), according to a statement. Participating investors include existing backer SGInnovate and US-based VC Greycroft Partners through the GC VR Gaming Tracker Fund, which is focused on VR, augmented reality, video games, and e-sports. 
 Mighty Jaxx plans to funnel the new funds into the development of its proprietary technology platform called MightyVerse, which it first started to build after securing its  first tranche  of funding last year. 
 With the platform, Mighty Jaxx aims to leverage Singapore’s GovTech OpenCert program to allow it to issue permanent and tamper-resistant certificates to each of its collectibles. The tech-enabled collectibles have been rolled out in phases since the start of the year, said the startup. It’s targeting to ship out 5 million units for 2020. 
 The company will also use part of the funds to ramp up production for the second half of the year, as it recently onboarded entertainment giants Hasbro and Nickelodeon on new global licensing deals. 
 
 Since its launch in 2012, Mighty Jaxx has produced collectibles under partnerships with global brands such as Cartoon Network, Warner Brothers, DC Comics, Looney Tunes, and Sesame Street, among others. 
 In July 2019, it raised nearly US$1.6 million in the first close of its pre-series A round. It was led by local startup growth platform Eight Mercatus, with SGInnovate following on.

644458,Sony buys $400m stake in China’s Bilibili," After a series of previous projects together, Sony has secured a 4.98% stake in Bilibili after investing US$400 million in cash, a deal which will also see the two companies further collaborate on anime and mobile games, according to a press release by the Nasdaq-listed social platform.

 Buoyed by the announcement, shares of Bilibili surged more than 12% to US$29.55 before starting to pull back. Its stock closed at US$26.83 per share. Sony Corporation of America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation, has purchased 17.3 million newly issued Class Z ordinary shares of Bilibili at a price of US$23.10 per share, equivalent to US$23.10 per American depository share. The deal was closed according to Bilibili’s latest SEC filing. 
 “The strategic investment and business cooperation further align our goals to bring best-in-class content offerings and services to our users, as we increase our domestic stronghold in animation and mobile games,” said Rui Chen, chairman of the board and CEO of Bilibili, in the company’s statement. 
 “We look forward to joining efforts on a broader scale to fulfill the tremendous and growing entertainment needs in China,” he added. 
 Bilibili is currently valued at around US$8.8 billion and has become a rising star for institutional investors in China. In a move highly unique among large platforms in China, the company secured backing from both Tencent and Alibaba, the two biggest competitors in the country’s internet industry, with 13.3% and 7.2% stakes, respectively. 
 Sony’s participation doesn’t come as a total surprise, as the duo has previously teamed up on a slew of projects. 
 On April 8, Bilibili announced a strategic partnership with Sony to provide its users copyrighted music videos from the label, which has artists such as Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Bob Dylan, Oasis, and Britney Spears under its portfolio,  KrAsia  reported. 
 Earlier in 2019, Bilibili and Sony-owned American entertainment company Funimation inked a strategic partnership during that year’s AnimeJapan to acquire anime licenses. 
 Back in 2012, when Bilibili first officially introduced licensed anime to its site, their first work,  Fate/Zero , was published by Sony’s subsidiary, Aniplex. In 2016, Bilibili became the exclusive Chinese agent of Aniplex’s mobile game,  Fate/Grand Order , which generated half of Bilibili’s revenue in 2017. 
 Bilibili saw its revenues jump by 74% year on year to US$288.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, with a widening net loss of 387.2 million yuan (US$55.6 million) compared to 190.8 million yuan (US$27.1 million) in the same period of 2018,  KrAsia  reported. 
 The youth-oriented platform claimed to have 130.3 million average monthly active users and 37.9 million daily average users, up 40% and 41%, respectively, year on year.

644325,The stress (and mindfuck) curve 📈," Dear Readers, 
 I recently had a good call with a fellow founder. We talked about how our businesses are doing, discussed the changes we’ve made, and traded notes on how we’re dealing with pressure. 
 It turned out that we both feel grateful to be alive during these trying times. The business environment today is grim, but if you’re up for a challenge, then this is the time to buckle down and shine. 
 We’re also both meditating more often as it calms our souls. While there are a lot of uncertainties, we believe there isn’t a point to worry, especially when a lot of things are not within our control. 
 But that’s easier said than done. 
 The mental pendulum 
 Fortunately,  Tech in Asia  had a pretty decent March. (Note: For longtime lurkers reading my commentary, you can subscribe and support us  at a very attractive rate here .) 
 But what’s gonna happen in April and the rest of 2020 and 2021? It’s truly a black box. 
 So my team and I can’t help but to think ahead and have Plan B, C, D, E, F, and G as we navigate the landmines. 
 I’m not zen like a Buddisht monk, and I admit that I find this whole Covid-19 situation quite a mindfuck. But really, let’s all calm down as there’s little point to worry too much about things that are out of our hands. 
 So that’s me, swinging between the “comfort” and “strain” zones like a pendulum. But overall, I feel great when I achieve optimal performance.

 By sharing this openly, hopefully you’ll know that you’re not alone. 🤗 
 I think it’s only human to be mentally bouncing back and forth in times of great uncertainty. Just avoid getting burned out and try as much as you can to enjoy the ride. 
 Here are some things I do which hopefully can help you find some equilibrium as we operate under tremendous stress. If you have any tips, please let me know all about it. 
 
 Talk to people. Share your fuck-ups and struggles. You’ll feel better and you may even find solutions as you discuss them. 
 If you have kids, focus on them. Try explaining Covid-19 to a two-year-old child, you’ll probably get hilarious responses. Children are the happiest when schools go on lockdown, so tap into their positivity. 
 Exercise. Do it at home or outside, if your city isn’t on a full lockdown. I can no longer play tennis as they closed the courts, so I have to find other alternatives. 
 Meditate. I’m not a pro, but committing 10 minutes daily to meditation makes me feel a lot calmer. 
 Do random silly things during conference calls. Everyone needs some lighthearted fun. 
 
 Stay optimistic! 💪

644394,Vietnamese startup that co-invests in homes secures funds for regional expansion," Southeast Asia remains to be one of the fastest-growing real estate markets in the world. But with rapidly increasing prices, a high appetite for home ownership, and a lack of financing options, the home ownership crisis in the region stays real. In Ho Chi Minh City, for example, apartment prices have increased 22.7% year on year in 2019, according to Vietnamese proptech startup Homebase.

  Homebase  said it has raised an undisclosed amount of pre-seed funding from early-stage venture capital firm and startup generator Antler, Iterative VC, several strategic angel investors, and Brian Ma, co-founder of US-based alternative home ownership startup Divvy Homes. 
 Homebase is one of the 14 startups from  Antler’s third cohort . 
 The startup provides customized co-investment plans, where home buyers could pay the portion they can afford, move in from the first day, and then buy out all or part of their stake when they are ready. 
 Homebase first covers the remaining amount and ask for a rental fee for the portion it paid. Several years later, it will take a portion of the capital appreciation if the home appreciates in value. It doesn’t charge recurring interest or other fees. 
 The company said it uses big data, asset valuation models, and financial engineering to make investment decisions. 
 Homebase plans to use the new funds to expand its tech infrastructure, make new hires, and push forward with its regional expansion plans, according to a statement. 
 “We see an opportunity to develop a new home ownership journey that works for those of us who want flexibility and assurance as we work towards owning our dream homes,” said JunYuan Tan, co-founder and CEO of Homebase. 
 Tan built the startup with co-founders Phillip An, Hung Viet Doan, and Hai Vu in 2019. According to the statement, the Homebase team comprises of real estate investors, veteran computer scientists, and serial entrepreneurs hailing from institutions such as Harvard, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, Microsoft, and Cisco.

644382,Pushing the tech envelope to nurture ecommerce for a post-Covid-19 world," The global spread of Covid-19 is changing the world into one that is increasingly reliant on technology. More people are staying indoors and working from home to help curb the pandemic, and this has accelerated the digital economy, especially in Southeast Asia, which is expected to be the  fourth-largest economy in the world by 2030 . 
 The region’s flourishing digital economy reached a gross merchandise value (GMV) of  US$100 billion in 2019 and is projected to hit the US$300 billion mark by 2025 , according to a report by Google, Bain &amp; Company, and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings. 
 The study also found that the biggest driver of this progress has been the ecommerce industry, which grew over seven times from a GMV value of US$5.5 billion in 2015 to US$38 billion in 2019. The sector is on track to exceed US$150 billion in GMV by 2025. 
 Technology is fueling a chunk of its growth, with factors such as  improved internet penetration and mobile connectivity  underpinning enhanced, personalized, and seamless shopping experiences online. With more people tapping into ecommerce to meet their daily needs, it’s critical to see how the industry prepares everyone for a post-Covid-19 world. 
 By leveraging technology to build and enable an ecosystem that includes payments and logistics, ecommerce players like  Lazada  have helped in accelerating progress for the digital economy. 
 “We look at what we need to do today to capture opportunities in the region five to 10 years down the line. That’s why we are building the world’s most scalable technologies for ecommerce, backed by Alibaba’s ecosystem,” says Carlos Barrera, Lazada Philippines’ chief operating officer. “We are building and expanding our logistics network and payment infrastructure to meet consumers’ demands and help our sellers do the same so they can do business easily anywhere.”

 “At this point, ecommerce penetration is at 3% to 5% of the retail sector in Southeast Asia, compared with China’s 20%. Just imagine the immense potential that is yet untapped.” 
 The Southeast Asia ecommerce story 
 Ecommerce in the region has evolved from its early days. In the 2010s, the nascent industry faced many hurdles such as low internet penetration, a significant unbanked population, and fragmented logistics services. This was especially true in markets with large rural populations, such as Indonesia and the Philippines. 
 Some of these challenges still remain today, but to a lesser degree. Recognizing this from the beginning, Lazada introduced solutions such as cash-on-delivery payment options and building its own logistics network. 
 As the number of internet users in the region  ballooned from 260 million in 2015 to 360 million in 2019 , and become  more digitally engaged , Lazada was able to drive more innovation, such as introducing the e-wallet option on its platform and building more interactive features to engage its consumers. 
 Beyond transactions 
 Since  integrating with Alibaba , Lazada has capitalized on the Chinese giant’s technology resources to transform shopping from a transactional experience to a social one, including pioneering  the concept of “shoppertainment”  and bringing mega shopping festivals such as 11.11 and 12.12 to Southeast Asia. 
 “Shoppertainment and shopping festivals have changed the way ecommerce platforms, brands, and sellers engage with and interact with consumers – from merely a click-and-buy experience to one that’s more about watching, playing, and shopping,” says Barrera. “It’s also an opportunity for brands and businesses, especially small and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to reach and acquire more customers, build brand awareness and loyalty, and boost sales and grow.” 
 Shoppertainment uses technology such as augmented reality that lets people try on a shade of lipstick or a dress, interactive content via livestreaming that allows sellers to promote their wares, and gamification of in-app features that converts users’ winnings into vouchers and discounts. 
 Lazada’s 11.11 sale last year was the first to include its gaming arcade. Launched in March 2019.  LazGame  allows shoppers to play on the app to earn discounts. 
 The event also featured interactive livestream content such as gameshows. “Over 1.1 million viewers across the region tuned in during the four-hour Guess It! session, making it one of the most watched in-app livestreams,” says Barrera, referring to one of the programs. 
 These features were built in-house, with Lazada developers working closely with their Alibaba counterparts. 
 This social approach also comes with tailored recommendations and chatbot support services as well as greater localization and personalization of the shopping experience, powered by Alibaba’s technology.

 Supporting the sellers 
 Lazada has a suite of technology tools designed to improve the selling experience for online merchants. For instance, the data portal it offers via its grocery arm  Redmart  helps sellers make informed business decisions. 
 “We can assess which product categories are performing well and which aren’t, as well as which promotion activities are doing well, so that we can tweak it accordingly,” says Alan Siek, co-founder of  Prestigio Delights , a company that sells niche and novelty food products on Redmart and Lazada. No personal information of customers is available on these portals. 
 “It’s a kind of data analysis, and they also share best practices,” he observes. “This helps us achieve consistent sales increments.” 
 Having used the livestream feature as a seller, Siek lauds the end-to-end nature of Lazada’s solution. “We just need to book a timeslot and provide information such as a storyboard and digital assets that we will use, such as banners and feeds,” he says. His company was able to achieve five-figure sales during the two-hour long livestream – an impressive achievement, considering Prestigio deals in small-ticket items. 
 With a majority of its sellers using mobile to manage their business, Lazada optimizes its seller app to make it easy for them to work from anywhere, including proactively sending messages to engage with buyers. 
 “Ecommerce and the digital economy empower Southeast Asia’s SMEs and enable them to scale,” says Barrera. “And shopping festivals such as 11.11 offer them opportunities to reach markets they never would have if they only sold offline.” 
 What lies in store 
 Moving forward, Lazada sees continued engagement with consumers and empowerment of sellers as key to ecommerce’s future in the region. 
 “It’s important to drive brand engagement and provide touchpoints for customers both online and offline,” explains Barrera. “It’s also about redefining the in-app experience, creating the same offline social atmosphere you get with friends and family within an online context.” 
 To this end, the company is looking to use AI to further streamline and personalize the shopping experience, among other options. This also enhances the ecosystem by creating more jobs, such as algorithm engineers for content and promotion, and AI trainers to improve the chatbot experience. 
 Going back to the basics, it’s also about supporting sellers, especially local SMEs, so they can scale domestically and sell internationally. During this period, ecommerce has become a lifeline for many offline sellers looking to continue their business. 
 “Innovation and an entrepreneurial spirit have always been a part of Lazada’s DNA,” says Barrera. “We have spent the last decade building this, and we will continue to do so for the next.”

 The firm said that “certain employee wrongdoing was discovered,” adding that the employee conspired with external vendors to inflate sales of the company’s newly introduced business, called Light Class, by forging contracts and other documentations. The company reported the case to the local police and the employee has been taken into custody, according to the announcement. 
 Law firms Labaton Sucharow and Holzer &amp; Holzer have announced investigations into the company following the fraud disclosure. TAL’s shares dived over 23% in after-hours trading to US$42.80 per share. 
 For the fiscal year 2020 ended February 29, 2020, Light Class sales accounted for 3% to 4% of the company’s total estimated revenues, said TAL, without offering more details. 
 TAL introduced an app called Xue Er Si Light Class in 2018 to offer AI-enabled tutoring for primary school students, according to information found on Apple’s App Store. The firm also launched a device called Xue Er Si Light Box, which can be connected to a TV to offer online courses, Chinese media outlet  Techweb  reported. 
 Last Friday, Chinese on-demand beverage chain Luckin Coffee also admitted financial fraudulence and announced an internal investigation into the conduct of former chief operating officer Jian Liu, who is believed to have inflated revenues by 2.2 billion yuan (US$310.5 million).

644118,Future Indonesia: How cloud technology helps this game publisher expand,"   ﻿   
 (Additional reporting by  Nathaniel Fetalvero ) 
 The video game industry is booming. In Asia Pacific, the sector  raked in revenue worth US$71.4 billion  in 2018, surpassing North America, which earned US$32.7 billion. 
 Andi Suryanto  saw this potential  and founded Jakarta-based  Lyto  in 2003, at a time when Indonesia had relatively few online game publishers. 
 Adapting in the face of change 
 Lyto’s first-mover advantage granted it a quasi-monopoly in the Indonesian gaming industry – an asset that was short-lived, as foreign game companies quickly entered the market in the late 2000s. 
 Despite this, the firm has managed to remain one of the country’s  largest local gaming publishers , according to a 2017 Euromonitor study. 
 A key factor of Lyto’s success is its ability to keep pace with how the habits of gamers change. 
 “At the beginning of the company, we served online games for PC, but we [saw that] mobile phones and smartphones [were becoming] very popular, so we started actively launching games for smartphones as well,” Suryanto tells  Tech in Asia . 
 The startup’s first online game would go on  to win  the Best Casual Mobile Game award in 2013 at a local video game exhibition. Such recognition cemented Lyto’s position as a prominent player in the space. 
 Expanding the business 
 On top of expanding its range of products, Lyto is also working on broadening its reach beyond its home market. 
 “We’re based in Indonesia, but along the years, a lot of the games [became] very popular, and we wanted to expand to other countries,” says Suryanto. 
 Widening its reach, however, posed a challenge to the publisher. Because its titles were all online games, setting up in another country meant building large physical servers for data storage and network support, which could take up to several months. 
 To solve this issue, Lyto turned to cloud technology service provider  Alibaba Cloud . The firm’s  content delivery network  and  autoscaling  services made it easier for Lyto to expand into other countries without having to manually restructure its existing systems. Now, the startup can set up online operations in a new territory in less than a day. 
 According to Suryanto, Lyto is also exploring opportunities beyond just developing and publishing online games. 
 “We have our payment gateway services, and we’ve gone into the movie industry as well,” he says. “Hopefully we can give other more entertainment to the people in the region.” 
 
 This entry is part of the  Future Indonesia  series, which showcases how the digital transformation of Indonesian businesses is enabled by the use of cloud technology.

644344,RedDoorz takes tough measures to survive Covid-19," Like all players in the travel sector, Singapore-based budget hotel startup RedDoorz has been “drastically affected” by Covid-19, Amit Saberwal, the founder and CEO at RedDoorz, tells  Tech in Asia . As a result of the pandemic, the company saw an approximately 80% decrease in the volume of travel bookings and hotel occupancy. 
 Its Singapore business was the first to feel the effects because of its heavy reliance on inbound travelers, which mainly consist of Chinese tourists. 
 At the end of January, RedDoorz’s operations in Vietnam took a hit when the outbreak evolved to become a regional issue, and travel advisories and restrictions were beginning to be implemented. Its Indonesia and Philippine businesses were the next to be affected, as Covid-19 escalated into a pandemic.

 “As a firm, we have been taking some tough and necessary decisions that will ensure that we stay focused and committed towards […] property owners, employees, and investors,” says Saberwal. These measures include cost cutting, layoffs, and temporary furloughs, among others. 
 In 2019, the travel and tourism industry made up 12.1% of Southeast Asia’s total economy, offering 42.3 million jobs, according to the  World Travel and Tourism Council . 
 To mitigate the spread of Covid-19, however, countries are implementing lockdown measures and encouraging people to stay at home. This has led to a halt in traveling, causing revenue loss and job cuts for startups in the sector. 
 Myanmar-based travel startup  Flymya laid off a third of its headcount  this year as bookings dropped, while Indonesia’s Traveloka has also reportedly  cut around 10%  of its employees amid customer requests for refunds. Similarly, SoftBank-backed hotel chain Oyo placed “a significant number” of its employees on  temporary leave or furloughs , as it saw a 50% to 60% drop in revenue. 
 Cost reduction 
 To keep its business going, Saberwal says RedDoorz has had to implement belt-tightening measures in two waves. 
 The first was carried out before March 15, which was when the crisis was just beginning to unfold in Southeast Asian markets. These measures included cutting costs – such as its digital marketing spend and travel expenses – implementing 15% to 35% pay cuts for senior management, applying a hiring freeze, forfeiting variable pay, and delaying work appraisals, among others. 
 The firm implemented the second wave in April when the effects of the outbreak started to deepen across countries, especially in Indonesia, RedDoorz’s core market. The company offered temporary furloughs and laid off “less than 10%” of its total workforce in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, says Saberwal. 
 “We’re not ruling out taking more drastic measures based on how the situation develops,” notes the CEO. Startups need to make adjustments very carefully, especially when it comes to retrenchments because it won’t be easy rebuilding the team once it’s time to recover the business, he adds.

 For its hotel partners, RedDoorz has adjusted its commercial agreements with them, shifting from fixed-payment agreements to a more flexible revenue-sharing model for all its properties. Under the new scheme, RedDoorz will share a variable percentage of the revenue with its partners, depending on the amount generated over a period of time. 
 Even as startups struggle to keep cash flow stable, Saberwal says RedDoorz has enough funds to last until 2022. 
 “I think 2022 is the bare minimum that people should be actually planning for,” he says. However, the company is not ruling out raising more cash during this period in order to prepare for when the economy recovers. “2020 is the year where we continue to focus on our path to profitability,” he adds. 
 For now, RedDoorz is still sitting on piles of money: It secured  US$45 million  in a series B round led by Chinese VC firm Qiming Venture Partners, Jungle Ventures, and its network of limited partners last July. One month later, the startup went on to close a  US$70 million  series C round led by Asia Partners. 
 “Given the large impact that Covid-19 has on the hospitality sector globally, including in Southeast Asia, the company’s [RedDoorz] near-term focus needs to be on managing cost,” said Oliver Rippel, the co-founder and partner at Asia Partners. “We should also make sure that we remain ‘recovery ready’ whenever that may be.” 
 Good time for much-needed fixes 
 Despite the shock waves caused by Covid-19, Saberwal still sees the situation as an opportunity for RedDoorz to make some improvements. 
 It’s an “opportune time” for independent property owners to realize the importance of digitization and having an online presence, he says. For instance, RedFox, RedDoorz’s dynamic pricing and inventory management tool, could help property owners optimize their revenue and operational excellence. 
 The downturn could also serve as a chance for the company to make improvements to its back-end tech solutions, adjust price management features, retrain and upskill staff, as well as conduct the necessary renovations required at its properties.

 “It is a good time to be a startup,” Saberwal says. While some firms have more funds than others, there is always access to capital. “Decent companies will survive, and the better companies will become even better.” 
 When the economy eventually recovers, the CEO says RedDoorz will look to partner with more property owners. 
 Saberwal hasn’t closed off the possibility of M&amp;As either. “Today’s fierce competitors could be tomorrow’s mergers. […] Survival is the number one thing. It could be an M&amp;A, it could be a share swap, it could be working with a competitor, it could be whatever is best in the situation,” he shares. 
 For Saberwal, though, one thing is for sure: “The world is going to be changed forever post-Covid-19.” ",Doris Yu,0,5,"[(1, 0.85749346), (2, 0.14241633)]","['Oyo', 'Flymya', 'Saberwal', 'RedDoorz', 'SoftBank']","['Singapore', 'Myanmar', 'Asia', 'Philippines', 'Vietnam', 'Indonesia']"
644362,Oyo furloughs staff as revenues dip by 60%," Oyo has placed “a significant number” of its employees on temporary leave or furloughs of 60 to 90 days to ensure “long-term cash runway for the company,” its founder and group CEO, Ritesh Agarwal, said in a video message to Oyo staff. 
 
  Photo credit: Oyo 
 
 “At the latest, the revenues of Oyo and the occupancies have dropped by over 50% to 60%,” Agarwal said, adding that other leading hotel chains around the world have also seen declining revenues by over 75% and are continuing to get worse. Oyo previously reported a 10% to 15% drop in revenues and occupancy rates. 
 With the company’s balance sheet runway “under severe stress,” Oyo is looking at every controllable cost and is planning to reduce them, including capital expenditure, non-essential travel, and new expenses, among others. 
 Agarwal also said that he will forgo all his salary for the year, while the leadership team has agreed to take pay cuts of 25% to over 50%. 
 The company clarified that health benefits for its furloughed staff will continue. 
 According to the founder, the Covid-19 crisis comes at a “very unique time for Oyo,” which announced earlier this year that it’s  restructuring  its operations to boost profitability. The exercise would see layoffs of about 5,000 to 25,000 people in China, the US, and India. 
 Agarwal, however, emphasized that “we intend to do no or negligible layoffs as a part of cost restructuring across the world.” 
 The chief exec shared that Oyo’s China business has seen occupancy rise by 5% week on week in the last few weeks. Its vacation home business in Denmark has also seen its booking losses reduced as well. 
 “I am confident that Oyo will emerge stronger and more resilient than ever before outside of this crisis,” he said. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(1, 0.13917433), (2, 0.86044824)]",['Oyo'],"['US', 'Denmark', 'India', 'China']"
643900,Korea’s ecommerce market is still dominated by local players," Perhaps best known for K-pop, kimchi, cars, and consumer electronics, South Korea’s modest population of approximately 50 million people is also fostering the rapid growth of an outsized ecommerce industry – and it’s dominated by local players.

 Amazon is notable by its absence, and even the powerful family-run conglomerates that dominate most sectors of the local economy aren’t running the show. 
 Instead, locally bred unicorns and a host of startups are battling it out for a slice of the US$78 billion forecast to be spent online in 2020. In fact, half of Korea’s 10 unicorns are in online retail in some form. 
 King of the mountain 
 Korea’s  chaebol  (family-run conglomerates like Samsung and LG) have lorded over the offline retail food chain since the 1960s. Mom and pop shops scraped the dregs of the market, but few mid-tier businesses had any significant impact. 
 However, everything changed in 2010. 
 The year marked the founding of four companies that would all go on to become unicorns battling for supremacy in a market they created and continue to dominate today. Those companies are Ticket Monster (TMON), Wemakeprice, Woowa Brothers, and Coupang. 
 The following four years saw over US$428 million worth of investment being pumped into Korean ecommerce. The market exploded, running on a tech infrastructure that Korea’s telcos had previously set in place. 
 Coupang and Wemakeprice were originally daily deals businesses similar to Groupon, but both companies’ business models quickly evolved to involve third-party sellers like eBay. 
 Coupang went on to achieve unicorn status in 2014 and then famously pulled out of a planned initial public offering at the 11th hour. It then reinvented itself a second time as an “open market,” not unlike Amazon’s. In fact, this move earned Coupang the appellation “Amazon of Korea.” The real Amazon, though, is yet to make a dent on the country’s ecommerce market. 
 With a US$9 billion valuation, Coupang is now the no. 1 online shopping site in Korea. 
 Wemakeprice, on the other hand, achieved unicorn status in 2019, while TMON would have also shared the moniker if it hadn’t been acquired in 2011. 
 Fresh markets 
 Another Korean unicorn that lost its horn through acquisition is Woowa Brothers, the developer of food delivery app Baedal Minjeok (Baemin). The company became a unicorn in 2018 and was acquired in December 2019 by German food delivery company Delivery Hero for US$4 billion. 
 Baemin is Korea’s top food delivery service and is competing with Coupang and others in the last-mile space, offering one-hour delivery on a wide range of convenience items. 
 “Korea is the most advanced food delivery market in the world, including tech innovations in the space, the number and development of large players, and its rapid market growth,” said Woowa Brothers’ head of investment Jongho Joo in a 2020 ecommerce report. 
 Through its acquisition, Woowa Brothers has enough capital to ensure that Baemin will remain a tough competitor against Coupang. 
 Changing preferences 
 According to Joo, Korea’s ecommerce market is still growing, “so there’s still room for players in the space to expand, including offering new products and services within specific niches.” 
 While he is pessimistic about the chances of newcomers at this late stage, Koreans’ ever-changing preferences may yet prove him wrong. Indeed, many startups are enjoying rapid growth, thanks to successfully launching niche products and services across the sprawling ecommerce ecosystem. Other companies that have been around for a while have also managed to appeal to younger generations in ways that Coupang and the others have failed to. 
 The economic power of Korea’s younger generation, for instance, remains a contributing factor to the viability of new entrants to the market. Young families, for example, are frequenting secondhand ecommerce sites in droves to trade in items that their children have outgrown. The freshly prepared food from online grocery service Market Kurly is popular among working mothers as well. 
 Another ecommerce firm, fashion giant Musinsa, recently gained unicorn status in November 2019. Founded in 2001, Musinsa evolved from an online photo-sharing community for shoe lovers into a street fashion aggregator with its own private label, Musinsa Standard. 
 Its rivals include Balaan and D.code, two designer fashion ecommerce startups that were founded in 2015 and 2016, respectively. 
 “The market surely has just begun to bloom. The time seems ripe for vertical platforms to emerge as top leaders of their respective categories,” says Hyung-rok Choi, Balaan’s founder and CEO.

644343,"China’s largest streaming service, iQiyi, hit with fraud allegations"," Just days after short-seller Muddy Waters’ allegations of malfeasance at Luckin Coffee were vindicated, with Luckin admitting it fabricated sales worth over US$310 million, the equity research firm announced its short position in Chinese online streaming service iQiyi via Twitter. 
 Muddy Waters alleged Tuesday morning that iQiyi, the largest streaming service in China in terms of users, fabricated its revenue and number of users.

 Iqiyi stocks tumbled 11.2% following the announcement, but bounced back 3.2% at US$17.30 as of market close on Tuesday. Shares of its parent company, Chinese search engine Baidu, also dropped by 1.1% to US$101.79. 
 Muddy Waters said it assisted financial research and due diligence firm Wolfpack Research with an investigation into iQiyi, which involved surveys of 1,563 people within iQiyi’s target demographic in China between October and November 2019. 
 The 37-page report concluded that iQiyi inflated its 2019 revenue by approximately 8 billion yuan to 13 billion (US$1.1 billion to US$1.8 billion), or 27% to 44%. According to the research, iQiyi also overstated its user numbers by 42% to 60%. 
 According to iQiyi’s annual report for 2019, the company had total revenues of US$4.2 billion, indicating a 16% increase from the prior year. Additionally, as of December 2019, the number of total subscribers reached 106.9 million, up 22% year on year, with 98.9% of them being paying users. 
 “Like so many other China-based companies who IPO with inflated numbers, iQiyi is unable to legitimately grow their business enough to true up their financial statements,” reads the Wolfpack Research report. 
 It also questioned iQiyi’s pre-IPO performances. “When compared to IQ’s prospectus, we found that the deferred revenues reported to the SEC were inflated by 261.7%, 165.5%, and 86.2% in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.” 
 Beijing-based iQiyi replied to the allegations, saying that the report contains numerous errors, unsubstantiated statements, and misleading conclusions and interpretations. 
 “[Iqiyi] has always been and will remain committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and internal control, as well as transparent and timely disclosure in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Global Select Market,” the firm said in the press release. 
 Yesterday, Holzer &amp; Holzer, an investment and security fraud law firm, announced it has started to investigate whether iQiyi complied with federal securities laws. 
 The allegation comes soon after Chinese coffee chain Luckin was hit with a sales fraud scandal, which sent the latter’s stock plunging by 83% to US$4.39 within days,  KrAsia  reported. In January, Muddy Waters was short Luckin, citing an 89-page anonymous investigative report supported by 11,260 hours of store traffic video footage. The once rising stock is now facing lawsuits from several US-based law firms on behalf of investors, including Hagens Berman and Kahn Swick &amp; Foti. 
 Luckin submitted a filing to SEC last Thursday announcing an internal investigation into the conduct of former chief operating officer Jian Liu, who is believed to have inflated revenues by 2.2 billion yuan (US$310.5 million). 
 Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Beijing-based TAL Education Group, a K-12 after-school tutoring services provider, also disclosed that, during its internal auditing process, it has found inflated class sales, according to a company’s press release.

644322,Payments firm Ksher scores $10m in series A+ round led by MindWorks,"  Ksher , a cross-border payments solutions provider, has secured nearly US$10 million in a series A+ round led by MindWorks Capital. 
 The fundraise saw participation from undisclosed strategic investors from Japan and China, according to a statement. The round follows Ksher’s seed round from Infinity Venture Partners and series A funding from Sequoia Capital China.

 Founded in 2016, Ksher operates a mobile payments platform that enables overseas merchants to receive funds from different payment methods such as Alipay, WeChat Pay, and UnionPay. This past year, it has also connected to global e-wallets like AirPay, Line Pay, and Grab Pay. 
 The company initially focused on helping merchants reach the rising number of Chinese outbound travelers, but it has since expanded to offer hardware, point-of-sale system integrations, and app development to support multicurrency and multiple e-wallet transactions. 
 It also recently rolled out marketing solutions for merchants such as brand marketing, online retail, booking and delivery support, as well as customized membership features. 
 With the new funds, Ksher CEO Bryan Zhou said the firm plans to further expand its presence and capabilities through partnerships with financial institutions and government agencies. 
 Right now, the startup collaborates with banks – such as Rakuten Bank in Japan, Mashraq Bank in the UAE, and Ribank in Russia – to provide more localized services, along with partnerships with the Thai Immigration Bureau and the Thailand Ministry of Interior. The company obtains licenses in its operational jurisdictions, according to the statement. 
 More than just increasing collaboration, the funds would also allow Ksher to add new solutions, such as financing, installment plans, membership systems, loyalty points, and coupons. 
 Headquartered in Beijing, the company operates in 14 countries including Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. To date, it claims to have onboarded more than 100,000 merchants and processed more than US$1 billion in transaction volume across all of its markets.

 SoftBank-backed hospitality giant  Oyo ’s struggle in the US continues as it recently had to let go of a substantial chunk of its workforce in the country.

 Juggling between restructuring its global operations (which kicked off late last year) to become profitable and surviving the Covid-19 pandemic that has crushed hotel demand worldwide, Oyo has ended up with no choice but to hand over pink slips to its employees in the US. 
 Local media  Economic Times , citing sources, reported that Oyo has finally laid off “hundreds of employees” in America across divisions like sales, business development, and human resources over the last three weeks. 
 This is Oyo’s second round of layoffs in the US. In late January, the Indian hotel startup reportedly fired about 360 people, almost a third of its total American workforce. At the time, the company had already let go of “5% of its 12,000 employees in China partly due to non-performance and dismissed 12% of its 10,000 staff in India,” as per a  Bloomberg  report. 
 In an email announcing the layoffs to its American team, Oyo chief operating officer Abhinav Sinha said that the company’s new mantra was going to be “sustainable growth and profitability,” which would “help the company embark on the next phase.” 
 Since then, the situation has worsened as the coronavirus outbreak turned into a pandemic. And Oyo, like every other hotel chain, has seen its business crumble in the US. The  Economic Times  report, citing sources, said the company has reduced its investment in US hotels to one-fourth of what it was spending earlier. 
 “Oyo is expecting a long lull in the US and is laying off a lot of people in its corporate division along with some hotel employees. Finance and operations are very thinly manned and others are being asked to go,” The  Economic Times  report said, citing a person familiar with the matter. “Costs there are very high and the leadership thinks accounted cash flows will go out of order if costs are not brought down drastically.” 
 An Oyo spokesperson told The  Economic Times  that the “pandemic has impacted the hospitality industry at a global scale and Oyo is not immune to it,” and that “it would shortly announce further details as we finalize specific decisions to ensure Oyo’s long-term success.” 
 However, the trouble for Oyo is much deeper than the steep slump in demand due to travel restrictions across the globe to prevent the further spread of Covid-19. According to the report, an employee who was sacked in the first week of April said Oyo has been struggling to continue giving high salaries in the US, and the lack of transparency with American hotel partners has compounded the problems for the company. 
 Oyo has been trying to turn things around in the US where it entered in February 2019. Since late March, the company has been offering its rooms for free to American medical and healthcare professionals fighting coronavirus. 
 Although the move might not benefit Oyo immediately, it is likely to improve its brand image and cement its relationships with US authorities and the healthcare community.

644315,"Korean grocery startup Kurly secures $164m from Sequoia, Hillhouse, DST"," Online grocery delivery startup  Kurly  has raised US$164 million in new funding in a series E round led by new shareholder DST Global. 
 It was rounded off by existing investors Sequoia Capital China, Hillhouse Capital, SK Networks, Translink Capital, Aspex Management, and Fuse Venture Partners, according to a statement. 
   Kurly CEO Sophie Kim / Photo credit: Market Kurly  
 Also known as Market Kurly, the company was launched in 2015 by former Goldman Sachs and Temasek analyst Sophie Kim. It lets users order groceries such as eggs, bread, and vegetables through its website and receive them the following morning. 
 It plans to use the new funds to establish a new fulfillment center in 
the Seoul Metropolitan area, which will be more than twice as large as its current centers. 
 Kurly also aims to speed up customer acquisition and make new hires. As of April this year, the company claims to have roughly 5 million registered users on its platform. 
  Korean Investors  previously reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that Kurly raised US$150 million in the round, valuing the firm at roughly US$780 million. 
 The funding round follows a recent surge in online shopping brought by the Covid-19 outbreak. However, the foreign investors noted that Kurly had to reach or surpass its proposed sales target, the sources said. 
 The new capital also comes months after it was reported that Kurly was in consideration to be acquired by its rivals Shinsegae and CJ Corp. 
 “As competition in the fresh food delivery market is becoming fierce, Kurly has fallen short of expectations compared to its early stage. But its strong brand is the most appealing factor for investors,” said one of the sources. 
 In 2019, Kurly saw its losses more than double to roughly US$80.3 million, even as its sales nearly tripled to about US$354 million. SSG.com, Shinsegae’s online mall, also posted losses last year, with SoftBank-backed Coupang, another contender in the market, expected to report a rise in shortfalls.

 Launched in 2016, Rise works with corporates and governments across the region to help set up and scale innovation initiatives from outside and within the organization. 
 It plans to use the new funds to scale its tech-enabled platform and take its services beyond Thailand to Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Leveraging the network it has developed so far, the company will also “localize our service portfolios to each market’s needs,” said Rise co-founder and CEO Kid Parchariyanon. 
 According to the statement, the company has built a global ecosystem that includes more than 400 corporations, over 2,000 startups, and upward of 20,000 corporate investors. 
 In July last year, Rise announced it was bringing its accelerator services to Singapore through a  partnership  with the government-linked business development agency Enterprise Singapore. 
 The program enables participating startups to plug into Thailand’s innovation ecosystem and work with local partners. It also gives more than 1,000 growth-stage startups in Rise’s network a chance to make Singapore the first Southeast Asian country they expand to outside of Thailand. 
 Rise and Enterprise Singapore have since announced the launch of Rise.AI, a corporate AI accelerator program that looks to bring 30 AI startups from across the globe to Southeast Asia.

 Japan’s SBI Holdings and China’s 9F Group, both investors in Investree’s series B fundraise, also participated in the new round, according to a statement.

 The money will go into further developing the company’s services and fueling its regional expansion strategy, said the startup. It also aims to fast-track its growth in the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia, which currently faces a US$430 billion credit gap, Investree said. 
 According to Investree co-founder and CEO Adrian Gunadi, the new capital will help the company support Indonesian small- and medium-sized enterprises affected by Covid-19. 
 “Our platform is robust and our financial position secure, thereby enabling us to navigate the current climate with confidence,” the head exec added. 
 Founded in 2015, Investree operates a lending marketplace for SMEs for both conventional and Shariah businesses. As of this month, the company claims to have recorded a total loan facility of 5.1 trillion rupiah (US$313.2 million) and has disbursed about US$235.2 million. 
 The startup first announced that it was raising a series C round in September last year. Gunadi had told  KrAsia  in an interview that the company had held talks with investors from  Japan, China, and South Korea , some of the markets it was looking to enter.

644275,Edtech startup closes $7.5m series B round led by Ant Financial-backed BAce," Following a string of investments in Indian education startups this year, local edtech firm  Lido Learning  has announced the close of its series B round at US$7.5 million. The round pushes its total capital raised to US$10.5 million. 
 The capital injection was led by Ant Financial-backed BAce Capital, while new investors including Picus Capital and Paytm president Madhur Deora, along with several existing investors in Lido, also participated in the round.

 Launched in April 2019, Lido aims to provide a one-size-fits-all solution to education in India through interactive online tutorials. Every session has a maximum of six students to ensure that each child receives attention and personalized feedback. 
 Students are also given customized homework, remedial help, and challenges based on class performance. 
 With the new funds, Lido aims to extend its reach into the less populated towns in India and expand into more curriculum-focused subjects. Right now, its online coaching sessions are focused on math and science for Class 5 to Class 9 students – typically children who are 10 to 15 years old – across all major cities. 
 According to Lido’s founder and CEO Sahil Sheth, online tutorials are set to take off in India, owing to the country’s high-speed internet penetration. “And as more students and parents experiment with online learning in the current pandemic, the customer mindset is ready,” he added. 
 Lido is BAce Capital’s first edtech investment in India, and the move is part of the latter’s strategy to invest in early-stage companies in emerging economies, focusing on India and Southeast Asia. 
 Several other edtech companies have raised funds this year. 
 In January, Bengaluru-based  InterviewBit  secured  US$20 million  in a series A raise led by Sequoia India and Tiger Global. In contrast to Lido, InterviewBit offers computer science courses aimed at creating job-ready professionals. 
  WizKlub , another startup from Bengaluru, also raised nearly  US$1 million  in seed funding this year and looks to further enhance its AI-based product and expand to other markets. 
 More recently,  Vedantu  in February secured  US$24 million  in an extended series C round led by GGV Capital, pushing its total funding to US$85 million to date. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(1, 0.9996382)]","['InterviewBit', 'Paytm', 'Bengaluru']","['Lido', 'India', 'AI']"
644222,Video streaming in Asia is not for the faint of heart," Asia’s video-streaming startups are finding just how tough the going can be as they contend with the steep costs of producing content for consumers who are price conscious and spoiled for choice. 
 The latest player tripped up by the fierce competition is Singtel-backed Hooq, which  filed   for liquidation last month. A joint venture that also involves Sony Pictures Television and Warner Bros. Entertainment, Hooq wasn’t able to provide sustainable returns nor cover escalating content and operating costs amid structural changes in the over-the-top (OTT) video scene, a company spokesperson tells  Tech in Asia.

 The high costs of content likely dragged down Hooq’s financials, according to analysts at Fitch Solutions. “Streaming players will need to justify greater content investments with the ability to drive higher-value subscription growth,” they say. 
 
   All figures in millions of US dollars  Source: Hooq, ACRA 
 
 Hooq’s average revenue per user would be just US$0.11 (S$0.15) in the quarter that ended in March of last year, estimates Fitch Solutions. 
 In May 2019, Singtel announced Hooq’s revenue doubled for the financial year that ended in March 2019 from a year earlier. By June, the Singaporean telecommunications giant said it was looking at unlocking value through a potential initial public offering or a sale of a stake in Hooq to a new strategic partner. 
 Southeast Asia poses a challenge for OTT companies such as Hooq, given the insufficient levels of disposable income in the region’s emerging markets and the abundance of low-cost local competitors, according to Fitch Solutions. 
 Hooq’s troubles are emblematic of local businesses in developing markets that go head-to-head with global heavyweights such as Netflix, which have deep pockets due to their seemingly unlimited access to relatively cheap capital from public sources. 
 That financial advantage helps major players sustain operations in a competitive environment driven by affordable prices. Meanwhile, regional firms are finding themselves running out of firepower, more so now because of the downtrend brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.

 Singtel’s sudden decision to  shut down  Hooq came as a surprise to some of the startup’s senior staff. “At the start of the year, we were evaluating options to close operations in our weakest markets such as India and the Philippines,” recalls a former Hooq executive who didn’t want to be named. 
 The economic slump stemming from this public health crisis may have accelerated Singtel’s decision to pull the plug on Hooq, the source says. But business conditions were already unfavorable even before the coronavirus outbreak. 
 A spokesperson explained that while Hooq had been raising funds, it didn’t secure any further investment this year – an outcome that’s related to the company’s “insufficient growth” instead of Covid-19. 
 Iflix, Hooq’s Malaysia-based competitor, appears to be struggling as well, racking up  accumulated losses of US$378.5 million  since it was co-founded by Patrick Grove, Luke Elliott and Mark Britt in 2014. 
 Streaming services seem to have adopted the Silicon Valley model, notes Thomas Barker, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham’s Malaysia campus (UNMC) who specializes in media, communication, and creative industries. “You pump in money, take on a lot of debt, cut prices, and hope that customers will take it up in a big way.” 
 These firms are banking on market dominance to kill the competition, Barker contends, and that might have been the case with Hooq. “They were well-backed by Singtel, Warner Bros., etc., but the market was just waiting for the first one to collapse.” 
 For those that survive, the potential rewards are huge. The online video industry in Asia Pacific will generate US$50 billion in advertising and subscription revenue by 2024, says Media Partners Asia.

 Hooq’s exit leaves Southeast Asia up for grabs between Iflix, Hong Kong-based Viu, and Netflix, says Fitch Solutions. Regional players will need more funding to stay in the game, though raising funds amid the worsening economic environment hasn’t been easy. 
 For instance,  Iflix’s IPO , which was originally scheduled for the end of 2019, remains on hold, and the company has laid off most of its senior management executives in an effort to reduce costs. Iflix raised US$30 million in July from US fund manager Fidelity that slashed its valuation by 25% to US$300 million, ex-employees told  The Ken .

 But so far, none of the regional OTT providers have been able to reach a scale that would make their businesses viable and sustainable. 
 Among the difficulties they face include unreliable internet infrastructures as well as underdeveloped payment platforms across Southeast Asia, says Barker. Trying to build a regional audience is also hard because of linguistic and cultural differences between countries, he adds. 
 But a big homogeneous market presents its own hurdles. 
 Going all in 
 Nowhere is the free-for-all more evident than in India. Global majors seeking a huge and high-potential market have poured millions of dollars to create and license content in the country. 
 India is set to be one of the world’s top 10 media markets by 2021, with revenue estimated to hit US$52.7 billion in 2022 from US$30.4 billion in 2017,  according  to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). 
 As home to one of the world’s  largest  English-speaking populations, India offers a significant opportunity within Asia. In comparison, China’s censorship, homegrown giants, and linguistic challenges make it an almost no-go for international players. 
 The PwC report also found that the Indian OTT market is expected to reach a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.6%, hitting US$823 million through 2022 from US$296.7 million in 2017, says PwC. It will outperform the 10.1% CAGR growth in the worldwide video OTT market. 
 Video-streaming services are relatively inexpensive in India. Netflix’s mobile-only plan, for example, costs about US$2.6 a month. Hotstar and Disney+ plans start at about US$0.43 per month while Amazon Prime’s plans start at about US$1.7. 
 Despite the cheap prices, global majors aren’t shying away from investing. Netflix is plowing roughly US$400 million into India through 2019 and 2020 for original and syndicated content. In early 2018, Amazon said that it will plunk down some US$263 million in original local content. 
 “We just made a decision to double down in our Prime Video investments here in India,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos  said   at a conference in January. “It is doing well everywhere, but there’s nowhere it’s doing better than in India.” 
 With slick marketing and movie-standard budgets, Amazon Prime launched India-focused series such as  Mirzapur , and  Inside Edge . Meanwhile, Netflix roped in Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan to headline crime drama  Sacred Games , which was  a smashing success . 
 Cold start 
 Meanwhile, Hotstar, India’s dominant video on-demand player, is in the midst of an identity crisis. 
 It provides streaming services under a subscription and advertising package, but its ad revenue has taken a hit in the wake of Covid-19. The pandemic has indefinitely postponed the Indian Premier League, the country’s leading cricketing event. Hotstar  got the streaming rights   via its parent firm Star India’s US$2.55 billion purchase for global media rights through 2022. 
 Following a one-week delay in its India launch, Disney’s streaming service debuted on April 3 at roughly US$20 per year. The US entertainment juggernaut took control of Hotstar after its  US$71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox  in 2019.

 A struggle within Hotstar’s management since the deal is adding to the company’s woes. Executives from both companies are clashing on everything from content and strategy to company culture, several former and current employees tell  Tech in Asia . 
 Hotstar has also seen a string of exits from its senior leadership. “The 36th floor was mostly empty even before the [Covid-19] outbreak,” said an employee who asked for anonymity. The source was referring to the executive floor at Hotstar’s headquarters. 
  Tech in Asia  reached out to Hotstar and Disney, but they didn’t respond to requests for comment. 
 Opportunity in adversity 
 Despite its detrimental impact on the economy at large, Covid-19 could be a silver lining for OTT players since stay-at-home measures across the world are projected to result in an explosion of online consumption, analysts say. 
 OTT providers are expected to ramp up ads and promotions to gain market share during this period, Kenny Liew, a Fitch Solutions’ analyst tells  Tech in Asia . He cites the example of how Iflix has made its entire catalogue free for Malaysian subscribers. “They’re likely hoping that a portion of these free users will convert to paid subscriptions.” 
 Those with the scale now have a “golden opportunity” to double down on investment and expansion in the Asia-Pacific region, says Vivek Couto, an executive director of Media Partners Asia. “Moves over the next three to six months will define winners in 2021 and beyond.” 
 Netflix and Viu have done reasonably well in Southeast Asia while HBO Go is growing at a steady pace, Couto notes. 
 “Everyone sort of rushed into Asia… but it is quite a fragmented market,” says UNMC’s Barker. “A single Southeast Asian market is near impossible.” ",Kenan Machado,0,7,"[(2, 0.9999119)]","['Disney', 'Hotstar', 'OTT', 'Netflix', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers', 'HBO', 'Fidelity', 'Iflix', 'Amazon', 'Hooq']","['US', 'Hotstar', 'Asia', 'Iflix', 'India', 'Malaysia', 'Philippines', 'Bollywood', 'China']"
644192,How being spun off from its parent firm helped this deep-tech startup reach new heights," Residents of Singapore would be familiar with the country’s Light Fire Attack Vehicles, known affectionately as the Red Rhinos. They’re essentially lighter, more compact fire trucks that can access narrower spaces and be deployed closer to fire and rescue incidents. 
 These vehicles were a product of one of the many projects undertaken by Singapore-based engineering firm  Hope Technik , which has also created automatic inspection vehicles and automated temperature screening stations, among others. 
 Founded in 2006, Hope Technik also developed Sesto, a sub-unit focused on creating autonomous robots that can make moving heavy objects in confined spaces easier. The product was invented after the firm’s founders saw a demand for such devices in the logistics sector. 
 In 2018, Sesto came into its own and was spun off as  Sesto Robotics . 
 Since then, the startup has expanded to designing autonomous mobile robots that can be used in the manufacturing and healthcare industries. 
 These robots can carry out repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as loading or transporting items. They also use laser-guided, intelligent systems to avoid obstacles and map out routes. 
 Spin off 
 Spinoffs are common in the tech space, which companies do for  various reasons , such as targeting key propositions or attracting  more investments . Some of these offshoot enterprises have also gone on to become incredibly successful. For instance, Microsoft established its  Expedia division  in 1999 as a separate entity, which has since seen the rise of a travel-booking giant. 
 Sesto Robotics is looking to achieve the same kind of success by getting the right investors on board and developing its products further. 
 The move could help the company raise more funds, as it has a very different approach compared to its parent firm. Although Hope Technik works to deliver customized solutions to its clients, Sesto Robotics focuses specifically on developing its own products, as a mobile robotics manufacturer. 
 “Investors prefer to invest in a company with a clear product and market strategy,” explains Ang Chor Chen, CEO of Sesto Robotics. “If we remained a part of Hope, we would have been part of a different business with different markets.”

 Additionally, Sesto Robotics is a deep-tech startup, which often  struggle to get funding  due to their status as being “high risk, high reward.” As such, reaching the right investors is extremely vital for these firms. 
 “Deep tech is not a category many venture capitalists focus on, so we have to be very targeted in approaching the right investors to ensure a fit between us and their investment mandates,” says Ang. 
 So far, the decision to split has paid off. In 2018, Sesto Robotics secured  US$2.9 million in series A funding  and received additional investment from Trive Ventures through the Singapore government’s  Startup SG Equity program . 
 Seeing success 
 Earlier this year, Micron Singapore, one of Sesto Robotics’ oldest clients, was announced as a member of the World Economic Forum’s  Global Lighthouse Network , a community of manufacturers that apply cutting-edge technology to drive impact. The network’s roster includes names like Unilever, Siemens, and GlaxoSmithKline. 
 “[Micron Singapore] was selected, and our robots were featured,” says Ang. “[The company] acknowledged through an email that we have been a very key part of them winning this accolade, which was very affirming.”

 Other than the media coverage of the network, which got Sesto Robotics’ name out into the wider market, the recognition also shows that the startup is operating at a global standard and is heading in the right direction. 
 “Our customers are really reaping the benefits of automation and robotics,” the CEO remarks. “That’s the real satisfaction.” 
 Looking to the future 
 As many industries turn to automation, Sesto Robotics is exploring better solutions for its customers. Some of the improvements it aims to make include reducing the time it takes to set up its robots in a new location, as well as making the interface user-friendly. 
 “We want to make the robots as easy as possible to use so that even regular factory operators with minimal training will be able to utilize robots effectively,” says Ang. 
 This will increase the adoption rate of the company’s robots and support its efforts to scale its solutions, he adds, especially since Sesto Robotics plans to enter Europe in the latter half of 2020. 
 In the future, Ang envisions that the company’s robots will be self-dispatching – able to anticipate needs on the factory floor and deploy themselves in the most efficient way. 
 While many believe  robots will end up displacing humans , Ang thinks  this view is pessimistic . 
 “Automation will enable workers to be more productive and create smarter, safer environments for humans,” he says.

644262,WeWork sues SoftBank over canceled $3b tender offer," The special committee of  WeWork ‘s board said it is suing SoftBank after the investment giant  withdrew its US$3 billion tender offer  for the embattled startup.

 In a lawsuit filed yesterday, the co-working firm said SoftBank has breached its obligations under their agreement by failing to deliver on their deal. WeWork now wants the Japanese conglomerate to complete the tender offer or pay compensatory damages. 
 SoftBank’s offer to buy shares of WeWork was part of a US$9.5 billion bailout package that came after an unsuccessful attempt at going public set WeWork on a downhill path. It also includes a US$1.5 billion injection from SoftBank and US$5 billion in debt financing. 
 Last week, SoftBank said it will not be moving forward with the deal due to regulatory probes and unment requirements. 
 “The special committee regrets the fact that SoftBank continues to put its own interests ahead of those of WeWork’s minority stockholders,” WeWork’s camp said. “Instead of abiding by its contractual obligations, SoftBank, under increasing pressure from activist investors, has engaged in a purposeful campaign to avoid completion of the tender offer.” 
 According to WeWork, SoftBank has already received most of the benefits provided under the initial tender offer agreement, including board control over the startup and “additional economic benefits.” 
 The company also claims that the Masayoshi Son-led firm purposefully pursued a separate transaction with minority investors in WeWork’s joint venture in China to make sure the tender offer would not go through, as it is one of the conditions to closing the deal. 
 Less than three weeks ago, SoftBank said that it “ continues to honor its obligations ” under the agreement. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(2, 0.9995713)]","['Masayoshi', 'WeWork', 'SoftBank']",['China']
644217,SME-focused fintech firm Neat banks $11m in series A funding,"  Neat , a fintech startup from Hong Kong that provides financial services to small businesses, said it has raised US$11 million in a series A round.

 The capital injection was led by private investment group Pacific Century, and was rounded off by payments giant Visa and the  newly launched  MassMutual Ventures Southeast Asia. Neat’s seed investors Dymon Asia Ventures, Linear Capital, and Sagamore Investments also chipped in, according to a statement. 
 In essence, the startup helps small- and medium-sized enterprises and startups open multicurrency business accounts and assists with company incorporation. The account lets companies send and receive money globally at more competitive exchange rates, as well as provide corporate expense cards for online and offline spending. 
 While it focuses more on business users, it also offers a consumer option. 
 The company said it plans to use the fresh capital to continue extending its reach internationally. After it opened an office in Shenzhen last year to target Chinese exporters, Neat set up base in London and is slated to kick off local operations in Western Europe to serve European entrepreneurs trading with China. 
 It plans to further invest in its customer support capabilities and further develop its customer acquisition channels across Southeast Asia, according to the firm. 
 The startup also announced that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Visa to begin issuing Visa credit cards aimed at cross-border companies within the next few months. Initially, Neat only provided Mastercard-based options. 
 According to data from Crunchbase, the current fundraise boosts the company’s total funding to US$16 million. It previously raised US$2 million from Dymon Asia and Portag3 Ventures in July 2018, followed by a  US$3 million  venture round led by Linear Capital in October of the same year.

 Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, as well as existing investors Omnivore and AgFunder, also participated in this round, according to a statement.

 Founded in 2012, DeHaat aims to become a one-stop solution for agricultural services such as AI-based farm advisory, financial services, and distribution of segment-specific inputs. Its platform also aggregates harvests from farmers on their network to directly supply retail chains, ecommerce players, FMCG firms, and food processors. 
 With the new funds, DeHaat plans to scale up to 2,000 rural retail centers for last-mile delivery and farm produce aggregation, as well as boost the number of farmers on its network to 1 million by June 2021. Currently, the startup serves over 210,000 farmers and about 280 centers across India. 
 It also plans to use part of the new capital to automate its supply chain and boost its data analytics capability to drive efficiency. 
 According to Sequoia Capital India vice president Abhishek Mohan, DeHaat is capitalizing on India’s US$350 billion agriculture industry, which is powered by roughly 100 million small and independent farmers. “This industry is on the brink of a massive transformation with ease of regulation, farmers getting organized, and increasing smartphone penetration.” 
 DeHaat previously raised US$4 million in a pre-series A round in March last year, led by Omnivore and AgFunder. Since then, the startup claims its annual revenue has grown 3.5x. It received a top-up of US$3 million in venture debt from Trifecta Capital in May 2019. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.9994827)]","['AgFunder', 'FMO', 'DeHaat', 'FMCG']","['India', 'AI']"
644128,Crowdsourcing tech solutions to drive industry-wide innovation," For businesses, it’s no longer enough to put “implement digital solutions” on their to-do list. The reality is, they should already be in the midst of implementation and scaling, or they risk getting left behind by their competitors. It’s a difficult task, especially for large, established companies. 
 That said, the vast number of solutions out there can be overwhelming. Over the last 15 years, the global digital economy has exploded: It’s now valued at  US$11.5 trillion  and growing 2.5 times faster than the entire world’s gross domestic product. Accompanying this growth is the expansion of the IT services industry, with spending on IT services, infrastructure, and software projected to  rise by 3.7% in 2020 . 
 How can businesses sort through all of these options to find solutions that actually work for their unique challenges? 
 Opening the gates 
 This was a real dilemma faced by Japanese insurance firm  Sompo , which is in the process of digitally transforming its international business. “We’re not looking for technologies for the sake of technology. [Instead, we’re seeking] technologies that can activate our digital culture,” says Patrick Chin, the company’s head of digital and branding for Asia Pacific.

 The firm decided to seek outside help for a solution and landed on  the Open Innovation Platform (OIP) . 
 A brainchild of Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the program aims to accelerate digital innovation by serving as a platform that matches problems with tech solutions. 
 While most multinational corporations (MNCs) are likely unfamiliar with turning to crowdsourcing for help, there are benefits in doing so. With the platform, a company that wants to pursue cutting-edge technologies but lacks the resources can find a fix that’s both effective and tailored to its problem. 
 Many of the entities offering their solutions on OIP are also quick, agile, and ambitious startups. 
 “They are quite hungry to try new things and are quite flexible,” says Chin, sharing Sompo’s experience with the platform. 
 “In insurtech, we already have a lot of solutions that are coming to us, but they are sometimes too expensive, not scalable, or may not be in line with best practices. We wanted to explore different technology solutions that make a business impact,” he adds. 
 Solving for specifics 
 According to Chin, Sompo’s digitization strategy had two big stumbling blocks: general insurance remains a largely traditional and paper-based industry and many countries under his purview have diverse digital needs. The OIP presented an opportunity to address a number of these issues simultaneously, so the team submitted four entries for the problems it faced in three markets: Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. 
 Each country had its own challenges, Chin explained. In Malaysia, the company wanted a more efficient way to issue quotations to customers. With the OIP’s assistance, Sompo connected with a problem solver to create a system that quickly and accurately generates and delivers quotations. 
 In Singapore, on the other hand, the company wanted to improve its call centers’ efficiency, which receive an average of 30,000 calls a year. The solution: AI-powered chatbots. “It’s another way of talking to our customers as and when they need it,” Chin says. 
 Through the OIP, Sompo partnered with enterprise tech startup  Zumata . The Singapore-based firm was able to quickly build a prototype and got generally positive results, says Chin. Plans are already underway to launch the chatbot in Sompo’s other markets. 
 Not just for one 
 It’s one thing to solve issues for the digital needs of businesses, but what about organizations like trade associations and councils whose mandates cut across the bounds of a single company? IMDA made sure its platform could cater to this market as well, creating a new category for sector-wide challenges. It aims to help find solutions that have the potential to be scaled across and benefit entire industries. 
 One of the OIP’s problem-owner partners is the  Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) , a trade association and chamber which represents more than 3,000 member manufacturing companies, consisting of small and medium-sized enterprises as well as MNCs and affiliate members. 
 “We want to become a manufacturing sector that leverages technology to address a lot of old, labor-intensive types of problems,” says Nicholas Ngoh, the director of corporate and council affairs at SMF. Labor and resource limitations and human error are just some examples of such legacy challenges.

 To overcome these obstacles, the federation, with help from the OIP, is developing a manufacturing-as-a-service (MaaS) platform. The MaaS would be designed to match factories’ spare capacities with small or nascent businesses that are interested in testing out new products but are hampered by inadequate resources. “If you are a new business owner, you don’t have to start your own factory,” Ngoh explains. Instead, they can log into the MaaS portal and search for factories with the available capacity. 
 The tie-up also gave SMF an opportunity to learn about the diversity of available solutions. 
 “By going through the open-source kind of market place, you never know what may turn up,” Ngoh says. 
 Supporting the movement 
 With both Sompo and SMF, IMDA provides support and plays the parts of advisor and liaison. This is especially crucial when legacy companies are trying out digital prototypes, and IMDA provides guided assistance and support throughout the entire innovation process. 
 “At this point, the tech market is quite diverse, so it really depends on track record, which is really what we are looking for,” Ngoh says. “[The OIP] is kind of a semi-regulated environment because it’s got the IMDA behind it, we have confidence.” 
 He adds that the agency assisted with everything from drafting the problem statement and creating the presentations with the problem solvers, as well as collating and managing responses. “IMDA was brilliant at making it a pain-free journey and just leaving it to us to make the decisions that mattered,” shares Ngoh. 
 Chin echoes the sentiment. “For us to do a transformation is not easy. When there are other motivators like IMDA or the OIP program that can help us along the way, it allows me to engage better with my internal stakeholders.” 
 
 IMDA’s Open Innovation Platform provides tech startups with the opportunity to work with large enterprises and have their solutions adopted on a sector-wide scale, while problem owners can find tailored tech-based solutions to the issues they face.

644181,"“We will see a strong recovery” after Covid-19, just like SARS"," Dear readers, 
 Travel startups are among the hardest hit by Covid-19, which has spurred governments around the world to restrict movements across borders in an effort to control the pandemic. But companies in this sector are also the most optimistic. 
 “We will see a strong recovery,” Jane Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group, tells  Tech in Asia . “After SARS was under control, we saw double or triple the demand coming back very strongly. We cannot really isolate one country anymore. We believe countries can strategically ease travel restrictions, limiting the spread of the virus while allowing the flow of business once again.” 
   
 Adapting quickly to the fast-deteriorating business environment will be key for startups to survive. Sun and James Liang, the Shanghai-based firm’s chairman, will forego their salaries, while its senior management will voluntarily take pay cuts of up to 50%. The proposed annual merit increase for Trip.com’s frontline service staff will be processed as planned, while raises for other employees will be temporarily put on hold until the situation improves. 
 Myanmar-based Flymya has taken more drastic steps,  retrenching one-third of its 200-strong headcount . At the same time, the company is taking steps to scale down its user acquisition efforts and focusing on improving on its code base and processes  as demand for travel across the country drops . 
 In Indonesia, hospitality startup Airy is planning to enhance the quality of its properties and adopting new technologies as  business slows during this crisis . That’s a necessary step for the company, which has aggressively expanded its network of budget hotels across the archipelago over the last five years. 
 Let’s remain optimistic that governments will eventually succeed in managing the further spread of this  deadly disease . 
 For now, tougher action is needed. In Singapore,  schools and offices will be shut down  for a month until May 4. The government is also rolling out  additional measures  to help businesses and consumers cope with the economic fallout of Covid-19.

644174,"Indonesian accounting app raises seed funding from East Ventures, Sampoerna, others"," In Indonesia, over 60 million micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) rely on outdated methods of bookkeeping or don’t do it at all, said Abhinay Peddisetty, the co-founder of  BukuWarung , a digital bookkeeping startup. 
 The Indonesian company, which aims to help small merchants do business efficiently, has announced that it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding in a round led by East Ventures. 
 Golden Gate Ventures, Tanglin Venture Partners, and AC Ventures (a joint funding entity by  Agaeti Ventures and Convergence Ventures ) also participated in the round. Other backers include Indonesian billionaire Michael Sampoerna and strategic angel investors from Grab, Gojek, Flipkart, PayPal, Xendit, Rapyd, Alterra, and Zen Rooms, among others.

 BukuWarung said it will use the new funds to expand its Jakarta-based team across functions such as engineering, product, design, growth, and partnerships. 
 The accounting app tracks all transactions including credit, expense, and sales, helping merchants get cash flow visibility through business reports. 
 The company claims that merchants receive 3x faster repayments and see increased cash flow due to the automatic payment reminders sent by the app. They are also able to save US$6.70 in bookkeeping expenses on average . 
 The majority of merchants using BukuWarung are from tier-two and tier-three cities, according to a statement. 
 Within a few months of launching, millions of credit and cash transactions have been recorded on the app by over 250,000 MSMEs across more than 500 cities and small towns in Indonesia, according to the startup. 
 But Peddisetty said the company still has a long way to go. 
 “Despite the strong initial traction, we are still less than 1% done,” he said. “ Kasbon  [credit] drives up to 80% of their [micro merchants] business, which is why we decided to focus on digital bookkeeping as our initial product.” 
 Co-founder Chinmay Chauhan said the startup is looking into launching new features – such as sending links to customers that allow them to accept payments via digital wallets – to reduce potential exposure to the Covid-19 disease. “We’ve also partnered with healthcare startups to create awareness for Covid-19, as the safety of users is our number one priority right now,” he said. 
 Peddisetty and Chauhan, who both previously worked at Singapore marketplace app Carousell, launched the app in 2019. Adjie Purbojati, the founder of Lunasbos, a two-way accounting app for MSMEs in Indonesia, is also part of BukuWarung’s founding team.

644160,An influential new Indonesian VC could open doors for startups," Since it was founded in 2018,  Agaeti Ventures  has become a rising force among Indonesian VCs, currently being one of the most active investors in the country. Its general partner, Pandu Sjahrir, is the key man. 
 Beside investing in early-stage startups with Agaeti, Sjahrir has influence within tech unicorns: He’s a board member in Gojek and the Indonesia chairman of Sea. 
 He’s also armed with government connections, being the nephew of the Indonesian coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, who has a strong influence in foreign investment in the country. The minister is also involved in Indonesia’s plans to set up a  sovereign wealth fund  and  a new capital city . 
 
  Pandu Sjahrir (second from right) join the meeting between Indonesian president Joko Widodo and SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son / Photo credit: Jokowi’s Twitter account 
 
 Sjahrir is a prominent figure in the mining industry as well – a sector that contributes a  significant chunk  to the country’s gross domestic product. In addition to being the director of Toba Bara Sejahtra, a local publicly listed coal mining corporation, since 2010, he has also led the Indonesian Coal Mining Association for five years. 
 This influence and network has allowed Agaeti to run fast after its founding, setting up a US$10 million debut fund and deploying it to 27 startups in less than two years. 
 As with any VC, it will be years before Sjahrir can show any returns, so the verdict is still out. 
 Nonetheless, these are three of the promising startups in Agaeti’s belt: 
  Warung Pintar:  The startup brings roadside stalls online by implementing digital payments, inventory software, and data analytics. To date, the company already serves thousands of stalls. 
  Bizzy:  A company that aims to build a  more efficient supply chain network  for retailers. 
  Kargo:  Integrating shippers and logistics providers in a single marketplace, the startup counts Sequoia Capital and Uber founder Travis Kalanick as its investors. 
 Michael Soerijadji, another partner at Agaeti, was also the director in one of Toba Bara Sejahtra’s affiliates. He and Sjahrir not only have experience in mining and energy, he says, but also in the retail and manufacturing sector. 
 Joining forces 
 Agaeti recently announced  a “merger”  with fellow Indonesia-based VC firm Convergence Ventures, which will further increase Sjahrir’s influence. 
 Named AC Ventures, the combined entity has become  the second-most active VC in Indonesia , just behind East Ventures. Indeed, Sjahrir also has a tight connection with the latter, considering 65% of Agaeti’s disclosed portfolio companies have been co-invested with East Ventures. 
 Similar to its predecessors, AC Ventures aims to invest in early-stage Indonesian tech startups. It plans to put in a few million US dollars per deal for companies that operate in ecommerce (including social commerce), fintech, digital content services like edtech and healthtech, and those that enable micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises.

 Today, AC Ventures is still fundraising for its debut fund, though it has refused to give details on the target and timeline of the process. 
 But why isn’t Convergence continuing to run as an independent firm? Adrian Li, its managing partner, says the new entity can pool resources to better help startups. He will hold the same title at AC Ventures. 
 In December 2018,  DealStreetAsia  reported that Convergence was in the process of raising its second fund. However, Li says the report isn’t accurate and that the firm will not raise a new fund after the merger. 
 According to Li, the internal rate of return of Convergence’s first fund, which is now in its fifth year, is above 30%. 
  See:  Which are the top-performing VC funds in Southeast Asia?   
 After the merger, the limited partners of both Agaeti and Convergence will remain the note holders in the companies that they have invested in, Soerijadji explains. However, he says there is a possibility for AC Ventures to invest in its past portfolios. 
 “We have inside information [from the companies that we invested in],” Soerijadji says. “It gives us an advantage. When it makes sense, we will invest more in them.” 
 However, because AC Ventures focuses on early-stage startups, Li says that most of Convergence’s portfolio companies may already be out of the new entity’s scope. 
 For Agaeti, Indonesia’s tech ecosystem is a compelling opportunity due to the country’s growing population and favorable economy, Soerijadji says. 
 Despite this, technology adoption in the country is still behind other developed countries. 
  See:  Indonesia’s stunning growth doesn’t tell the full story   
 “We believe every country [including Indonesia] will adapt to technology more and more. That’s the idea,” says Soerijadji. 
 When it comes to finding a promising startup, Sjahrir says he wants to focus on whether the founders have the right set of characteristics and whether the business makes sense. Times of crisis, like the Covid-19 pandemic, he says, is a good opportunity to exercise whether a founder is capable or not. 
 “I want to see three characters from the founders: grit, humility, and how they set the team,” says Sjahrir. ",Aditya Hadi Pratama,0,4,"[(0, 0.9998377)]","['edtech', 'fintech', 'Gojek', 'digital', 'healthtech', 'Sjahrir', 'SoftBank']","['VC', 'Soerijadji', 'Sea', 'Luhut', 'Indonesia']"

 Now, Bengaluru-based  Swiggy  has announced that it has raised US$43 million as part of its series I fundraise, bringing the size of the round to US$156 million. 
 Existing investor Tencent, as well as new investors Ark Impact, Korea Investment Partners, Samsung Ventures, and Mirae Asset Capital Markets participated in the latest top-up, a spokesperson for Swiggy told  Tech in Asia.

 The development marks the food delivery startup’s second major raise this year. In February, it secured  US$113 million  in series I money in a round led by Prosus Ventures. China’s Meituan Dianping and US-based Wellington Management Company also chipped in. 
 The startup previously said it will use the funds to expand into new lines of business, including cloud kitchens and new categories for its on-demand services. 
 Swiggy rival  Zomato  has also been arming itself with capital, bagging  US$150 million  earlier in January from Jack Ma’s Ant Financial. 
 After less than two weeks, it announced it had  acquired Uber Eats  in India, increasing its reach. According to a  Bloomberg  report, the deal could see Zomato hitting monthly food orders of up to 50 million, up from its usual 40 million. 
 Most recently, the restaurant discovery app reportedly secured  US$5 million  from UK-based Pacific Horizon Investment Trust, a fund managed by investment management firm Baillie Gifford. Its valuation is said to have reached US$3.3 billion, close to Swiggy’s US$3.6 billion. 
 Both Zomato and Swiggy have also recently ventured into online grocery delivery as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to cut down demand for food deliveries. 
 While Swiggy has already been delivering daily essentials through Swiggy Stores and Swiggy Go, it has partnered with retail grocery stores this time to enable deliveries in most cities it operates in. 
 On the other hand, Zomato has recently rolled out its own grocery delivery service called Zomato Market, partnering with FMCG firm Marico for essential supplies. Marico is also a partner of Swiggy.

 Launched in 2015, PayMaya is an e-wallet that enables users to receive money, send remittances, pay bills, and make online payments. It also provides government units with digital payments and disbursement services. 
 “In line with the country’s goals, we have made significant strides in spurring cashless adoption in a largely unbanked population,” said Orlando Vea, the founder and CEO of Voyager. “This funding boosts PayMaya’s ability to reach more Filipinos, especially as access to digital financial services becomes even more important.” 
  See:  E-wallets are starting to take off in the Philippines. Here are the key players   
 In the Philippines, PayMaya competes with GCash, the e-wallet service offered by PLDT rival Globe Telecom. PayMaya and GCash are part of a proxy war between Tencent and Alibaba, with the latter backing GCash through its parent, Mynt, in 2017. 
 Other players in the space include Coins.ph, which was acquired by Indonesian unicorn Gojek, and GrabPay by Singapore ride-hailing giant Grab. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(3, 0.999565)]","['IFC', 'PLDT', 'GCash', 'Mynt', 'GrabPay', 'KKR']","['Singapore', 'Manila', 'Philippines', 'PayMaya', 'China']"
644079,Same-day delivery startup RaRa Delivery gets seed money in 500 Startups-led round," Customers are increasingly looking for faster delivery options as ecommerce continues to grow. In Indonesia, the gross merchandise volume is expected to reach around US$97 billion by 2025, with the logistics of physical goods reaching US$5 billion in revenue, said  RaRa Delivery . 
 RaRa is an Indonesian logistics startup that wants to make same-day delivery scalable. It announced today the closure of its seed funding round at S$1.2 million or more than US$830,000, led by 500 Startups. A syndicate of angel investors from Southeast Asia-focused Angel Central led by Der Shing Lim also participated in the round.

 The company said it will use the new funds to acquire talent in business development, operations, and technology to further expand in Indonesia, Karan Bhardwaj, founder and CEO of RaRa, said. 
 Founded in 2017, RaRa provides last-mile logistics services for ecommerce businesses across Greater Jakarta by leveraging its asset-light model and real-time optimization technology. 
 RaRa’s algorithms can create routes for “thousands of orders in a matter of seconds” by doing capacity optimization that factors in weight, dimensions, parcel type, and distance based on sub-districts and route optimization based on real-time traffic data, Bhardwaj told  Tech in Asia . 
 Other service providers trying to do same-day deliveries do so through point-to-point deliveries, which lack consolidation and optimization and charge as much as US$3.50 for a distance of 25 kilometers, said Bhardwaj. “The price is not sustainable for ecommerce businesses, merchants, or sellers,” he said. 
 RaRa charges a flat rate regardless of distance. “We want to find the perfect balance between customer service and cost,” Bhardwaj said. 
 Aside from its alogrithms, the startup also offers integration of its open application programming interfaces. 
 RaRa said it currently does deliveries for the likes of Lazada, Shopee, and Bukalapak, among others. 
 Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Bhardwaj admits that his company has also been affected. However, RaRa continues to deliver groceries and other essentials for partners like Mitra Bukalapak and Gorry Gourmet. It is also looking to partner with more businesses that require urgent deliveries for essentials, Bhardwaj said. 
 Last year, the startup secured angel funding from GK-Plug and Play Indonesia, Zopim co-founders Royston Tay and Yang Bin Kwok, Stripe’s Vidit Agarwal, as well as Unilever exec Vishal Gupta.

644096,How a Singaporean became a billionaire by selling microchips," Swee Ann Teo is a Singaporean geek with a restless streak. 
 Coming from a middle-class family, he owned an old Apple II – one of the world’s first mainstream personal computers. 
 As an eight-year-old in the 1980s, he obsessed over its  Z-80 mircroprocessor  and wrote his first program on the machine until it broke down. 
 “That experience led me to understand that I loved building things,” he told  Tech in Asia  in an exclusive email interview. 
   
 Today, that lifelong obsession has turned the 45-year-old into a billionaire. Like Wong Hoo Sim, the Singaporean who made a fortune by inventing the Sound Blaster sound card, Teo is in the hardware business. 
 But unlike Sim, who shuttled between Silicon Valley and Singapore, he’s been plying his trade in China. 
 Betting his chips 
 Teo’s Shanghai-headquartered company,  Espressif Systems , is a leader in wireless- and bluetooth-enabled “systems on a chip” – essentially computers that are the size of a coin. “We sell chips and modules. That’s it,” he said. 
 These chips, which first took off among hobbyist hardware hackers, serve a grand goal. They can turn any dumb device into smart gadgets – think speakers, light bulbs, and switches that can be controlled using mobile phones. 
 By betting on the internet of things – a trend of interconnected computers being embedded into the objects people use everyday – and serving a passionate community well, Espressif has transformed into a company that’s worth over US$2 billion (on a  well-above-the-norm  price-to-earnings ratio of around 100), with Teo owning about 44% of it. 
 Unlike many tech unicorns these days, Espressif is both growing and profitable. It has kept its sales and marketing costs down by relying on word-of-mouth and online distribution. 
   
 Before getting into the startup game, Teo seemed set for a comfortable corporate career. After studying at Hwa Chong Junior College, a top institution in Singapore, he graduated with an engineering degree from the National University of Singapore in 1999. 
 But he didn’t tread a well-worn path. Teo would skip classes to practice classical guitar for 10 hours a day, though he studied just enough to maintain decent grades. 
 “I was probably a difficult kid because I was stubborn,” he admitted. “I was fortunate that the school had been lenient on me.” 
 As the internet bubble burst in 2000, Teo landed a role at a US startup where he helped design bluetooth chips. 
 But being bored at his second job in the US, he moved to China in 2004 – when the country’s tech industry was still in its infancy – to help a company develop electrical components for digital televisions. 
 “I was looking for a challenge and some adventure,” he said. 
 In the wilderness for seven years 
 Teo felt the itch to start something innovative. He saw that many startups in China were undercutting one another by developing identical products such as bluetooth and radio technologies as well as digital televisions. 
 At the same time, he observed that a new paradigm was emerging: As computers become more powerful, software could make chip design more automated. 
 “There are very advanced tools today that use AI to design chips that outperform those created by the more traditional methods,” he added. 
 So he thought: Why not design software to create chips? 
 Espressif was founded in 2007 to do just that. According to Teo, those were lean times – the firm had to go through two phases before finding its sweet spot, and the founder spent two years without paying himself a salary. 
   
 It turned out that getting people to learn new and complicated software was harder than he thought. 
 So Espressif became a chip design consultancy firm instead. While the business was profitable and made good money from helping clients build electrical components, Teo remained unsatisfied because he felt such a company wouldn’t scale fast and would remain behind the technological curve. 
 “So I decided that we should design some chips,” he recalled. The startup raised its first round of funding in 2013, just as it was about to put its landmark product, the ESP8266 chip, into production. 
 Taking the hobbyist world by storm 
 Espressif sought to squeeze Wi-Fi and computing components into a single chip that could be sold at an affordable price. 
 Doubters thought the goal was impractical, but Teo saw it as a mere design challenge. “We just worked out the physics of it,” he said. 
 The chip became the talk of the town, first among hobbyist hardware tinkerers in China, then around the world. Its emergence was “shocking news” that “thundered across the electronics blogosphere,”  according  to Brian Benchoff, a writer for American blog site  Hack a Day . 
 “Yes, for five dollars you can blink a LED from the internet,” he  wrote . 
 Design prowess, however, was not the only reason for its success.

 As those in the US tested this powerful new chip, they found a catch: All the documentation for it was in Chinese. 
 The hacker community  rallied together  to translate the instructions and figure out how to program the chip, and Espressif set up an official English forum for the product, which filled up with a wealth of information within a week. 
 The company has embraced software again. But instead of selling it to customers, it has released open-source platforms that help people create projects with its chips. 
 As a firm run by and built for tinkerers, the community is turning out to be a defensive moat. 
 “The real advantage of the ESP8266 is its raw popularity,”  notes  a person on popular technology forum Hacker News. 
 This means that even though competitive chips from competitors like semiconductor giant RealTek have come out, developing on the ESP8266, even for commercial products, could be easier due to the amount of community support and resources available. 
 Even as the startup struck gold and scaled up, it has retained its geekiness at its core. 
 “Technical discussions form the core of life in Espressif,” said Teo. Although he holds the CEO title, he spends most of his time on technology. 
 Still, he’s had to broaden his horizons. “I need to learn some of the stuff that I have no interest in, or I should at least cultivate an interest in things that matter. As a CEO, you are responsible for everything,” he added. 
 Ringing the bell 
 While Espressif was well-known among the DIY community, its prominence among the wider world grew once it rang the bell for its public listing on the Star Market, China’s Nasdaq-like tech board, in July 2019. 
 The company even has a  fan in Vivian Balakrishnan , Singapore’s minister for foreign affairs and a self-professed tech geek.

 While the Star Market has  dimmed  since it began – overall trading volume and stock prices of many of its listed companies have fallen – Espressif is an exception: It’s trading at about 40% above the opening price. 
 While it maintains loyalty among hobbyists, the company has made inroads into supplying chips to commercial appliance makers. 
 Since its launch, Espressif has shipped  100 million chips  to companies, including manufacturers of surveillance cameras, robots, sensor networks, and consumer devices. 
 Still, the firm has a long road ahead. As a new entrant, it’s going up against well-established suppliers who’ve had long-standing relationships with consumer brands. 
 Teo believes his company can ride on the growing internet-of-things industry, which is expected to  expand  in the coming years. 
 “Speech recognition will become a standard feature in consumer electronics from this year onwards,” he said. 
 While Teo believes Covid-19 will impact his firm, it hasn’t shown in the company’s numbers yet. 
 “We are betting that a cure would most probably be found by the end of 2020,” he said. 
 Right now, his company is doubling down on what it does best: R&amp;D. It aims to launch four new chips this year. 
 Look to China, not Southeast Asia 
 With Espressif reaching maturity as a company, Teo now hopes to spend more time contributing back to Singapore’s startup community. 
 His main advice to founders? Don’t be afraid of entering China. 
 “Many entrepreneurs think it would be difficult to compete against Chinese players and hence should not engage in this market,” he added. “I believe this is a big mistake.” 
 With China set to dominate this decade alongside the US, startups should build products that can take off in these countries. 
 “If we do not have a compelling product for the two largest economies of the world, we probably don’t have a compelling product for the rest of the world,” he said.

 And while China has received a reputation for producing copycat products, Teo thinks it’s a fallacy. 
 Even though the country is a “perfect model of utilitarianism” with a strong emphasis on efficiency and cost, he believes cost controls are a product of innovation. Teo also cited Tencent’s WeChat as an example of Chinese innovation and long-term thinking at its best. 
 “We can look at how Tencent’s QQ has given birth to WeChat. Tencent has reined in the baser instincts of competing with its partners,” he said. Instead, the Chinese giant’s working with them to build a diverse WeChat ecosystem. 
 Southeast Asia is likely to bear fruit only in the distant future. 
 While many Singaporean startups –  and even Chinese startups  – see Southeast Asia as a growth opportunity, Teo has a different view. 
 “A focus on Southeast Asia is likely to bear fruit only in the distant future,” he said, noting that businesses thrive when there’s “a stable government with a clear mandate to bring about stability and growth. 
 “In a nutshell, China is an excellent target for Singaporean entrepreneurs,” he said. ",Terence Lee,0,8,"[(0, 0.019231953), (1, 0.046437237), (2, 0.93430626)]","['Espressif', 'DIY']","['US', 'Singapore', 'Shanghai', 'Asia', 'RealTek', 'China']"

643868,Love is in the air amid Covid-19 ❤️," Dear Readers, 
 As our chief operating officer Maria Li recently put it, Southeast  Asia’s startup ecosystem  is  full of heart . And as the world continues to reel from the continued spread of Covid-19, there are efforts springing up within the community to make things a little better. 
 Positive vibes 
 One of them is the  #SupportStartup  initiative by Openspace, 500 Startups, and Cocoon Capital. It brings together all the startup promotions in one page so you can support businesses via your wallet. Do check it out. 
 There’s also an  ongoing crowdfunding campaign  led by East Ventures. The goal is to develop test kits and genetic testings to fight the pandemic in Indonesia. 
 Meanwhile, Saison Capital, FutureLabs, Convergence, and more are helping individuals who were let go to quickly  find new opportunities . If you’re reading this and have been affected by layoffs, you can also use our  jobs platform . 
 Last but not least, TNB Aura just announced that they’re inviting startups disrupted by Covid-19 (that’s mostly everyone, right?) to  apply for funding  under their Special Situations Fund. 
 We’re all suffering and it’s OK 
 Covid-19 has upended our community and the whole world. 
 And you know what? It’s really OK. 
 For the vast majority of  companies that aren’t Zoom , it’s perfectly normal to see revenue and user growth tank. As founders, the last thing you want to do is to put up a false front – internally or externally – and pretend that your startup isn’t affected. 
 In recent times, I’ve received notes from people questioning the intention of our reports, from trend pieces such as Covid-19’s  impact on businesses  to breaking news about  job cuts . We were told not to be “heartless.” We were told not to throw the community under the bus. We were told to only be cheerleaders, not detractors. 
 These criticisms aren’t new, and we’re doing what we’ve always done:  reporting what’s happening on the ground. Covid-19 will not change that fact. You read  Tech in Asia  to get the breadth and depth of what’s  really  happening in the region’s tech community. And we’re doing our best to deliver exactly that. 
 However, we do understand that it is only normal that no one wants to look bad in the media. The newsroom has no intention to make anyone look bad – or good, for that matter. Simply put, we are just truth tellers. As we poke sources and dig up facts, we constantly remind our reporters to stay empathetic during the process. We aim to be tough but fair. 
 For instance, one of our reporters once went to a startup to get line-by-line comments on leaked financial information we received. The founder was annoyed by the whole process (understandably so) and we published the story, anyway. While it wasn’t his favorite experience, he eventually realized that we were fair to him. We even got a scoop from him after that experience. 
 By sharing this, I hope you understand our work a little bit better. As a business publication, we don’t see the point of printing only positive news and good vibes. Our stories should reflect the real situation we are all facing. 
 It’s not looking very rosy now, but this too shall pass. And remember:  Every crisis presents opportunities . 
 Stay optimistic! 💪

 Called  AC Ventures , the new entity will continue the prior funds’ respective strategies of investing in early-stage, Indonesia-focused tech opportunities, according to a statement. In particular, it will back companies in areas such as ecommerce, digital content, and fintech, as well as those serving micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. 
 It aims to invest in up to 35 startups in Indonesia over the next three years. 
 AC Ventures was formally established in the third quarter of 2019 and has since then completed several investments, the company said. Its partners include Adrian Li and Donald Wihardja from Convergence, Michael Soerijadji from Agaeti, and Pandu Sjahrir from Indies Capital. 
 Agaeti and Convergence remain separate and fully deployed, according to the statement. 
 In total, Agaeti and Convergence have made over 70 early-stage investments, including those in startups like CoHive, Fore Coffee, Moka, Xendit, and Akseleran, among others. 
 According to Soerijadji, the first wave of investments in Indonesia has accelerated the technological adoption in sectors such as online shopping, ride-hailing, and fintech. 
 “However, Indonesia is still relatively early along the adoption curve, and the next wave will continue to follow more developed markets and see disruption happen in many more traditional spaces, as well as new opportunities.” 
 AC Ventures has also launched an initiative called Leadership Talks, a series of talks that would feature local leaders sharing their guidance on how to navigate the impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak. Its first talk, scheduled for later today, will feature Gojek co-CEO Andre Soelistyo. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.9995832)]",[],"['Moka', 'Indonesia']"

 Founded in 2017, Finhay is a wealth management platform that helps users perform micro investments in mutual funds in Vietnam starting from just 50,000 dong (US$2.11). The firm previously raised a total of US$1.1 million, primarily from Australia’s H2 Ventures and Singapore’s Insignia Ventures Partners, placing it among the most well-funded fintech startups in Vietnam. 
 “In the wealth management sector in Vietnam, we are just tapping the surface of its potential,” said Finhay’s founder and CEO Nghiem Xuan Huy. “With the financial support, experience, and expertise of our new investors, we can capture this potential and accelerate our growth.” 
 Finhay said it will use the new funding to expand its market reach, optimize IT infrastructure, and recruit more staff to grow the platform. 
  Vietnam’s emerging fintech sector  
 “Finhay’s modern, tech-enabled solution is revolutionizing access to wealth management resources for millennials,” said Cruttenden, whose company last year raised US$105 million in series E funding. “With a growing need for fintech in Vietnam, Finhay’s competitive advantage is its commitment to financial literacy and emphasis on education for younger generations.” 
 As most Vietnamese focus on traditional investments such as stocks and real estate to build wealth,there is a significant demand in the country for more innovative financial services for the younger generations, offering a broader diversification of assets. 
 Similar platforms in the region include StashAway, which last year raised US$12 million in series B funding. However, Smartly, which was acquired by Vietnam’s VinaCapital Ventures in July 2019, closed last month, citing intense competition in the digital advisory space.

 Founded in 2012, BIT’s mobile-centric products include Wun Zinn, an e-book and web series platform that offers over 5,000 physical books for door-to-door delivery. It has more than 2 million users, according to the company’s website. BIT also operates Min Thein Kha, an astrologer marketplace that has over 600,000 users, the startup claims. 
 Other products include Frozen and Bagan, mobile keyboards with automatic speech recognition for the Burmese language, and BI Miner, a social listening tool that provides sentiment analysis to businesses in Myanmar. The company has also developed Therapa, a social commerce chatbot that can take inquiries, check stocks, and complete orders. 
 BIT said it will use the new funds to scale its core products and strengthen its market position as a top tech provider for the Burmese language. It also wants to double the revenues for Min Thein Kha this year, while doubling down on Wun Zinn. 
 The company claims that its astrologer marketplace has grown 7x in revenues last year, while the digital content business has grown over 2x. It also said it will invest more in content and writers, as reading continues to be a very popular activity in Myanmar. 
 BIT said its advantage comes from both its capability to develop technology and a good understanding of Myanmar’s consumers. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.9995652)]","['CTO', 'BIT', 'Frozen']","['Japan', 'Myanmar', 'Therapa']"
643931,Why are alternative protein startups like Impossible Foods scaling to China?,"  With Covid-19 plunging all aspects of decision-making and business planning into darkness, the last thing startups would have on their minds is expansion – let alone into China.   
  But that’s exactly what Impossible Foods is doing. The company, which produces plant-based substitutes for meat and dairy products, says it’s scaling into mainland China soon.  
   The country’s plant-based protein market has grown 33.5% since 2014 to US$9.7 billion in 2018, and that figure is expected to rise to US$11.9 billion by 2023, according to Euromonitor.  
  “Our Asia markets are currently Singapore, Hong Kong, and Macau, and mainland China is definitely a market that we are keen on,”   Impossible Foods senior vice president Nick Halla tells  Tech in Asia . Demand for alternative protein products in the company’s current markets has jumped sixfold in 2019, he says, adding that there was an “overwhelmingly positive response” to its first exhibit in Shanghai last November.

  Halla’s comments come after Impossible Foods closed a US$500 million series F round in March, bringing the firm’s funding to date to around US$1.3 billion. The company, along with fellow alternative protein producer Beyond Meat, has been credited with catapulting this category of food tech into the spotlight.  
  Another startup in the space is Malaysia-based  Phuture Foods . The firm, which has developed a plant-based pork substitute, is also going ahead with plans to launch its product with The 1925 Brewing Co., a Singaporean brewery, in the city-state on April 8. This, even though Singapore has imposed stricter restrictions on gatherings in F&amp;B establishments.   
  “Our partner restaurants are telling us it’s still a good time to launch,” explains its chief operating officer Jin Yin Lim. “Our logistics and manpower were all affected by Covid-19. Besides that, we’re still doing fine.”   
  Lim says that the company will be planning to raise a series A round in the later half of this year to fund its “aggressive growth plans,” which includes breaking into China and Thailand by the end of 2020. Phuture Foods will also explore tie-ups with partners in other industries, such as the hospitality sector, while also expanding its product lines to include dumplings and ready-to-eat meals.  
  But why now?  
  It seems that the pandemic has given a nudge for alternative protein (or alt-protein) startups to enter the Chinese consumer market. Even before the outbreak, demand for mock meat had been on an upward trajectory, leading to some analysts calling it  the next hip trend in the country   . The impact is also seen in the US, where  plant-based meat sales skyrocketed by 280%    amid the crisis.

  Hong Kong-based  Green Monday  is one startup that has seen “massive” growth in its retail markets in Greater China. Its CEO, David Yeung, tells  Tech in Asia  that sales of its plant-based meat products jumped 77%, as compared to figures before the outbreak. Online sales for the firm also went up by 57.3%.  
  While Yeung says its sales to F&amp;B outlets have taken a hit, he believes this is a short-term issue.  
  “We are in talks with many mega restaurant chains now, as they want to introduce something healthy and without meat [food] in their menus when they reopen,” says Yeung.  
  Existing problems  
  Amid the crisis, having a startup in the sector getting a hefty billion-dollar pat on the back can definitely be viewed as a positive, but are other alt-protein firms faring the same? Carrie Chan, the CEO and co-founder of cell-based protein provider Avant Meats, says that isn’t exactly the case.  
  Despite there already being investors interested in the space, she says companies like hers still have to be “patient for capital to roll in.”  
  “Covid-19 has affected us in the form of delays. It has been and will be hard to get face-to-face meetings with potential investors. We had to postpone several of those meetings to June and July,” she says.

  The outbreak has also put businesses in danger of running out of cash as investor appetite sours and fundraising activities slow,  SEA Founders told us recently.   
  And unlike the other startups mentioned, it may take over a year before Avant Meats can commercially launch its product. The company produces fish meat alternatives that it develops in the laboratory, but the process is expensive, costing as much as US$1,000 per kilogram.  
  Indeed, alt-meat producers need to make their product competitive, Lim says. But the industry’s ultimate rival is still the pork industry.  
  “We are aiming to be price-competitive against pork. To do so, we need to retail at less than S$10 (US$7) a kilogram, which is how much premium pork costs right now.”  
  “  The only competition we care about is meat from animals,” Halla agrees. “The animal agriculture industry is estimated to be greater than US$1.5 trillion, and therefore, our growth opportunities are enormous.”  
  Eating alternative: Better in the long term?  
  Lab-grown protein aims to replicate the taste and consistency of traditional meat. Apart from cutting out its environmental impact, many expect that the move to the petri dish will appeal particularly to people concerned about the role land-based animal agriculture has in accelerating climate change.  
  Besides the danger of disease outbreaks, modern meat production puts a strain on the planet’s resources. Animal agriculture, such as livestock rearing, cattle ranching, dairy farming, and factory farmed eggs, contributes  up to 18%    of global greenhouse gas emissions.

  So this begs the juicy question: How exactly is growing meat in a lab better for us and the environment in the long term?     
  In the case of Avant Meats, which “completely removes” the animal body in the meat production process, Chan says it minimizes the significant loss of resources like the space and water needed to rear fish.  
  “This also helps consumers totally avoid environmental contaminants in the food supply chain due to the crowded and usually unhygienic living environment of tame animals,” she says.   
  For Impossible Foods, Halla notes that in 2019, consumers in Singapore saved “more than 3.8 million square meters of land” from being destroyed to produce beef by choosing to buy Impossible Foods products instead of animal meats.   
  “That’s more than three times the size of Singapore’s landmark, Gardens by the Bay,” he concludes.  ",Joseph Gan,0,5,"[(0, 0.92772883), (1, 0.016960578), (3, 0.055269703)]","['Foods', 'Halla', 'Yeung']","['US', 'Singapore', 'Shanghai', 'Asia', 'Macau', 'Gardens', 'Malaysia', 'Thailand', 'China']"
643962,Enterprise fintech firm Recko banks $6m in Vertex-led round," Bengaluru-based  Recko , a startup that enables AI-powered reconciliation of digital transactions, said it has raised US$6 million in a series A funding round led by Vertex Ventures SEA and India. 
 The round also saw participation from existing investor Prime Venture Partners, according to a statement. The early-stage VC firm first invested in Recko in June last year with  US$1 million  in seed funding.

 Founded in 2017, Recko offers a software-as-a-service product that helps organizations keep track of complete transaction life cycles and commercial contracts. It automates the reconciliation process and allows data to be traced by getting connected to payment gateways, banks, and merchants’ order management systems. 
 Recko said it now looks to invest further into product development and bolster its leadership team. It also plans to expand its presence outside of India, with a goal of reconciling transactions worth US$10 billion by the end of the year. It claims to have reconciled transactions worth US$5 billion to date since it launched. 
 Citing an Assocham-PwC study, Recko said that India is currently experiencing a rise in online transactions. Digital payments in the country are expected to more than double to US$135.2 billion in 2023 from US$64.8 billion in 2019. 
 “Transaction reconciliation is not a new problem, but the nature and extent of this problem has changed due to rapid digitization of transactions […],” said Recko co-founder and CEO Prakash Sinha. “Right now, it is a great time for companies to put systems in place to get ready for the growth when the markets open up.” 
 Recko’s clients include online grocer Grofers, social commerce platform Meesho, and delivery firm Dunzo. It said it has also started working with various financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies in the country.

643957,Luckin Coffee shares dive as probe into alleged $310m fraud starts," Nasdaq-listed Luckin Coffee’s share price fell 75.57% to US$6.40 as of market close on Thursday, after the company submitted a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announcing an internal investigation into the conduct of former chief operating officer Jian Liu, who is believed to have inflated revenues by 2.2 billion yuan (US$310.5 million).

 Luckin also stipulated that law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis will provide independent counsel during the investigation, and advised investors to disregard financial results and guidance from 2019 until the full extent of misconduct can be identified. 
 The now-suspended Jian Liu served as Luckin’s COO since May 2018, having previously worked with CEO Qian Zhiya at Car Inc. from 2008 to 2017. 
 On January 31, questions about the legitimacy of Luckin’s financial results were first raised by diligence-based equity research firm Muddy Waters, which revealed their short position on Luckin via Twitter, citing an 89-page anonymous report supported by 11,260 hours of store traffic video footage. The specific reference to tracking in-store video suggested the embellishment of sales. 
 Just days later on February 3, Xiamen-based Luckin responded to the short attack, refuting the “misleading and false allegations” in another SEC filing,  KrAsia  reported. At the time, the on-demand beverage startup claimed that all of its “key operating data, including the number of items per store per day, items per order, and effective selling price, are tracked in real time and could be verified.” 
 About a month later on March 6, 10 US law firms announced they were prepared to file a lawsuit against Luckin on behalf of investors. Specifically, these American investigators were looking into the potential fabrication of certain financial and operating metrics, including per-store per-day sales, net selling price per item, and advertising expenses. 
 Luckin has performed well since its initial public offering that raised US$645 million in May 2019, climbing from an opening price of just over US$20 to a peak of around US$50 in January. The fallout from Thursday’s announcement erased what was a 54% gain since IPO, slashing the company’s market cap by almost US$5 billion. 
 Despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Luckin’s 2020 outlook was positive, as analysts had expected a 170% year-on-year increase in sales before news of the investigation broke. In addition, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, 33 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in Luckin, an increase of 43% from the previous quarter. 
 Luckin chief financial officer Reinout Schakel said in an interview last November that the company is on track to become profitable by the third quarter of 2020. 
 The company has established the largest network of coffee stores in China as of the end of 2019, surpassing industry incumbent Starbucks. However, it might take some time for Luckin’s management to repair their credibility in the eyes of investors.

 Startups may propose solutions in the following areas: 
 
 Mitigation (e.g., masks, contact tracing, surveillance, data infrastructure) 
 Medical equipment (e.g., test kits, protective devices, ventilators) 
 Remote health (e.g., telehealth, remote patient monitoring, symptom checkers) 
 Digital tools (e.g., remote work, smart delivery, e-learning) 
 
 According to a statement, selected teams will be invited to a video pitch session. Finalists will then remotely present to the firm’s investment committee, who will evaluate startups based on the solutions’ relevance in mitigating the disease and how the startup could work after the outbreak. 
 “Great necessity inspires great innovation. As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to disrupt human life around the world, now is a time when innovators need to come together for the greater good,” Magnus Grimeland, the founder and CEO of Antler, said. 
 Interested teams can apply via  this website  until April 15. 
 Separately, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) has also announced an initiative for gig workers in Asia Pacific who are also affected by the uncertainties brought by the pandemic. 
 Through its  Gig Economy Challenge , the organization is offering technical assistance worth US$100,000 and seed funding of up to US$30,000 to help pilot solutions that seek to improve the financial health of gig workers in Malaysia. 
 UNCDF is rolling out the initiative with MetLife Foundation, APEC 2020, Bank Negara Malaysia, and Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(0, 0.7419874), (1, 0.055312227), (2, 0.20256504)]","['Antler', 'Bank', 'APEC', 'UNCDF', 'Digital']","['Singapore', 'Malaysia']"
643912,Furniture rental startup Furlenco banks $10m," Bengaluru-based  Furlenco , a startup that offers a home furniture rental service, said it has raised US$10 million in debt and equity from new and existing investors. 
 Backers in the round included family offices, former CEOs, ultra high-net-worth individuals, as well as institutions such as Vivriti Capital, according to a statement. Local media reported venture capital firm Lightbox and bollywood star Aamir Khan also invested.

 Furlenco was founded in 2011 by former Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley executive Ajith Mohan Karimpana. It offers a subscription service for a range of curated home furniture. 
 Karimpana told  Tech in Asia  that Furlenco plans to use the new funds to extend its runway “as far as possible,” looking toward sustainable growth. The chief exec also said that while the company is already operationally profitable, Furlenco aims to become fully profitable in the next 12 to 18 months. 
 Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Karimpana said that Furlenco’s business model and monthly recurring revenue has allowed it to stay afloat. 
 “However, the times are tough and uncertain,” he said. “We look forward to some specific announcement from the government around supporting the startup community with a dedicated financial package for revival.” 
 India has been placed on lockdown last week, forcing several businesses to suspend operations. 
 To date, Furlenco has raised an estimated US$43 million in equity funding and roughly US$45 million through debt deals. It has paid off about US$20 million of that debt so far, according to an  Economic Times  report. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(2, 0.99931824)]",['Furlenco'],"['Asia', 'Lightbox', 'India']"
643919,Bounce’s founders give up salary to keep team intact amid Covid-19," Indian scooter-sharing startup  Bounce  announced company-wide salary cuts to keep the business afloat in light of the Covid-19 crisis. 
 The startup’s three founders – Vivekananda Hallekere, Varun Agni, and Anil Giriraj – will all be taking a 100% pay cut. The rest of the employees have agreed to a 20% to 60% pay cut in exchange for employee stock ownership plans. 
 “Taking these pay cuts across the company ensures that no jobs are lost […] and the company improves its runway to over 30 months,” Bounce said in a statement.

 The company said the move was part of its business continuity plan, as it expects the pandemic to slow down the investment scenario and affect operational cash flow. It aims to conserve cash while keeping its team intact. 
 “The underlying idea behind this decision is that everyone in the organization takes the impact equally and not direct it at a few,” the company said. “Bounce aims to withstand these tough times together, with all its employees.” 
 The firm looks to reinstate the original salary and pay due compensation as soon as things get back to normal. 
 The startup is rather well-funded. Last month, it raised  US$6.5 million  from InnoVen Capital. In January, it bagged  US$105 million  in a series D funding round led by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin’s B Capital Group and Accel. The round reportedly gave Bounce a valuation of US$520 million. 
 As the outbreak persists, other startups in the region have also made similar measures. Indonesia’s Gojek said its co-CEOs and senior management would donate  25%  of their annual salary to support its drivers, merchants, and other partners. Grab’s senior leaders, meanwhile, will take a pay cut of up to  20% . 
 India’s Zomato has earlier announced that its employees have voluntarily taken  deep salary cuts  to help conserve the company’s cash flow.

643863,Singapore B2B e-learning platform raises funds in Agaeti-led round,"  ProSpark , a Singapore-based e-learning platform for businesses, announced that it has closed a pre-seed funding round led by early-stage venture capital firm Agaeti Ventures. 
 Angel investor Adi Adisaputro and Prasetia Dwidharma, a telecom infrastructure developer and early-stage investment firm, also participated in the round. 
 The amount of funding was not disclosed.

 Founded in 2018, ProSpark provides a business-to-business learning management system that allows employees to access individual or group trainings online. To engage and motivate learners, it gamifies the system with leadership boards, badges, and a points system. 
 ProSpark also lets companies onboard, train, and certify their employees. It also enables conduct knowledge transfer and collaboration. 
 The startup will use the new funds to expand its tech infrastructure and reach more industries in its main market of Indonesia. Its target priority sectors are currently banking and insurance. 
 The company also has plans to expand into new markets in Southeast Asia in the future. 
 “The Southeast Asian market is a proven fertile ground for digital transformation. The B2B space is ready, as we’re seeing companies starting to invest more in modernizing their training ecosystems,” said Pandu Sjahrir, a general partner at Agaeti Ventures. 
 ProSpark currently has 22 employees, with tech teams in Indonesia and the Philippines. 
 With the Covid-19 outbreak forcing people to stay at home, many e-learning companies are seeing an uptick in demand. ProSpark said it is also experiencing a surge in usage, without giving specific numbers. 
 “Right now, with the [coronavirus] issue, many in-person trainings have been cancelled, and companies have been looking for cheaper and more efficient ways to train people,” Alfa Bumhira, the CEO and co-founder of ProSpark, said. He added that although his company is seeing an increase in usage now, “I believe post-crisis, the demand for e-learning in both industries and institutions is going to be massive.” 
 Even before the pandemic, the global corporate e-learning sector is already expected to grow to  US$30 billion  by 2022 at a 13% compound annual growth rate. Asia Pacific could witness the fastest growth in the market, according to a report.

643893,SoftBank backs out of $3b WeWork tender offer,"  SoftBank  is abandoning its commitment to spend US$3 billion to acquire  WeWork  stock from the co-working operator’s former CEO Adam Neumann and other shareholders. 
 
  Photo credit: moovstock / 123RF 
 
 In an emailed statement to  Japan Times , the special committee of WeWork’s board said that they have been told by SoftBank that it will not be moving forward with the tender offer agreed upon back in October last year. The committee noted that they will remain committed to reaching a resolution. 
 “The special committee will evaluate all of its legal options, including litigation,” they added. 
 WeWork declined to comment further on the matter. 
 Last month, WeWork shareholders received a letter saying the investment giant  may not complete  its tender offer, which is part of its rescue package for the embattled startup, partly due to regulatory probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. 
 In response, the special committee said March 22 that they may take  necessary actions  to ensure that the tender offer stands. 
 “Not only is SoftBank obligated to consummate the tender offer […] but its excuses for not trying to close are inappropriate and dishonest,” the company said. SoftBank’s cancellation would also be “completely unethical,” WeWork said, given the current economic environment affected by Covid-19. 
 SoftBank promised the tender offer as part of its US$9.5 billion bailout program for the co-working space provider, which came after the startup’s failed IPO attempt. It also includes a US$1.5 billion injection from the Japanese conglomerate and US$5 billion in debt financing. 
 With the US$3 billion deal, SoftBank was expected to take about 80% of WeWork’s stake. Neumann was set to sell up to US$970 million of his shares, with VC firm Benchmark looking to let go of about US$600 million in shares.

643883,Lending startup Fairbanc gets Sampoerna backing for Indonesia push,"  Fairbanc , a San Francisco-based fintech startup, announced it has raised an undisclosed amount of funding from 500 Startups and Indonesian billionaire Michael Sampoerna. 
 Sampoerna is the CEO of Sampoerna Strategic, an investment company with interests in agriculture, property, telecommunications, and finance, among others. 
 With the new investment, Fairbanc plans to make a bigger push into Indonesia, which hosts the fourth-largest unbanked population globally. According to the World Bank, the country has about  95 million adults  who don’t have a formal account at a financial institution. 
 
  Fairbanc founder Mir Haque / Photo credit: Fairbanc 
 
 Fairbanc, launched in 2018, is taking on the opportunity with its AI-powered mobile loan and payments platform designed for small and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets. It offers credit to unbanked merchants so they can buy products from large consumer brands. 
 The startup says the service doesn’t require collateral, credit history, smartphone ownership, or digital literacy. Instead, credit can be accessed through a one-time passcode sent to merchants via a text message. 
 “The speed and size of the micromerchant transactions make it challenging for banks to service this segment because their transactions tend to be small and largely not traced,” Khailee Ng, the managing partner of 500 Startups, said. 
 Fairbanc relies on data science and machine learning to automate credit scoring and risk monitoring, allowing it to provide loans instantly, according to a statement. 
 After completing the initial test of its service in Bangladesh in 2018, the company rolled out the platform with Unilever Indonesia through startup program Unilever Foundry. It claims that participating outlets saw a 35% growth in sales through the program. 
 A Shariah-compliant lender, Fairbanc has also signed a partnership with a large Indonesian Islamic organization to offer Shariah financing to its 100 million members, the statement said. It has partnered with Indonesian conglomerate Sinar Mas to extend credit to micromerchants that sell Unilever products and other fast-moving consumer goods as well. 
 Fairbanc was founded by Mir Haque, who previously worked at big companies such as McKinsey &amp; Company, Deutsche Bank, and Adobe. The startup’s chief technology officer, Kevin O’Brien, held the same position at US microcredit firm Kiva. The founding team also includes Thomas Shumacher, the co-founder of California-based microlending company Tala, which also focuses on emerging markets.

643792,SoftBank’s Vision Fund has put itself in a tight spot," Created by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, the Vision Fund has had a strong reputation for investing in a variety of enterprises. It counts a bunch of well-known investments in its portfolio, including organizations such as Flipkart, Tokopedia, and WeWork. 
 
  Photo credit: moovstock / 123RF 
 
 The Vision Fund has been especially influential in bringing international awareness to many Asian-based startups. However, despite its best efforts, it’s ultimately on a declining trajectory, primarily due to three factors: a poor holistic track record, a lack of diversity in holdings, as well as a certain eccentricity in investing logic. 
 A glimmer of brilliance 
 The Vision Fund’s efforts have netted several successes, putting immense amounts of money behind early-, mid-, and late-stage startups. In fact, many of its parent company’s wins in the past several years have come directly from Vision Fund investments. 
 For example, in 2018, SoftBank experienced  an operating profit of 49%  in the first quarter due to the sale of its stake in the Indian ecommerce giant Flipkart. This shows how some of the Vision Fund’s decisions have proved profitable for SoftBank as a whole. 
 A poor track record 
 However, a quick examination of other Vision Fund holdings paints a far different picture. 
 Few of the fund’s many investments have actually proved profitable. Uber’s initial public offering in May 2019 started at US$45 per share,  falling 8%  on its first day. The ride-hailing company is currently trending around US$37 per share. 
 Slack Technologies’ June 2019 IPO listing price sat at US$38.50 a share, with its first earnings report as a public company showcasing  mixed results . Slack has since experienced a 40% decrease in stock price. 
 Similarly, WeWork’s own IPO has been delayed since  its announcement  in April 2019, with potential investors voicing significant concerns about profitability and the firm’s co-founder, Adam Neumann. That same year, SoftBank took direct control of WeWork, and the co-working startup  laid off some 2,400 employees . 
 Early 2020 has so far seen the  resignation of three WeWork board members , with sources saying a fourth board member’s departure is imminent. 
 To add to this, Brandless, another Vision Fund portfolio company that had raised over US$290 million,  shut down  in February this year. 
 Lack of diversity in holdings 
 The Vision Fund’s high-profile investments represent just a small portion of its total deals. According to  a  Bloomberg  report , “Fifty percent of the Vision Fund’s holdings are in transportation logistics and real estate.” 
 The emphasis on these two sectors can be seen in its  US$1 billion  funding round for logistics provider Flexport, in addition to a combined  US$60 billion  investment into more than 40 transportation logistics companies. And that’s not to mention its now infamous  US$7.5 billion  investment in WeWork. 
 While it’s no question that the transportation logistics and real estate industries are  experiencing growth , investing heavily in these spaces means there’s a lack of diversification, which is simply bad practice in reducing market risk. 
 With a fourth of its assets prone to volatility emerging from some transportation snafu and another fourth tied up in real estate holdings, the Vision Fund simply has no room to truly grow and prosper. In addition, this lack of diversification pairs poorly with its less-than-stellar track record. 
 Controversial investing logic 
 The Vision Fund’s investing practices have been controversial for some, with a  heavy reliance on the whims  of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son. In fact, some argue that the sizes of Son’s investments are mainly  personality-driven . 
 Case in point: The fund invested such a large sum into WeWork even if it’s primarily a loss-making company. The co-working space provider lost roughly US$219,000 every hour each day during the 12 months leading up to March, according to the   Financial Times  . 
 Historically, the Vision Fund also invests in competing businesses – it has backed Uber, Grab, Indian cab aggregator Ola, and China’s Didi Chuxing, for instance. This investing practice has  a huge potential for problems , including questions about unfair competition, conflicts of interest, information sharing, and even the success of one company at the expense of another. 
 For instance, its portfolio companies Didi Chuxing, Uber, and Rappi, a Colombia-headquartered on-demand delivery startup, are locked in  a price war  in Latin America. Uber and DoorDash – another Vision Fund investment – have also  gone head to head  in the US. 
 Though it’s worth noting that the Vision Fund isn’t the only entity doing this. Sequoia has backed Didi and Uber, while payments giant  Visa backs both Grab and Gojek . 
 The Vision Fund’s subpar track record, combined with a significant lack of diversity and controversial investing strategies have put it in a tight spot. Recent  high-profile departures  from the fund also raise questions on its sustainability. To date, three of its managing partners – David Thevenon, Praveen Akkiraju, Michael Ronen – have all left. 
 It will be interesting to see how the Vision Fund plans to turn things around. ",Hugh Harsono,0,4,"[(2, 0.08083572), (3, 0.9190745)]","['Slack', 'Tokopedia', 'Visa', 'WeWork', 'Flipkart', 'SoftBank']","['Flexport', 'Colombia', 'China', 'US']"
643850,Myanmar travel startup lays off staff as bookings drop," Myanmar-based domestic travel startup  Flymya  laid off a third of its approximately 200-strong headcount, says CEO Jeff Pan. The move happened prior to reports on March 23 that  the country had confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 . 
 “With 95% certainty, we knew that the market was going to bottom out very quickly so we took a very long-term view of the situation,” Pan told  Tech in Asia . Business conditions were already challenging before the pandemic hit Myanmar, with airlines  seeking bailouts  and  travel companies slashing jobs , he added. 
 His predictions have proven to be accurate. Flymya, which serves travelers from all over the world who are headed to Myanmar, saw its bookings drop as international commercial flight routes and popular local destinations closed. 
 Before the pandemic broke out, the company was projected to bring in US$30 million in annual booking revenue with a two-year burn rate. While it had achieved its target for the first quarter of 2020, the company now expects that number to plunge by as much as 90% in Q2. After taking into account the recent job cut, which reduced payroll costs by about 20%, Pan says Flymya will be able to maintain its burn rate. 
 “You have to prepare for the worst-case scenario,” says Pan. “We fully expect to come out of this, reset, and we’ll be sort of back to where we started.” 
 In order for Flymya to weather this challenging business environment, Pan adds that it can’t just “do business as usual.” 
 “Only the most creative companies can survive massive downturns,” he explains. “It’s worth noting that Airbnb and Uber were two travel startups that rose from the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis.” 
 Flymya is currently taking steps to scale down its user acquisition efforts and focus on improving on its code base and DevOps processes, which Pan says is a “silver lining.” 
 “You can take the time to reset, organize things. You can take time to do a lot of migrations so that’s nice,” he shares. “You don’t normally get the chance to prioritize that because it comes at a cost of engineering resources. We’re operating on a ‘day zero’ strategy, as if we were just forming a new company.” 
 Despite the slowdown in business, Pan says that Flymya is not seeking fresh funding. 
 “Luckily, we’re in a decent cash position, so we don’t have to fundraise – it may actually benefit us if we can emerge from this intact,” he explains. “I had a few conversations [with investors] prior to the crash, but I’m almost certain those conversations will go nowhere now.” 
 In the meantime, Pan says that the situation in China makes for a good case study to understand how the outbreak will affect business in Myanmar. 
 “With China, its domestic travel completely collapsed once all the quarantine measures were in place. [But that] is picking up now that everything’s going back to normal,” he observes. “We fully expect those two event patterns to play out here.” 
 Despite Pan’s optimistic view of how things will improve after the pandemic, consumers in China are still  hesitant  to return to their normal lifestyle. 
 Founded in 2015 by Mike Than Tun Win, Flymya bought hospitality system provider Switch two years later to boost the growth of its hotel bookings business. Pan, who started the UK-based software company in 2016, joined Flymya as CEO in 2018, while Than took on the role of chairman. 
 In 2016, Than also founded  BOD Tech Ventures , which has invested in a number of other Myanmar-based startups. While Flymya was hit hard by the decline in the travel industry, BOD Tech Ventures’ other portfolio companies – including microfinancing platform Daung Capital, food delivery startup Yangon Door2Door, online education startup DedaaBox, and ecommerce platform Spree – have seen a rise in business, Than says.

 The company said the Special Situations Fund can be considered as a “sub-fund” for its TNB Aura Fund II, which it’s targeting to close soon at US$100 million. “With the current market sentiment, which we expect to persist for at least another six months and possibly till next year, we’ll be witnessing a continued flow of startups facing urgent cash flow issues,” the company told  Tech in Asia . 
 TNB Aura said the investment will hopefully provide companies with 12 to 18 months of runway and help them focus on their targets. 
 The Special Situations Fund, which is open to a range of funding structures such as convertible notes or direct equity, focuses on startups in series A and B stages backed by venture firms and/or institutional investors. The company said it aims to turn around the funding within one to two months. 
 Interested startups may apply through  this form . 
 TNB Aura typically invests US$1 million to US$5 million in tech companies in the region. In December 2018, it closed its first fund at  US$22.7 million . Some of its notable investments to date include Singapore-based dental startup  Zenyum  and Indonesian business-to-business marketplace  Ralali , among others. 
 Last week, another Singapore VC firm launched a similar initiative. Early-stage investor Expara Ventures announced a  new accelerator  to back 30 companies and provide up to US$50,000 in funding. The program will focus on solutions that can detect the Covid-19 virus, share information about pandemics, and slow down the spread of the virus.

 Established in 2016, the agritech startup operates a platform that handles order management, logistics support, and financing options for farmers. It currently serves about 30,000 farmers. The platform connects these farmers to more than 115,000 retail consumers and over 5,000 business customers ranging from restaurants and hotels to food processing players, the company said. 
 TaniHub also provides cultivation and trade loans for farmers through its peer-to-peer lending platform, TaniFund. Launched in 2017, TaniFund has disbursed over US$6 million in loans to date, the company said. It has also been in an exclusive partnership with Indonesian charity fund Dompet Dhuafa to extend its service to livestock farmers in Java. 
 With the new funding, the company now looks to accelerate the production of its new services and expand geographically. TaniHub said it will be rolling out three new hubs to deepen its coverage in Indonesia and open a new automated packing and processing center in Malang, East Java. The company also plans to invest in operational improvements, including the implementation of automation solutions in its packing center. 
 Ivan Arie Sustiawan, the co-founder and CEO of TaniHub, said that the company remains focused on strengthening its partnerships, which include small- and medium-sized businesses. “We expect more robust growth for this year and hope we can reach all cities throughout the country by 2022,” he said. 
 Over the past year, TaniHub said it has seen a threefold growth year on year. 
 The startup currently runs five regional offices and distribution hubs in Bogor and Bandung in West Java, Yogyakarta, Surabaya in East Java, and Denpasar in Bali.

643725,How startups can shift gears and overcome the downturn," In times of economic expansion and prosperity, raising capital for a startup is much easier. Investors feel encouraged to pump capital into nascent sectors because the prospect of higher returns is more attractive. 
 However, the landscape changes when there’s a crisis. Now, founders need to contend with the dual catastrophes of the Covid-19 outbreak and the stock market crash. Though these hurdles may initially seem insurmountable – particularly for early-stage companies – it is possible to ride out the storm and use the circumstances to one’s advantage.

 First, entrepreneurs should focus on creating a financially sustainable business. In  an article  by the  Harvard Business Review , studies found that during the recessions of 1980, 1990, and 2000, 17% of the 4,700 public companies that were analyzed fared particularly poorly. They either went bankrupt, went private, or were acquired. 
 The same study found that 9% of these organizations did not simply recover in the three years after the recession but flourished and outperformed their competitors by at least 10% in sales and profit growth. 
 What differentiated the success from the failures was the ability to recalibrate in difficult situations. 
 Typically, businesses juggle between pursuing a growth-oriented strategy or a profit-centric approach. However, cash-strapped situations necessitate greater emphasis on generating revenue and profitability. This can be achieved by implementing more cost-cutting measures, carefully monitoring expenditure, and sticking to a strict budget plan in order to minimize burn rate. 
 Though early-stage startups lack the luxury of developing business continuity plans or huge cash reserves to fall back on during tough times, simply shifting gears and prioritizing profit over growth makes a big difference. Firms that possess  sound cash flow management  have a higher likelihood of surviving – and even thriving – once periods of economic downturn passes. 
 Moreover, tumultuous market conditions can create points of access to resources. Higher unemployment rates, for instance, present a wider pool of talent to choose from. These unique conditions allow companies to expand their businesses and make the most of their growth once the downturn dissipates. 
 Entrepreneurs who are able to capitalize on these points of access and simultaneously streamline costs to maximize profitability will stand out as one of the rare few who can hold their ground amid economic instability. 
 Second, startups need to be prepared to face a harsher fundraising environment. Reports have indicated that financial crises are associated with a  20% decrease  in the average amount of funds raised per funding round. Though this is more common with mature companies, the lack of capital in the market does suggest that those seeking funding will face similar issues. 
 Additionally, when investors flee stocks during market dips, public and private valuations will inevitably be slashed in conjunction with lower stock prices. If valuations tank, these firms are often forced into down rounds that diminish the value of common stocks. 
 Therefore, founders should adopt a more flexible mindset when planning to fundraise. Though entrepreneurs usually negotiate over valuation to lessen their relative dilution, this would be the opposite case when there isn’t as much capital in the market, as investors have the upper hand. Hence, in a down economy, entrepreneurs should expect lower valuations and, in turn, be prepared to accept more dilution in order to survive. 
 Startups that enter fundraising discussions with a more conservative outlook on valuations have a higher chance of being funded in spite of the negative market situation. 
 Finally, the Covid-19 outbreak is a good test to judge the entrepreneur’s ability to adapt in times of adversity. No doubt the pandemic will adversely affect companies from all industries. However, enterprises in certain sectors have the potential to benefit from the crunch. For example, those in the communications industry have seen increased traffic as businesses are now enforcing a work-from-home order. Adaptable entrepreneurs with an eye for opportunity will be able to make full use of advantageous moments to increase revenue growth and stand out. 
 It’s in these challenging moments when founders face greater scrutiny from interested investors looking to evaluate how they perform during adversity. Paul Stoltz, who came up with the concept of an “ adversity quotient ” (AQ) writes, “The higher a leader’s AQ is, the better the chances are of his or her success in a tough situation. Leaders who get back up quickly after facing defeat or failure are some of the organization’s most valuable assets.” 
 The founder who is able to display high AQ levels is thereby more likely to be able to secure funding from these investors in the future. 
 Crisis can be a catalyst. For well-prepared teams that are able to weather the vagaries of the market, an overall decrease in market activity makes it easier for them to cut through the noise and tell their story. In the startup world, adversity translates into opportunity for those determined and willing to swim upstream. ",Daniel Lin,2,4,"[(0, 0.48994225), (1, 0.24013597), (2, 0.2698811)]",[],[]
643804,Meituan reports solid Q4 but expects gloomy outlook for 2020," China’s largest on-demand service provider,  Meituan-Dianping , has warned of a potentially adverse impact from the Covid-19 outbreak on its business in the first quarter of 2020, despite reporting a better-than-expected fourth quarter in 2019, with revenues up 42% to reach 28.2 billion yuan (US$4 billion). 
 Meituan also reported a net profit of 2.3 billion yuan (US$319.8 million), marking its third consecutive profitable quarter since it went public in Hong Kong in 2018.

 However, the firm announced that as a result of the pandemic, it expects negative year-over-year revenue growth and an operating loss for the first quarter of 2020. It added that it is currently unable to fully identify the impact on the full year of 2020 due to the uncertainty of the evolving situation. 
 “Despite the short-term setback, we have strong confidence in our long-term growth. The pandemic has made society more aware of the urgency and importance of digitizing the service industry on both the demand and supply sides, and it has also strengthened our determination to continue upgrading many of the core elements of our business model,” Meituan’s chairman and CEO, Wang Xing, said. 
 In the last quarter of 2019, Meituan’s core food delivery business continued to grow, generating revenue of 15.7 billion yuan (US$2.2 billion), up 42.8% year on year and making up 55.8% of total revenues. Meituan’s transacting users in the 12-month period ended December 31, 2019 reached 450.5 million, up 12.5% from 400.4 million reported during the same period in 2018. The number of food delivery transactions was 2.5 billion yuan (US$352 million), an increase of 36.7% year on year. 
 Meituan’s in-store, hotel, and travel business contributed 6.4 billion yuan (US$901 million) in revenue, increasing 38.4% year on year, driven by the rising number of active merchants, which reached 6.2 million as of December 31 last year. The increasing number of hotel room bookings on Meituan’s platform also contributed to the growth, reaching 110 million domestic room nights, increasing by 47.9% year on year. 
 New initiatives and other segments, including bike-sharing and ride-sharing services, generated 6.1 billion yuan (US$859 million) in revenue, up 44.8% from the same period last year. Meituan said it has reduced losses from its car-hailing and bike-sharing services in 2019 by improving operational efficiency and developing synergies with other businesses on the platform. The new initiatives and other segments contributed 21.6% of Meituan’s total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019, its largest proportion since the company’s IPO. 
 Specifically, Meituan has continued to replace older bikes with new Meituan bikes, which are painted with the company’s signature yellow and can only be unlocked through the Meituan app. For the ride-hailing business, the firm scaled back the subsidies of its self-operating ride-hailing business and started integrating other smaller operators into its platform. 
 Meituan’s share price increased 6.4% to HK$93.65 (US$12.08) on Tuesday following the release of its financial results, resulting in a market capitalization of HK$544.97 billion (US$70.3 billion).

643730,Co-working spaces see a surge in demand – but it may not last," As Covid-19 continues to spread unabated, companies across Southeast Asia are looking to minimize the impact on their teams, partly by spreading their workforce across multiple locations. 
 That presents a big opportunity for co-working space operators. Several have reported a recent increase in demand and interest, though it’s not clear yet if it will translate into long-term opportunities.

 “We are seeing an increase in proactive conversations from our members and non-members,” says Turochas Fuad, WeWork’s managing director for Southeast Asia, noting that space has become a “crucial need” to ensure business continuity. 
 CoHive, which manages 37 co-working locations across Indonesia, has also been approached by multiple companies looking for temporary workspaces, says co-founder and CEO Jason Lee. Doing so allows businesses to station employees in several locations or reduce the need for commuting, he adds. 
 Another example is FlySpaces, an “Airbnb for workspaces” platform that lists down co-working spaces run by other companies across five markets in Southeast Asia. Based in the Philippines, FlySpaces is also seeing a surge in demand for temporary office spaces, says Peter Northcott, the startup’s vice president of marketing and business development. 
 “Whether it’s a need to evacuate buildings for sanitization or to ensure that larger teams are working in separate locations, we are seeing big jumps in these types of requests,” he observes. 
 Short-term play 
 That said, these are primarily short-term arrangements. FlySpaces’ partners are mostly operating with skeleton crews due to the Covid-19 pandemic, affecting the company’s ability to offer clients in-person viewings and site visits. 
 “This has led to a delay in larger decisions regarding office space for most businesses in the region – a natural response to this unpredictable environment,” says Northcott. 
 The situation is also evolving quickly and differently across countries, which adds another layer of difficulty for those that operate in multiple markets. 
 “While Hong Kong was impacted first in early February, it is more fully operational – for now – compared to Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines,” says Northcott. He adds that Singapore – the  most readily prepared  to handle such a crisis – has had strong business activity throughout, though its government is now putting tougher measures in place. 
 Of course, co-working spaces have to comply with measures aimed at communal or public places. JustCo, which operates 26 properties across Singapore, Jakarta, and Bangkok, is implementing stricter screening protocols including regular temperature checks and requesting guests to submit travel declaration forms. 
 All this may lead to at least a short-term increase in operational expenses. JustCo, for one, says that costs have gone up but declined to provide details. WeWork has also been making additional investments to implement more stringent screening procedures at its workspaces, adopting best practices from China, which has reported  no new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases  since the pandemic began.

 But Northcott also pointed out that because most co-working spaces are run by skeleton crews, operating costs are likely lower than normal. 
 “There were basic sanitization protocols, but nothing that would move the needle too much, in my opinion,” he shares. “Much of the burden is also on the building owners, not the [co-working space] operators, like temperature checks, for example.” 
 Even though government offices and private companies across Southeast Asia are asking most of their employees to work from home, these co-working spaces remain open. 
 CoHive’s Lee says that they’re still operational because some of their members haven’t implemented a work-from-home setup for their entire workforce. Some have only allowed alternating teams to do remote work, while others such as financial and medical technology firms require a secure environment as employees can’t take their work outside the office, he says. 
 Others are turning to co-working providers to explore flexible hot-desk solutions if they don’t find working from home feasible or productive, says Brandon Chia, a vice president at JustCo who heads the Singapore and Indonesia markets. 
 FlySpaces’ operators have come up with ways for clients to access the workspaces 24/7, says Northcott. More than 80% of co-working spaces’ capacity are private offices instead of the open communal hot-desking space, so most retreat to these less exposed areas. 
 What happens after 
 Still, these co-working companies see potential for longer-term demand. According to Fuad, who oversees WeWork’s 34 venues across six Southeast Asian countries, there have been discussions on more comprehensive future-proofing business strategy. 
 In fact, once the pandemic is over, some workspace operators believe that there will be a pivot towards co-working or remote working – if not entirely, then at least both will become viable options.

 “Due to Covid-19, many companies have maneuvered the way they operate from offline to online, and found out that they can work remotely,” explains Lee. Choosing one or the other, however, is not sustainable in the long run, he warns, because what employers and their staff really need are options. 
 Northcott of FlySpaces says that there will be a significant shift towards flexible work arrangements that go beyond setting up shop in co-working spaces. Decentralizing larger companies, for instance, will be a deliberate strategy, he adds. 
 All things considered, Lee says that co-working spaces have the right services for companies looking to distribute their workforce. “Companies will not be looking to purchase assets. [Instead,] they will be looking for the flexible solutions their employees are demanding, which are co-working spaces.” ",Putra Muskita,0,4,"[(1, 0.03463022), (2, 0.16818552), (3, 0.7971415)]","['JustCo', 'FlySpaces', 'WeWork', 'Northcott', 'CoHive']","['Airbnb', 'Singapore', 'Bangkok', 'WeWork', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'Indonesia', 'China', 'Jakarta']"

643700,This startup applies AI to street cleaning services," Street cleaning services are essential for city management, as they prevent trash from building up while keeping neighborhoods tidy and clean. However, it is a strenuous job that requires a large workforce and could be optimized with the help of technology. 
 This is what architect Chen Shuo wanted to address when his company,  Zero Carbon System , developed an AI-based driverless street sweeper. First produced in 2019, the firm’s cleaner machine, equipped with a camera and powered by an AI processor, is able to automatically clean streets while recognizing different types of trash, including plastic bottles, glass bottles, and litter. This way, the machine can also separate the waste according to the trash type, Chen told  KrAsia .

 Street cleaning services present an ideal opportunity for AI technology, as a single vehicle can replace eight to 10 human cleaners, according to Chen. Also, since cleaning work is similar across the world, this product could be applied globally without needing major localization, Chen believes. 
 Around the world, more than 500 million people are engaged in jobs related to cleaning, he explained, while the domestic market size for cleaning services in China could hit 350 billion yuan (US$49 billion) by the end of this year, according to market research firm AskCI Consulting. 
 Currently, Zero Carbon System already counts the government of Yangzhou, Jiangsu, as a key client, and is courting cleaning service providers, building management companies, and government organizations for its AI street sweeper machines. In Jiangsu, the firm established a fleet of 200 vehicles under a pilot operation, Chen said. 
  From low carbon architecture to AI  
 Shanghai-headquartered Zero Carbon System did not initially focus on AI when it was first founded in 2010. Chen, who studied architecture at Cambridge University, was passionate about applying low-carbon solutions to reduce environmental pollution. 
 “We founded Zero Carbon System with the aim to help the world to fight against global climate change and environmental pollution, by adopting cutting-edge technologies to lower carbon emissions to zero. This is something I wanted to devote my career for, through my whole life,” Chen told  KrAsia . 
 With that goal in mind, Chen and his team completed many low-carbon district planning projects. For example, his company built a low-carbon resort at Tunchang Muse Lake in Hainan province, where the company applied water conservation, new energy utilization, ecological farming, and waste utilization to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 
 Zero Carbon System has also built a series of low-carbon buildings, including a photovoltaic equipment inspection center in Shanghai for the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a low-carbon exhibition center for real estate developer Vanke. 
 However, Chen started to realize that low-carbon building planning was not enough for him to achieve his goal of helping people live in better city environments, he said. “Although the architecture projects we were previously working on could bring us revenues of hundreds of millions of yuan, it could probably just change the life of one group of people.” 
 He turned to AI to fulfill his vision. 
 “By applying AI to environmental protection and urban planning, our products can reach more people and change their everyday lives. We believe the more we are able to offer, the more significant changes our technology and products can bring to society as a whole.” 
 Chen and his team established a business division dedicated to AI within Zero Carbon System three years ago and started developing their self-driving AI-based street sweeper. 
  Opportunities amid the Covid-19  
 When the Covid-19 outbreak occurred at the beginning of the year, Zero Carbon System unveiled a new AI-based infrared temperature testing product, dubbed Firetinas. Launched in February, the tool can identify people with fevers in high-density public areas, such as airports, subway stations, and schools, Chen says.

 Using AI-powered computing chips and software, Firetinas can detect the body temperatures of up to 100 people at the same time, and identify those who might have elevated body temperatures, with a recognition error of ± 0.1° C, Chen claims. 
 The device has been already adopted by several institutions, including Ruijin Kangfu Hospital in Shanghai and the government of Guangling district in Yangzhou, Jiangsu. 
 “We hope to apply our experience developing Firetinas to overseas markets, to help countries and regions outside of China, including South Korea, Japan, Europe, and the US, to combat the Covid-19, which has become severe around the world in recent days,” Chen said. 
  AI tech to explore the marine environment  
 In 2016, Zero Carbon System completed an undisclosed series A round from Alibaba’s online equity crowdfunding platform Antsdaq, and Ge Bin, former executive of Sequoia China. 
 However, Chen didn’t want to rely anymore on fundraising after shifting the company’s focus to AI-based solutions, since he believes that self-driving technologies targeting the cleaning services market are able to generate revenue and become self-sustainable. 
 Monetization and profitability are crucial elements for an AI-focused startup-like Zero Carbon System, which now employs over 100 people, Chen said. To continue growing, he wants to keep discovering potential opportunities emerging from the market, and combine new products with appropriate sales strategies. 
 Chen says that his company is already profitable, after generating revenues of “hundreds of millions of yuan” by selling the street sweeper and the Firetinas devices. 
 In the future, Zero Carbon System plans to focus on developing AI-based products to explore the marine environment, and self-driving solution to apply on ships, while the firm will also devote half of their effort to work on low-carbon architectural projects, Chen said, without disclosing additional details. 
 When it comes to applying AI and other technology to boost business, the only challenge for entrepreneurs is to actually realize the potential of novel technologies, and not waste these opportunities to make a difference, he added.

643672,Japanese AI startup Cogent Labs nets $13m to expand in Asia,"  Cogent Labs , an AI solutions provider based in Tokyo, announced that it has raised 1.4 billion yen (US$13 million) in a series C funding round, bringing its total funding to 4.2 billion yen (US$39 million). 
 Aizawa-4 Limited Partnership, I Holdings, Comture Corporation, and Japan Co-Invest II Limited Partnership were the investors in the round.

 The company will use the new funds to accelerate its overseas expansion in Asian markets by localizing its existing services. It has already started its entry into South Korea and is currently cooperating with local business partners there, according to a statement. 
 Cogent will also enhance its natural language processing (NLP) capabilities as it looks to develop an education service and an enterprise search engine based on the technology. 
 The company offers four services, namely Tegaki, Kaidoku, Time-Series Forecasting (TSF), and consulting. 
 Tegaki is an AI optical character recognition service that scans handwritten documents so they can be saved as data, improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. Kaidoku, on the other hand, is Cogent’s NLP platform that can analyze and organize information, including text, trends, and causal relationships. 
 TSF can simultaneously process and analyze time-series data from markets and make forecasts based on the results. The technology is part of the stock trade volume prediction service that Cogent is providing Japanese investment bank Daiwa Securities. 
 For its AI consulting service, Cogent interviews clients to understand their businesses, and then proposes and develops solutions tailored to their needs. It uses what it calls AI Creator System, developed with Asahi Group Holdings, to produce product package designs using deep-learning models. 
 In 2017, the company raised nearly US$12 million in a series A round led by SBI Investment and Toppan Forms. It was followed by an US$11 million series B raise last year from Samsung Venture Investment, Kiwoom Investment, K2 Investment Partners, and Ncore Ventures.

 According to the report, Bytedance’s shares recently have been transacted on secondary markets with a company valuation of between US$90 billion and US$100 billion, up at least 20% from two years ago when SoftBank led a US$3 billion funding round for the Beijing-based company. 
 Tiger Global, also an investor in e-cigarette startup Juul and Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, did not disclose the volume of the investment. It projects Bytedance will account for a 19% market share of China’s online advertising industry. 
 The company appointed new China operation heads, while its founder Zhang Yiming will put his focus on global expansion.

643637,MatchMove to aquire stake in ecommerce enabler Shopmatic," Ecommerce and digital banking have a strong connection in Southeast Asia. According to a recent report from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, ecommerce sales in the region may reach nearly US$80 billion in 2022, up from US$41.3 billion in 2019. So, digital banks looking to serve users linked to ecommerce companies could scale more easily. 
 Today, Singapore banking-as-a-service platform  MatchMove  announced that it’s set to make a strategic investment in ecommerce enabler  Shopmatic . Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.

 The deal will allow MatchMove to extend its e-wallet capability to Shopmatic’s ecosystem of more than 435,000 ecommerce small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs across the region. It will power digital payments and provide cross-border remittance capabilities to enable these ecommerce companies to make and receive payments, according to a statement. 
 The move comes shortly after MatchMove announced that it had teamed up with Singapura Finance, Lightnet, and OpenPayd to apply for  a digital full bank license  in Singapore. Shopmatic co-founder and CEO Anurag Avula said his company will be working with MatchMove as its go-to-market partner in its digibank bid. 
 Shailesh Naik, the founder and group CEO of MatchMove, earlier said that the company has formed a network of fintech businesses with a large access to retail customers and SMEs, adding that the network includes an ecommerce enabler in Asia. 
 Naik said the strategy will allow the digibank to reach more customers and make its services available at a lower cost. 
 Last year, the startup also acquired a strategic stake in peer-to-peer lender  MoolahSense . 
 Singapore-headquartered Shopmatic, which was established in 2014, provides solutions to help SMEs set up an online store. Its offerings include setting up the storefront, payments, shipping and logistics integrations, sales management, and customer support. The platform integrates with several channels, enabling customers to sell on Amazon, Lazada, Qoo10, Shopee, Facebook, and Instagram, among others. 
 Last year, Shopmatic acquired  Octopus  and  CombineSell  to drive an omnichannel play for individual entrepreneurs and businesses in emerging markets. It currently operates in India, Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the UAE.

643598,Working from home is the new normal as we combat the Covid-19 pandemic," Dear readers, 
 Last week, I completely worked from home after  Tech in Asia  decided to limit the number of people at the Singapore office to 10 at a time. This is in compliance with  the social distancing measures  in the city-state as the government steps up efforts to curb the further spread of  Covid-19 . 
 Discussing and editing stories with the team via Slack, Google Hangouts, and WhatsApp, I realized how technology almost makes the transition and business continuity efforts seem seamless. Internet technology has advanced so much in the past 20 years that we can hunker down and do remote work  over long periods of time.

 During the SARS outbreak in 2003, we didn’t have the luxury of a robust internet infrastructure that could effectively facilitate remote working for millions. Back then, I was the Singapore bureau chief of the now-defunct AFX-Asia Financial News, which was  acquired by Thomson Financial  in 2006 and  merged with Reuters  the following year. 
 The government  shut schools and imposed strict home quarantine measures  during the SARS epidemic for residents who were returning from overseas trips. Thermal scanners were deployed at Changi Airport and other points of entry to screen visitors who might be infected by the disease. The World Health Organization declared Singapore  SARS-free in May 2003 , three months after the outbreak. 
 It’s hard to imagine how we would have functioned as a news organization if we had to work remotely in 2003. Certainly, the  wireless router at home , which could only handle 54 megabytes per second, would have buckled under pressure – the AFX team constantly reported market gyrations throughout the day with stocks and currencies tanking amid fears of the economic fallout from SARS. Thankfully, we now have more powerful routers and computers that are capable of handling up to 20 gigabytes of data per second. 
 Virtual summit 
 These technological advancements enable us to carry on with business despite the Covid-19 restrictions in place in many countries. For instance,  Tech in Asia  will use video streaming in July to launch the  Product Development Conference , our first-ever virtual summit. 
 Technology is also empowering entrepreneurs like my friend  Wei Yi Lim , co-founder of tuition center  Study Room . The center, which currently has 600 students, will close for a month starting this week and conduct classes online using the video-conferencing platforms of Zoom and Google.

 Amid these uncertain times, it’s important for companies to manage their cash and be quick in implementing changes to their operations – similar to the strategy Study Room is undertaking. Such pivots are necessary so that companies can endure and be prepared once the situation normalizes, startup founders and business leaders across Southeast Asia told  Tech in Asia   last week .

643643,"Despite Covid-19, shared-ride aggregator Via raises funds at a $2.3b valuation"," Via Transportation has raised US$200 million in series E financing, valuing the on-demand van-and bus-sharing company at nearly US$2.3 billion. 
 The fundraise comes as the Covid-19 pandemic has rattled the economic environment worldwide. Social distancing and work-from-home arrangements have severely curtailed businesses for ride-sharing apps and hotel aggregators, among others. Startups are also finding it particularly tough to secure fresh or committed capital from investors.

 So far, logistics and transportation services have bucked the trend. Total funding in February dropped 26% from a year earlier to US$4.6 billion, according to  analysis  by  Tech in Asia . Logistics and transportation was the top vertical with a US$1.1 billion raise across 13 deals. 
 In late February, Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing giant Grab said it raised over US$850 million from investors including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and TIS. Its Indonesian rival, Gojek,  closed  a US$1.2 billion funding round in mid-March as well. 
 Via’s latest round was led by Exor, the holding company of Italy’s Agnelli family. New investors include Shell, Macquarie Capital, and Mori Building. Existing investors Pitango, 83North, Hearst Ventures, Ervington Investments, Planven Ventures, Broadscale Group, and RiverPark Ventures also participated in the round, Via said. 
 “Especially in these difficult times, we greatly value Exor’s commitment to Via’s vision of a dynamic, data-driven public mobility system,” Via co-founders Oren Shoval and Daniel Ramot 
said in a statement. 
 Founded by the Israeli entrepreneurs in 2012, the US-based company helps aggregate multiple passengers or packages headed in the same direction. The app is available in more than 70 cities in 20 countries and has provided over 70 million rides around the world, the company said. 
 
  Source:  Via Transportation  
 
 Via says it works with regulators and public transport agencies across the world to make existing infrastructure more efficient. 
 In Singapore, it  partnered  with the Land Transport Authority to offer an on-demand public bus service. In Japan, Via has a strategic partnership with Itochu Corp. and Mori Building to offer a van-commuting service for the latter’s employees. And in Indonesia, it partnered with Teknologi Rancang Olah Nusantara (TRON) to offer mass transit and van-sharing services in Bekasi. TRON’s mobile app allows users to request a 15-person shared van. 
 Via’s partnerships with local players in Asia addresses a unique need. Most users in Africa, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and rural India take privately run shared vans – somewhere between a taxicab and a bus – due to the lack of public transport options. The app will likely address the issues of safety and pricing in these services. 
 Though industry giant Uber offers ride-sharing services for multiseater vehicles under its UberXL service, most users on its platform identify the app with its car service. The US-based company and its India rival, Ola Cabs, recently suspended their ride-sharing services in India, one of the world’s most densely populated countries, due to Covid-19. This followed Grab’s suspension of its GrabShare services in Singapore and the Philippines.

643560,How Grab’s super-app advantage is reconfiguring insurance for the masses," What Grab wants to achieve in Southeast Asia’s insurance sector is nothing short of a tall order: protect millions of families in Southeast Asia against life’s uncertainties, with simple, digital, and flexible services. 
 “We tailored these products to support our drivers in the worst-case scenario, [such as when] they’re unable to be on the road due to an accident or illness,” Tom Duncan, Grab’s head of insurance, tells  Tech in Asia .

 Duncan is in charge of GrabInsure, the super app’s digital insurance arm that was set up in April 2019. In the past year, GrabInsure has launched several microinsurance products in Singapore, Malaysia, and most recently, Indonesia. They range from personal accident and critical illness coverage to travel and e-hailing insurance. 
 Just shy of a year old, GrabInsure has issued over 7 million policies in Singapore and Malaysia. Its latest opt-in policies are in addition to  free personal accident insurance coverage  that Grab has been offering to its drivers and passengers since 2016. 
 What differentiates GrabInsure’s policies from existing plans in the market is how it charges premiums on a “per ride” or daily basis. Doing so makes it convenient for the millions of people who already use the app daily, whether for food deliveries, transport, or for employment. 
 The super-app advantage 
 Critically, GrabInsure’s microinsurance policies are low-cost in nature. “The major insurers are targeting a relatively small percentage of the population that has the income to pay for traditional high-premium products. What we see is a demand for more of the mass market, affordable, accessible health insurance,” Duncan explains. 
 Last month, Indonesian ride-hailing giant Gojek also  introduced Gosure , which was developed in partnership with local insurtech company  PasarPolis  and provides policies related to travel, motor vehicles, and mobile device protection. The beta version of the digital insurance attracted thousands of sign-ups between October 2019 to February 2020, a “positive response,” Sony Radhityo, head of third-party platform at Gojek, said in a statement.

 Being a super-app gives Grab multiple advantages over traditional insurance providers. The company has a customer base of over 185 million, serving over  9 million  drivers and merchants or micro-entrepreneurs across Southeast Asia. Its digital wallet GrabPay supports in-app payments for more than 600,000 merchants, while policy issuance is facilitated by a joint venture withChinese digital insurance giant  ZhongAn . 
 The  partnership  allows ZhongAn, which does not underwrite products outside of China, to tap into Grab’s ecosystem of users in Southeast Asia. Grab, on the other hand, can leverage ZhongAn’s technical assets and industry experience. 
  The super app taps into Zhong An’s  Fusion  system, which integrates with insurer systems via application programming interfaces (APIs) in real time, to launch insurance products rapidly. This allows Grab to provide scenario-based insurance, including bundling it with a ride at a very small premium or letting drivers activate auto insurance on demand.  
 The joint platform has proven crucial in facilitating Grab’s roll out of Covid-19 coverage, Duncan says. When frontline healthcare professionals expressed difficulties in getting rides to and from their workplace, Grab launched  GrabCare , a dedicated transport service targeted at healthcare workers in Singapore, Duncan notes. The following week, GrabInsure released  free Covid-19 coverage  for driver-partners who had volunteered for the GrabCare scheme. 
 Offering micropremiums 
 For segments of the economy unable to afford the hefty price tag for monthly or annual insurance plans, Grab’s focus on low-premium products is a potential game changer. 
 The company’s  critical illness plan  – a collaboration with  NTUC Income  – is aimed at Grab’s driver-partners and accrues premiums on a per-trip basis. That’s unlike regular insurance policies, which require insured persons to commit to a fixed premium sum over a period of time.

 Under the plan, Grab’s driver-partners can choose to pay between S$0.10 to S$0.50 (US$0.07 to US$0.35) per trip made directly via their in-app wallet to accumulate critical illness coverage up to an assured maximum sum of S$200,000 (US$137,000). 
 “As they drive, their cover builds up,” Duncan notes. The policy continues to cover these drivers-partners even beyond their employment with Grab. 
 In Malaysia, where e-hailing insurance is mandatory for drivers, GrabInsure provides  daily coverage  worth 1 to 2 ringgit (US$0.23 to US$0.45), a more affordable alternative to annual premium plans. 
 “Drivers can start building the cover by paying micropremiums rather than a lump sum, which can be a significant portion of their monthly income,” Duncan explains. 
 The company also offers  travel insurance , underwritten by Chubb, which charges a daily rate ranging from S$2.50 to S$4.90 (US$1.70 to US$3.40), depending on travel destination. The product saw an uptake of 10,000 within its first month in Singapore, according to Grab. 
 Grab users can also get additional  ride coverage  for S$0.30 (US$0.20) per trip, which will cover accidents that take place while in transit as well as on delayed transport pickups. So far, “thousands of people” have opted into this coverage, Duncan says. 
 The super app is currently developing a similar product to give consumers coverage for late food deliveries, which it has tested with a few of its vendors. “We saw really good uptake and an increase in sales [for merchants] in double-digit percentages, when we offer that sort of a product that pays out if the food is delayed by 15 minutes,” Duncan adds. 
 Getting creative 
 Grab’s foray into products with flexible premium terms come as digital players in the financial industry reimagine health insurance. 
 Alibaba-affiliate Ant Financial, which serves  900 million  people in China annually, has a  community-based product  in China that effectively crowdfunds payouts to the critically ill. It’s targeted at low income individuals who are unable to afford regular health coverage. 
 
  Photo credit: Grab 
 
 Called  Xiang Hu Bao  or “mutual protection,” the plan effectively provides free health coverage to members and is popular among rural communities in China. Ant doesn’t charge people who sign up and doesn’t require members to pay premiums. Instead, members collective pool together the payout sum when another member falls ill. 
 It’s a clever play on numbers that gives much-needed insurance coverage for millions who might not be able to afford it, yet keeps costs low – no more than 0.1 yuan (US$0.01) for every critically ill person, Ant said in a statement. In November 2019, just over a year after it was launched, the platform had registered  100 million users . 
 Duncan did not reveal if Grab would be introducing something similar down the line, but said that Grab was “studying different options […] including what’s happening in China.” 
 Insurance for the masses 
 In markets such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, more than 85% of retail insurance customers, particularly the young and digitally savvy ones, are open to buying policies from new providers, including retailers, automakers, or technology firms, a Bain &amp; Company survey found.

 “There’s a real unmet demand for health insurance in Indonesia,” Duncan observes. In the archipelago, the life insurance penetration rate, which is measured as gross written premiums as a percentage of per-capita gross domestic product, is 2%. In contrast, that figure is almost 10% in Singapore, according to Bain &amp; Company. 
 “When you look at all the other markets that Grab operates in [outside of Singapore], the accessibility and affordability of insurance is far lower. It’s far less likely that someone would have an existing insurance product that could cover them,” Duncan adds. 
 The low insurance penetration rate presents a huge opportunity in a market like Indonesia, where the inconveniences faced by users extend beyond delayed food deliveries or ride arrivals. Although gross written life insurance premiums grew at 11% annually from 2013 to 2017 in the country, consumer awareness of the value of insurance remains low, the same report stated.

 GrabInsure’s next target market for its personal accident product is Indonesia, where it serves  over five million  microentrepreneurs, including drivers as well as food and beverage merchants. It already offers health insurance plans for Grab users in Indonesia. 
 “All of the insurers realize that microinsurance or more flexible, affordable products are necessary, but it’s hard to [implement] micropremiums if you only accept credit cards or cash,” Duncan points out, who was part of the pioneer team at Chubb Digital. 
 Because of that, Grab’s payments capabilities, which supports GrabPay and Ovo – the super app’s digital wallet operator partner in Indonesia – will be a key differentiator. 
 At present, GrabInsure’s policyholders are mostly Grab drivers. “Both our critical illness and also that daily auto insurance product in Malaysia accounting for a large portion of those policies,” Duncan says. 
 What started as microinsurance for its driver-partners, however, is gradually expanding to encompass Grab’s broader ecosystem of users and their families. Among Grab’s policyholders in Indonesia, the ratio of insured people to each driver is 1.8 – an interesting metric, suggesting that many have purchased insurance coverage for family members as well.

 As Grab extends its reach into financial services, including a  joint bid with Singtel  for a full digital banking license in Singapore and newly established  a wealth management arm , its users in the city-state may soon have access to more modular services customized to their needs. 
 “If people want to add some form of life coverage [to their investment products], they could potentially add on or layer on a life insurance product,” Duncan explains.

643612,Telehealth startup Doctor Anywhere raises $27m to fuel regional expansion," Singapore-based healthtech company  Doctor Anywhere  said it has raised US$27 million in its series B round to drive its international expansion plans.

 Founded in 2016, Doctor Anywhere operates a digital platform that gives its users access to a network of established healthcare providers and doctors. The startup also  ventured into ecommerce  last year with DA Marketplace, specializing in healthcare products and services. 
 It plans to use the fresh investment to further its presence in Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, Doctor Anywhere founder and CEO Wai Mun Lim told  Tech in Asia . The company also looks to expand into new markets like Malaysia and the Philippines. 
 With its international expansion plans, Lim said that Doctor Anywhere will be scaling its technology infrastructure, building big data capabilities into its platform, and growing its network of healthcare practitioners. The company also plans to double its current workforce of 200 employees across the region over the next couple of years. 
 The investment into Doctor Anywhere comes amid the continuing rise of confirmed Covid-19 cases worldwide. 
 Chu Swee Yeok, the CEO and president of EDBI, said that the startup has been actively supporting Singapore’s fight against the pandemic through the deployment of its telemedicine platform at ferry terminals. It has also been providing medical services to home-quarantined individuals in the city-state, Chu added. 
 The pandemic, while unfortunate, has brought to light the need for telehealth as a tool and additional means to deliver healthcare services, Lim said. “During a time when public health systems are being stretched, telehealth can play a part in keeping these services from becoming overwhelmed.” 
 Since the Covid-19 outbreak started, Doctor Anywhere’s business has experienced a two to threefold jump in growth, said the CEO. 
 Amid the crisis, Lim said the new funds will allow Doctor Anywhere to maintain its operations and strategy for 2020 and beyond. 
 “While Doctor Anywhere has always ensured that we operate with sound unit economics, the Covid-19 situation does reinforce the need for us to continue to use capital wisely and in a sustainable manner, and to ensure that we continue to generate economies of scale and remain profitable per transaction.” ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(1, 0.9996665)]","['healthtech', 'EDBI', 'Anywhere']","['Singapore', 'Asia', 'Malaysia', 'Philippines', 'Vietnam', 'Thailand', 'EDBI']"
643362,Lalamove backs logistics startup Inteluck in $5m round led by MindWorks,"  Inteluck , a logistics company focused on first- and second-mile delivery, announced that it has secured more than US$5 million in a pre-series B funding round led by Hong Kong-based venture capital firm MindWorks Capital. 
 Infinity Venture Partners and on-demand logistics startup Lalamove, which does last-mile delivery, also participated in the round. 
 The deal marks the first strategic investment of Lalamove, which itself counts MindWorks as an early investor, board member, and shareholder.

 Inteluck started in 2014 as a software-as-a-service platform that monitors and manages shipments and drivers for trucking companies in the Philippines. After realizing that existing logistics providers were not able to fulfill the standards required by clients, it later transformed into a business-to-business logistics service provider. 
 “The biggest pain point in full truckload shipping for enterprise customers is that it is extremely challenging to optimize delivery with many dynamic variables,” Inteluck said in a statement. 
 Under its marketplace model, the company aggregates the fragmented supply of trucking companies for medium- and large-sized enterprises. It relies on data from external sources, such as road conditions and weather, and data collected by IoT devices from its fleet to optimize the delivery process. The startup also claims to generate higher utilization in round-trip loads and reduce waste by regrouping bookings. 
 Inteluck said it will use the new funds to launch an intelligent dispatch system and further expand its customer base in the Philippines. It currently has over 100 enterprise customers, including Coca-Cola, Oppo, and Asia Brewery, according to the statement. It also claims to have the largest trucking fleet in the country, with more than 17,000 certified trucks since early 2018. 
 The Singapore-headquartered company is now preparing to enter Thailand, MindWorks said, with plans to expand to other major Southeast Asian markets in the future. 
 Last year, the company raised  US$1 million  in series A money from Chinese VC firm Mingshi Capital (also known as FutureCap). ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(1, 0.9996249)]","['Lalamove', 'MindWorks', 'FutureCap']","['Singapore', 'Philippines', 'Thailand']"

 According to a 2019 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Food and Agriculture Organization, the total export value of tropical fruits stood at roughly US$15.5 billion in Latin America from 2016 to 2018. 
 DiMuto, which was founded in 2018, uses blockchain, internet of things, and AI to help digitize the agrifood supply chain through its Track and Trace platform. Its proprietary device tags each fruit and carton with QR labels, which are then uploaded onto its trade platform to improve visibility and trade transparency. 
 The startup seeks to solve various challenges in the industry, including food waste, safety, and sustainability. 
 “With data captured using our solutions, stakeholders in the agrifood supply chain are now able to see the quality of fresh produce being shipped, creating trust and visibility in the uncertainty brought on by Covid-19,” said Gary Loh, founder and CEO of DiMuto. 
 To date, the company said it has tagged over 30 million fruits and had a presence in over US$100 million worth of agrifood trades spanning seven countries including the US, China, Indonesia, Australia, and Mexico. 
 Late last year, DiMuto secured an  undisclosed amount of funding  to help drive its expansion into Europe and Latin America. 
 The startup was also one of the nine participating companies in Tribe Accelerator’s second cohort. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.9995311)]","['SGInnovate', 'DiMuto', 'Trace']","['US', 'Mexico', 'Singapore', 'AI', 'Europe', 'Australia', 'Indonesia', 'China']"
643579,Grab leaders to take up to 20% pay cut amid Covid-19 pandemic," As more countries place their citizens on lockdown to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, Grab announced it is providing additional relief initiatives to financially support its drivers, delivery partners, and merchant partners. 
 According to a statement, senior Grab leaders will take a pay cut of up to 20% to help the business and its partners cope with the negative impact of the pandemic. Employees will also donate to fund the company’s Partner Relief Initiatives.

 “The Covid-19 pandemic has caused immense financial anxiety amongst our driver-, delivery-, and merchant-partner community,” said Anthony Tan, group CEO and co-founder of Grab. “We want to do our part to support our partners. Thus, we have expanded our Partner Relief Initiatives to aid partners most directly impacted by this crisis.” 
 Over the past two weeks, the ride-hailing giant said it has expanded its financial assistance from Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam to Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and the Philippines. Through the scheme, Grab will pay out a sum to drivers and delivery partners who are hospitalized or quarantined due to Covid-19. 
 The company has also started providing relief measures for its GrabFood merchants. It will self-fund and partner with third parties to help select merchants with their marketing programs. 
 As more countries and cities restrict public movement, Grab has seen an increased demand for delivery of food, parcels, and daily essentials as well as a decline in its ride-hailing business. In response, Grab will expand its GrabMart and GrabAssistant services to more countries in the coming weeks to open up additional income opportunities for its partners. 
 GrabMart will expand to the Philippines, Myanmar, and Cambodia, while GrabAssistant will be available in more cities and countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. The on-demand concierge service will also relaunch in Vietnam over the next few weeks. 
 “We need to band together as a society – businesses, leaders, citizens – to combat the worst effects of this pandemic,” said Tan. “Even as our mettle is tested, let us continue to care for each other so we can all emerge from this stronger.” 
 Grab’s archrival, Gojek, has also created a  US$6 million  fund to support all its drivers, merchants, and other partners during the pandemic. Gojek’s co-CEOs and senior management will donate 25% of their annual salary as part of the initiative.

643557,Japanese AI startup AISing banks $6.5m in series B money," Japan has long been known for its competitiveness in manufacturing, yielding top exported products such as cars and integrated circuits. 
 Tokyo-based startup  AISing , which provides tech used in devices such as industrial robots and self-driving cars, said it has raised a total of 700 million yen (US$6.5 million) in a series B round to deepen its involvement in the industry.

 Local firms Sparx Group and Dai-ichi Life Insurance contributed 400 million yen (US$3.7 million) to the round, while Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Venture Capital chipped in the remaining sum, according to a statement. This brings AISing’s total capital raised to date to 900 million yen (US$8.4 million). 
 Since its establishment in 2016, AISing has focused on edge AI, or components needed to run algorithms locally on a device. Its products include Deep Binary Tree, an AI algorithm embedded in edge devices, and AI in Real-time, which was specifically developed for low-spec equipment. 
 The startup said it plans to use the new funds to improve the system of its Algorithm Development Group, a specialized development team for edge AI. It also looks to train talent for global expansion and increase its commercialization efforts, AISing CEO Junichi Dezawa said. 
 “In recent years, expectations for edge AI have been increasing worldwide, and we have entered the stage of further improving our technical capabilities and organizational structure to meet this need,” he added. 
 Sparx Group is an independent Asia-based equity and credit asset management service company that’s active in investment and real estate businesses. The company, along with Toyota and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, has invested in Mirai Creation Fund II. Some of the fund’s investments include Indonesia’s Pricebook, Singapore’s Anymind, and India’s Shuttl.

643331,Korea’s response to Covid-19 was widely praised. Startups had a lot to do with it," South Korea is increasingly attracting attention for its use of technology to fight the spread of Covid-19. 
 The country’s efforts to stop the virus were temporarily hampered by a religious sect that ignored government advice on how people can protect themselves and others, but by and large the Korean response to the outbreak has been fast, effective, and technology-driven.

 In recent days, the country has seen daily confirmed cases plummet, with death rate from the virus among the lowest in the world at less than 1%. 
 At the forefront of the country’s response to the pandemic is its aggressive testing and transparency, earning international praise and favorable comparison to measures elsewhere, including the US. 
 Transparency and access to data 
 Relevant authorities and startups have been given access to a wide range of information resources to track the spread of the virus and develop solutions to fight it. Case information and the movements of infected persons were also shared with the public through an interactive website,  Corona Map , and smartphone apps. 
 “Public participation must be secured through openness and transparency,” the country’s vice health minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters on March 9. He added that his team was making efforts to “respect creative thinking and use cutting-edge technology to develop the most effective means of response.” 
 South Korea’s high-tech, transparent solutions have allowed the country to not only “flatten the curve,” but also do it in a less extreme, authoritarian way than what can be seen elsewhere. 
 Aggressive testing 
 South Korea is a global front-runner in testing for Covid-19. The nation can now test up to 20,000 people per day, with an average number of 10,000. A number of municipalities, including Goyang, Incheon, and Sejong offer  “drive-through” testing pods  – the first country in the world to launch them. 
 The method has since caught on in  Germany , the  US , and  Great Britain . 
 The numbers demonstrate the strength of South Korea’s aggressive testing regime: As of the time of writing, it has tested 3,692 per million people, the best rate in the world. By comparison, the US tests just 23 per million. 
 Improved testing accuracy and speed 
 Various startups have also stepped in to stop the outbreak. 
 Seoul-based diagnostic company  Seegene , for instance, developed a diagnostic kit for Covid-19 that reduces the time to get results from 24 hours to just six hours. The company uses an AI-powered automated production system to produce tests more quickly. Its kits now account for around 80% of tests conducted in the country. 
 “It was an adventurous investment for the company to start developing the test kit, as we weren’t sure how contagious the virus would be at the time,” Park Yo-han, an investor relations manager at Seegene, told  Bloomberg . 
 Seegene is also supplying its kits to Germany and Italy and has plans to expand its reach to other countries. 
 Another startup, biotech firm  MiCo BioMed , has  developed a rapid molecular diagnostic system  that could detect whether a patient is positive in just an hour. The company previously developed equipment to catch bioterrorism pathogens for the 2017 U-20 World Cup, 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, and other such events. 
 Two other biotech startups,  Ahram Biosystems  and Doknip Biopharm,  teamed up  to produce a portable, battery-powered scan device that can identify the virus in just 30 minutes. 
 Authorities join hands with startups to improve access to masks 
 South Korea is one of  many countries  around the world battling a shortage of medical masks. In some cases, the public has been forced to wait in long lines, sometimes for hours, to purchase masks at designated sellers. 
 Representatives from several startups and South Korean government officials met at a hotel in Seoul this month to  discuss developing a mapping solution  that would alleviate the problem. 
 The startups discussed strategies, including sending out alerts through South Korea’s ubiquitous messaging app (KakaoTalk), adding medical mask data on existing map services, tracing local Covid-19 outbreaks, and creating a “mash-up development” using overseas public application programing interfaces. 
 Proving its commitment to the initiative, the government has already  begun releasing data  on publicly sold medical masks for developers to use in the creation of mask-mapping services. 
 Other agencies have also teamed up. The Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (an entity that reviews healthcare costs in the country), pharmacies, and post offices are offering their inventory and sales data. NH Hanaro Mart, a national retailer, is also in talks to provide information. 
 Authorities hope that national portal sites like Naver and Daum, startups, and the developer community can use the data to quickly develop web and mobile services that can better connect the public with medical masks. 
 Several startups are already doing this. 
 Boost Brothers, the operator of the hospital location and reservation app DdocDoc, recently  launched a mapping service  that indicates where masks are sold and how much stocks remain in real time. 
 The map, which is integrated into the DdocDoc app, updates every five minutes. 
 “Consumers are having a tough time finding sales channels, and places carrying stock, such as pharmacies, are experiencing chaos and work fatigue,” Boost Brothers CEO Song Yong-beom told local startup news outlet  Platum . 
 Water treatment startup OhMyWater is  leading a project of its own : a web service to inform the public where they can purchase medical masks. 
 The company has even enlisted the help of local startup hub D Camp to promote the project to resident startups. They also plan to host cooperative meetings with developers to further optimize the solution. 
 According to South Korea’s National Information Society Agency, 10 web and mobile service developers  have started offering services  related to state-designated sellers of medical masks. The country’s leading online search portals, Naver and Daum Kakao, will provide information on masks as well. 
 Social distancing: a case to crack 
 South Korea is currently undergoing its largest work-from-home experiment. Even the nation’s largest companies, which are known for valuing face time, are promoting remote work. Most schools and universities are closed until the end of March, and the government is encouraging minimal in-person contact, even outside the domains of employment and education. 
 This is an opportunity that South Korean startups are seizing to help the public cope. 
 For example, remote-work software provider Rsupport is  offering startups  and other corporations free use of its remote meeting solution to help them overcome the crisis. 
 Another startup, Classum, is  providing its online teaching service  to schools, educational institutes, and other learning professionals suffering from school closures and canceled classes. The company allows for questions, notices, notes, feedback, surveys, and anything else you’d need to conduct a class to be given through the platform and optimizes these for the online experience. 
 Even Techstars, a US-based startup accelerator that opened in South Korea this year, is putting plans in place to launch its first acceleration program in South Korea remotely. 
 Other startups  are addressing concerns , either mundane, social, or spiritual. 
 The laundry service,  LaundryGo , lets you place your dirty clothes in a “smart box” in front of your door for pickup. The service providers collect the box after midnight, wash your clothes, and deliver them in the box to your door by midnight the next day. 
 The service  uses natural detergents  made from a patented anti-viral ingredient, while superheated steam drying kills bacteria. The platform’s user numbers have climbed 20% since the Lunar Near Year holiday as South Koreans avoid visiting laundromats and dry cleaners due to Covid-19 concerns. 
 Meanwhile, social networking app Azar helps users overcome the stress of being cooped up all day by letting them connect over video chat with people from 190 countries around the world. Developed by South Korean startup HyperConnect, the service allows you to freely chat with strangers with one swipe of the screen – similar to Tinder. 
  Kokkiri , a meditation app, takes another approach, helping people find inner peace in these times of woe. Some 30 mediation and psychology specialists took part in the service’s production, most notably the best-selling author and Buddhist monk Hyemin Sunim, who is a lead content creator on the platform. Users get daily meditation and psychological wellness advice as well as ambient sounds, relaxing music, and other media to put their bodies and minds at ease.

643451,Why recruitment startup Glints is focusing on education," Every fresh graduate faces the same challenge: to find the right job that suits their passion and skills. The process of seeking employment straight out of university can be confusing and overwhelming, but there are job matching platforms that help would-be professionals find the perfect match, like  Glints . 
 
  Glints CEO and co-founder Oswald Yeo / Photo credit: Glints 
 
 Headquartered in Singapore, Glints was founded in 2013 by young entrepreneurs Oswald Yeo, Looi Qin En, and Seah Ying Cong to help job seekers in Asia connect with potential employers. The company’s eponymous platform originally matched candidates with jobs, but Glints is now evolving into a skills and career development platform that helps young professionals cultivate their expertise. 
 “We saw that there was a problem in Southeast Asia where a lot of young people lacked access to the right opportunities or the right skill sets to get to where they want to be. Many people, especially in places like Indonesia and Vietnam, go through many years of school but end up not getting the right skills for the job market,” Oswald Yeo told  KrAsia  in a recent interview. 
 He mapped out the mismatch that is present in the region. “There is a lack of supply of skilled talent available to meet the demand because the education system is not catching up fast enough to the needs of the industry, especially in certain verticals such as the tech industry. This creates an opportunity for job platforms like ours to not only take available talent out there to be matched with employers, but also create supply through training programs as well,” Yeo said. 
 Yeo himself never graduated from university, as he dropped out when he was attending the University of California, Berkeley to focus on the startup in 2016. “We started Glints before we started university. At the beginning, I wanted to juggle both, which was a terrible idea, and I also realized that I was not learning as many practical skills from university in the US, so I decided to come back to Singapore and focus on building Glints,” he said. 
 Last year, the startup launched Glints Academy, a 12-week coding bootcamp that equips young professionals with skills needed in the tech industry. The program offers a series of intensive training in full-stack web programming to transform beginner coders into full-fledged developers. After graduating from the program, Glints connects students with hiring partners like Tokopedia, FWD Insurance, AIA, and others. 
 In order to ensure that its curriculum is relevant to firms in the region, Glints listens to feedback from various tech companies to learn about what skills they need from incoming talent. In the past six months, 160 students have completed the program at Glints Academy, and 85% of them successfully landed a job within 60 days, Yeo said. The startup has received thousands of applications for the next batch, although it only accepts up to 50 people at a time. 
 Interestingly, Glints chose Batam, a city in Riau Islands, as the location for its academy instead of Jakarta. Batam was chosen for its proximity to Singapore, where many of Glints’ clients are located. “We have lots of Singaporean clients who want to get talent from Indonesia because there is not enough supply in Singapore,” Yeo said. 
 “So by residing in Batam, employers can bring them over to Singapore almost every week. Moreover, we want to give candidates exposure to overseas employers. There is a cross-border recruitment angle that we want to explore as we are now operating in three markets – Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam.” 
 Since Glints Academy trains students who may not necessarily have a stable source of income, they don’t charge any fees upfront. They currently offer students an income share agreement, where students can repay their tuition after they are employed. 
 Batam is only a starting point for Glints Academy, as it plans to open new schools in Yogyakarta and Jakarta in the near future. It will also launch online programs in April. “We want Glints Academy to be 100% accessible across Indonesia, so we are exploring possibilities to open offline courses in different locations, as well as online programs to reach more students.” 
 Glints’ recruitment platform is also showing promising growth. Its registered user count has increased fourfold from 2019 to 2020. Today, Glints has approximately 85,000 companies seeking future employees on the platform. It sees about 2 million unique visitors every month, according to Yeo. 
 Unlike job sites, Glints applies a full-stack recruitment model, meaning the platform only charges companies after they find the right candidates to fill the vacant positions. “With Glints, companies are able to fill positions very quickly at lower rates. We combine the skills of experienced recruiters with the efficiency of technology, the algorithm does initial shortlisting and our own recruiters will work with employers to follow up on candidates afterwards,” Yeo said. 
 Glints has raised US$9.7 million in funding so far. Its latest investment round yielded  US$6.8 million  led by Monk’s Hill Ventures in July 2019. The company is currently in talks with various investors about its next round of funding, but has nothing concrete to share for now. 
 Going forward, Glints wants to focus on transforming the company from a recruitment platform into a comprehensive recruitment and education network. The company is also eyeing Thailand and the Philippines for its next markets, but has yet to announce its timeline for expansions. At the moment, Yeo said they’re focusing on making Glints the top career platform in Indonesia and Vietnam.

643505,"Hospitality startup Airy pivots toward profitability, but the pandemic may slow its progress"," Indonesian hospitality startup  Airy  is pivoting toward profitability this year, after aggressively expanding its hotel network over the last five years and becoming the country’s biggest aggregator of budget hotels. 
 While the company believes the goal is achievable, CEO Louis Alfonso Kodoatie now has to contend with the Covid-19 pandemic, which has upended the travel industry worldwide.

 “My whole experience is enough to build a profitability strategy for Airy,” says Kodoatie, who spent the past decade working in the travel industry for companies such as Agoda and Traveloka. The business slowdown is an opportunity for Airy to improve its service and amenities across its properties, he says. 
 The startup was launched in 2015 with just two properties and a handful of hotel rooms. Today, Airy has a network of 2,000 properties with more than 30,000 rooms. According to the CEO, this is the right time for the startup to switch gears from chasing growth to pursuing profitability. 
 “When the number of our hotel inventories has reached a number that we want, we need to maximize the sales,” he shares. 
   
 But the endeavor will no doubt be an uphill battle. Governments around the world have shut their borders, and airlines have been forced to cancel flights in an effort to curb further infections. Popular tourist destinations in Indonesia, such as  Bali , are also bracing for the economic fallout from Covid-19. 
 Initial estimates from the Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association show that hotel occupancy in the archipelago decreased more than 20% as of mid-March, Kodoatie says. The numbers could get even worse, as Indonesia suspended its visa-on-arrival policy for a month effective March 27 because of a  spike in infections . 
 “Our occupancy rate also got almost a similar hit,” Kodoatie says. “However, we are optimistic that the pandemic will be resolved soon and the travel industry can recover.” 
 Prepare to bounce back 
 As the outbreak rages on, Airy is evaluating which strategies it can take to adapt to the fast-changing business environment. 
 Among the opportunities it’s exploring are increasing the quality of its properties and adopting new technologies that can help the startup provide better customer experience to its clients. 
 “With the right technology and service quality, we are sure that Airy can bounce back faster and have our business recovered as before,” Kodoatie notes. 
 Another strength it can leverage is its leading position in the industry, especially with its closest competitor, Oyo, downsizing operations. The latter entered the Indonesian market in 2018 and now has  1,700 properties  and more than 23,000 rooms. However, the Indian unicorn has recently  retrenched  about 5,000 staff globally to cut costs and focus on profitability. 
 While most of Oyo’s job cuts were made in China, several people close to the industry have said that the company’s Indonesia operations were also affected by the layoffs. Oyo currently has 1,100 employees in Indonesia, compared to Airy’s 400 staff members. 
 Despite having fewer employees, Kodoatie claims that Airy has become the market leader in Indonesia in terms of transaction numbers.

 Moving forward, the CEO wants to focus on improving not only the occupancy rate of its existing hotel merchants but also their  Gross Booking Value (GBV)  – or the total retail value of booked rooms for both travel agencies and hotel merchants. 
 To do this, Airy plans to help its hotel partners to have better pricing strategies. Budget hotel aggregators usually take a cut of between 5% and 10% from every transaction on its platform. 
 “Many of them [hotel partners] prefer to continuously do something that has been worked on in the past,” says Kodoatie. “We have to make them believe that we can increase their revenue.” 
 Despite the current circumstances, there’s a huge potential for the travel industry across Southeast Asia. According to a  2019 forecast by Bain &amp; Company, Google, and Temasek , the industry’s growth will be driven by online bookings for flights and hotels, which will reach US$78 billion in 2025 – up from US$34 billion in 2019. 
 
  Source: Google, Bain &amp; Company, and Temasek report 
 
 According to Kodoatie, Indonesia has tens of thousands of budget hotels across the country. Most of them are unregistered operators and less than half of these properties work with budget hotel aggregators such as Airy, he says. 
 “In the future, it’s important for us and the government to work together to help those hotels,” says Kodoatie. 
 Strategic partner 
 While Airy declined to share its funding information and the names of its investors, its tight relationship with online travel unicorn Traveloka is obvious. Other than calling Traveloka its “strategic partner,” Airy was also founded by two of the unicorn’s former engineers, and its past CEOs were also ex-Traveloka executives. Kodoatie is no exception. 
 Regardless, Airy has to face its own challenges. Aside from Covid-19, the startup must increase the retention of its partner hotels. It has already provided several technology innovations, such as self check-in stations and automation tools, to help owners better manage their properties and deliver a better customer experience. 
 Besides Oyo, Airy also competes against Singapore-based budget hotel operator RedDoorz, which claims to have  1,200 properties across Indonesia  under its belt. 
 That’s why it’s important for Airy to keep hotel merchants happy by giving them enough bookings, especially since hotel owners in Indonesia have a tendency to go “window shopping,” Kodoatie says 
 “They will look around, try to work with a company first, and see what they get,” he says. “If they aren’t satisfied with the revenue, they will move to other players.” ",Aditya Hadi Pratama,0,5,"[(3, 0.99985355)]","['Oyo', 'Prepare', 'Agoda', 'RedDoorz', 'Google']","['Singapore', 'Kuta', 'Kodoatie', 'Bali', 'Indonesia', 'China']"
643284,“I have to lay off my team because of Covid-19”," Dear Readers, 
 In the last few weeks, I’ve received confidential messages from founders that went along these lines: “I have to lay off my team because of Covid-19.” 😞 
 It’s one of the most heartbreaking decisions that founders have to make. But it isn’t just depressing emotions that they have to stomach: the employees that they let go will find it extra challenging to find jobs during this period. 
  Tech in Asia  went through some  rough patches  a few years ago, so I understand what these founders are going through right now. Over phone calls, I shared what I strongly believe in and practice, which is to be as transparent and empathetic as possible. Admit that we fucked up, and then move as swiftly as possible to course-correct. 
 Of course, there are things I wish I did differently. For instance, I could have considered giving people options. Maybe a company-wide salary cut could have helped create camaraderie and instill a greater sense of urgency. And if people had chosen to leave instead, then that’s only fair. 
 We’re also affected by Covid-19, especially our offline events. To curb that, we  moved  our Product Development Conference online. We recently also had a townhall meeting to discuss the impact of this pandemic. We remain cautiously optimistic and feel a sense of excitement at how we can use this opportunity to improve  Tech in Asia  on all fronts. 
 It would mean a lot to us if you can take three minutes to  fill out this user survey  to give us some feedback. 🙏

 “ Every crisis presents opportunities . We could have hung our heads and thought about how none of our original plans for the year could be realized. Change is the only constant and it is important to embrace change. So we were forced to stay calm, face the new reality, and find opportunities where we could.” 
 Stay optimistic! 💪

643241,Startups need to manage cash and have “a bit of luck” to survive Covid-19,"  It’s a grim situation for startups in Southeast Asia: Some companies are in danger of running out of cash as Covid-19 sours investor appetite and slows fundraising activities, founders and key executives tell  Tech in Asia .  
 “Even in a worst-case scenario, Crayon Data will last through 2020,” says Suresh Shankar, CEO of Singapore-based data analytics and AI startup  Crayon Data . “Since we aim to balance our books by then, we should be OK. But it’s not just us – the entire ecosystem needs a bit of luck, if we are to go further.” 
  A survey conducted by  SEA Founders   , a nonprofit organization representing over 100 startup founders, shows that a majority of startups in the region are finding it difficult to reduce burn rate as their revenue has been hit by the pandemic. About 80% of startups around the region have been negatively affected by the outbreak, according to    a recent  Tech in Asia  survey   .   
   
 “Due to Covid-19 affecting the investment landscape, we need to lean towards a more conservative plan through which all of our business divisions will be self-sustained within the next six months,” says Shieny Aprilia, chief marketing officer of Indonesia-based  Agate . The video game developer has also taken a hit in revenue – an outcome made worse by delayed payments from its clients, who operate in negatively affected sectors, she says. 
  But the situation will only get worse before it gets better, with  fundraising across    Asia Pacific dropping 26% in February, following a 52% slump in January, according to data compiled by  Tech in Asia .   
  Indeed,   Silicon Valley venture capital firm  Sequoia Capital    urged its portfolio companies earlier this month to brace for the negative business impact of Covid-19, which it dubs “the black swan of 2020.” It will take several quarters before the pandemic is contained, and it will take even longer for the global economy to recover, Sequoia said.

  To make matters worse, the pandemic has also put a damper on all facets of fundraising –   not only have ongoing funding rounds been delayed, some founders say they can’t even get the ball rolling.   
  “Crayon Data will still grow through 2020, since we already have contracted coverage for about two-thirds of our revenue targets,” according to Shankar.  
   As the company has received fundraising interest from investors, the CEO remains optimistic, but he is cautious as to when these will translate into an actual deal, and on what terms.   
  In the meantime, Crayon Data is implementing cost-cutting measures to extend its runway. “Our intent is to protect all jobs,” Shankar says. “To make that possible, new hiring and investments are frozen. And we are implementing a principle of everyone collectively sharing in the burden, with senior management taking more of the pain of pay cuts.”   
 Closing deals becomes considerably more difficult. 
  Eduardo Saverin-backed  Perx Technologies , a customer engagement platform, is also feeling the pinch. “Our large enterprise pipeline is still considerably strong since we have purpose-built our platform to serve all industries,” the company’s CEO, Anna Gong, says. “During Covid-19, certain industries, like telcos, fintechs, gaming and supermarkets will be more resilient than others. Nonetheless, many of the corporates’ operations have been severely compromised.”   
  The obstacle comes as the startup is undergoing restructuring and adjustments to cope with the impact of the pandemic, which has affected the retail industry – one of its four target markets. “Closing deals becomes considerably more difficult, which in turn impacts our own quarterly projections and planning,” says Gong. “With such delays, we have also reset revenue guidance and expectations just like all businesses around the world, large and small.”   
  Glass half full  
  Not all is lost, however. Despite the prevailing uncertainties, it’s clear that startups are optimistic, and many founders are eager to share their tips for survival.   
  Now is the time to optimize cash flow,  says    Lim Der Shing, founder of Singapore-based recruitment portal JobsCentral. “Make sure you have enough cash to last at least 18 months. If you don’t, cut costs and drive revenue until you can,” he advises.  
   
  Some startups, on the other hand, are capitalizing on the situation.  PouchNation , for one, is exploring speeding up its online product roadmap, CEO Ilya Kravtsov tells  Tech in Asia . The event management startup is looking to diversify into digital concerts using online streaming technology as well.   
 Think creatively and challenge all assumptions. 
  “Now is the time to pivot,” says   Hian Goh, a partner at OpenSpace Ventures. “Think creatively and challenge all assumptions.” Ultimately, it’s the lack of innovation or “inaction” that could lead to a startup’s demise, not Covid-19, he  wrote on LinkedIn .   
  Perx Technologies’ Gong agrees, “  For most startups that focus on a niche product, they need to reevaluate their target markets as well as creatively position themselves by repackaging their offerings or a portion of the solution. Whatever playbook you had before, it will not be the one you’re executing on in the next few months.”   
  That’s exactly what online talent recruitment startup  Glints  is planning to do. In light of the pandemic, the company is looking to expand into remote work and online education, which could speed up the adoption of its solutions by up to two years, says Glints CEO Oswald Yeo.  
  While Gong agrees that startups need to pivot and execute contingencies and continuity plans during these uncertain times, she points out that organizations also need to define how and when they will regain stability once the situation normalizes.  
  Now more than ever, it’s important for startups to build rapport across the region, says Tomas Laboutka, founder of SEA Founders. The stress among managing teams only reinforces a “motivation to foster meaningful relationships,” he says.   
  For Agate’s Aprilia, on the other hand, startups must aim for profitability as fast as they can. “If you want to expand, make sure your core business is strong first, and then you can expand,” she cautions.   
  At the end of the day, remaining positive could go a long way in these challenging times.  
  “  Be calm, be paranoid, be opportunistic, all at the same time,” says Crayon Data’s Shankar. “There is always a move. Don’t give up. Resilience is the key.”

643469,Singapore startup using blockchain to keep certificates gets seed funding," Singapore-based  Edufied , a credential validation startup, said it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding at a valuation of nearly US$4 million. 
 The capital was raised via a group of private investors, according to a statement.

 Established in 2018, Edufied offers a blockchain-based system that allows agencies to provide e-credentials easier. It reduces the amount of admin work needed and helps prevent fake certificates or claims from happening. Receivers, in turn, are given academic and training passports to store and share their credentials securely. 
 After initially focusing on the academic sector, Edufied expanded its reach to serve clients from professional and government organizations. 
 Ryan Soh, the founder and CEO of Edufied, said the company plans to use the new funds to expand in both Singapore and the Philippines. “With a larger footprint, we will be enhancing our support team to serve our clients better and focusing on a client-centric approach to improve our product,” he said. 
 By 2021, the company aims to have a presence in five countries. 
 During the past year, Soh said that Edufied has been setting up its foundation, onboarding clients such as the Philippine’s AMA Education System and Philippine Merchant Marine Academy, and pilot testing with government agencies in the country. 
 The company also said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Singapore Association for Private Education to roll out its product to the agency’s 34 institution members. 
 In September last year, Edufied became a finalist in PIER71, a joint initiative from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and NUS Enterprise aimed at supporting the maritime innovation ecosystem. Through the program, the startup set up a new business unit called Marified, which provides marine crew with personalized e-passports to digitize certification management.

643428,"Hooq, Singtel’s video-streaming service, files for liquidation","  Hooq , a video-streaming service backed by Singapore telco major  Singtel , is filing for liquidation after failing to sufficiently grow and provide sustainable returns,  Reuters  reported. 
  Tech in Asia  has reached out to Hooq for a statement.

 Hooq, which is part of Singtel’s digital life segment, was introduced in 2015 as a joint venture with Sony Pictures and Warner Bros, at a time when US-based Netflix was starting to expand across Asia. The service offered Hollywood movies and television shows as well as local programming, something that Netflix lacked at that time. 
 But Hooq struggled to make major gains as its US rival entered more markets in the region, not to mention regional player Iflix’s growing presence. 
 Iflix initially launched in Malaysia and the Philippines, after securing  US$30 million  in funding back in 2015. Now, its services are available in 13 countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, the Maldives, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal, and Bangladesh. 
 It recently announced a  partnership  with TikTok, owned by Chinese tech giant Bytedance, which would see content from the short-video app becoming available on Iflix. 
 To further tailor their services according to the region’s needs, both Hooq and iFlix adopted freemium models. Iflix co-founder and CEO Mark Britt previously said adopting Netflix’s purely subscription-based model would not work in the long run in Asia. 
 In 2018, the platform announced that it would start offering its content for free, with its model largely supported by ads. The new tier was offered alongside its current subscription options. Hooq, on the other hand, took a different approach. It started offering free-to-air TV in the same year for all its subscribers, including those in the free tier. 
 According to  Reuters , Singtel doesn’t expect Hooq’s liquidation to have any material impact on its own net tangible assets or earnings per share.

 “With Fund VI, we are extremely excited to continue investing globally in deep, disruptive technologies that are creating solutions that are more inclusive and sustainable for societies around the world,” Vickers chairman Finian Tan said. 
 Founded in 2005, the VC firm focuses on early-stage investments in Asia and beyond, covering life sciences, technology, media, telecommunications, as well as consumer and financial services. 
 One of its most recent investments include UK-based biotech company Emergex, which raised  US$11 million  in a series A funding round earlier this year. The startup is trying to develop safe and effective vaccinations against Covid-19 and other prevalent infectious diseases. 
 Vickers has also backed Singaporean fintech startup MatchMove, which is currently valued at about  US$300 million . Other portfolio companies include Samumed, Snapcart, M-Daq, and the Asian Food Channel, among others. 
 In October 2017, the company raised  US$230 million  for its Fund V to invest in startups globally, with a focus on deep-tech and impact investments in emerging markets. 
 “Fund IV and V have a projected return of 10 times, and we expect Fund VI to follow in the footsteps,” Tan told  Reuters .

643435,Coca-Cola’s VC arm invests in Indonesian logistics startup Kargo," Road logistics amounts to 16% of Indonesia’s gross domestic product, with around US$40 billion spent on trucking each year, Tiger Fang, CEO of  Kargo Technologies , said. 
 To take on the growing opportunity, Fang’s startup today announced that it has secured an undisclosed amount of strategic investment from Amatil X, the venture capital arm of Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia. 
 With the new investment, Kargo said it will address all Coca-Cola’s trucking needs, including digitizing its supply chain in Indonesia. It will also use part of the new funds to provide loads and cash flow to help its transporters survive the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the startup told  Tech in Asia .

 Founded in 2018, Kargo integrates shippers and logistics providers in a marketplace. Through its website and mobile app, shippers, transporters, and truckers can connect and transact with each other and track shipments in real time. Transporters can access jobs directly from shippers, while the latter can find convenience in an online booking platform. 
 “The industry is highly fragmented, with 7 million trucks operating across 17,000 islands. Ninety percent of trucking companies have 100 trucks or less and 75% have 20 trucks or less,” said Fang. 
 Kargo can source loads for the backhaul, which means trucks can return with fewer empty loads, allowing businesses to maximize revenue and better distribute costs, the CEO added. 
 Last year, the company received  US$7.6 million  in a seed round led by Sequoia Capital India. The round also saw participation from investors such as the 10100 Fund by Uber founder Travis Kalanick, Intudo Ventures, and Innoven Capital, among others.

643446,"Smartphones, QR codes now indispensable in quarantined Beijing"," 
 Before leaving my hometown of Tianjin, where I spent my Chinese New Year holiday, I would have never imagined that my phone, some new apps, and QR codes – otherwise mainly used for mobile payments – would become even more essential tools back in Beijing. 
 I knew I would be greeted by quarantine regulations forcing me to stay in my apartment for 14 days upon arriving, due to the coronavirus outbreak that took the country by storm. I was prepared for some hurdles: loneliness, lack of fresh air, and my own bad cooking skills. However, I never expected the gate of my residential compound to be the biggest hurdle of them all.

 All over Beijing, thousands of residential compound administrators and authorities have been busy ensuring people stayed indoors and obeyed their quarantines. The same happened in my compound. 
 After arriving, two people wearing guard uniforms, both wearing masks, were standing in front of the gate. One of these guards, a man in his 40s, was asking every person to present their entrance passes before getting inside the compound. It was around 12:30 PM, and the line was about three or four people long. 
 I walked up to the second guard, told him my story, and presented my key. I was just about to continue on my way until he stopped me. 
 “You have to provide some personal information before re-entering your apartment,” he said, as he pulled several documents from the pile. It looked like he had done the same thing hundreds of times already, including the standard speech to all returnees like myself. 
 The documents included two copies of a notification letter for the quarantine, indicating that I was required to undergo a 14-day quarantine as stipulated by government regulations, and two copies of a commitment letter, which I had to sign before continuing. 
 I filled out and signed all the documents. The guard took one copy and told me to keep another, which I would have to hang it on my apartment door, to let my neighbors know about my predicament. 
 Next, I scanned a QR code that took me to a WeChat mini-program called Jingxin Xiangzhu. The guard told me returnees from other places in China are required to give their address, arrival date, and health condition via this mini-program when checking in with their residential compounds, as per government regulations. 
 Launched on February 12 by the Beijing government, with technical support from Tencent’s cloud computing unit, the WeChat-based mini-program has received over 50 million views as of March 1. The platform is also accessible through the Alipay and Baidu apps. 
 In addition to a check-in tool, Jingxin Xiangzhu can be used by residential compounds to track the health of residents who are going through the 14-day lockdown. Returnees have to report their body temperature and any potential symptoms related to the epidemic via the mini-program on a daily basis. After finishing the 14 days, the app sends users a certification in the form of a QR code, which can be used to get approval for leaving the compound. 
 I thought I heard about this before, but it was still surprising to see the initiative actually rolled out and put in place. As a tech reporter for  KrAsia,  I had written daily articles in the past weeks on the technology being used to contain the coronavirus, but this was my first truly hands-on experience. 
 While I usually spend hours exploring different mini apps and other platforms for the sake of journalistic research, now was different: I just wanted the whole process to be over so I could get inside my home and rest after nearly two hours on the road. 
 Just when I was about to start checking the new documents, the guard asked me to provide my location information during the past 30 days, just to make sure I didn’t visit any places close to Hubei, the epicenter of the coronavirus. 
 First, I sent a text message to China Mobile, one of the three major state-owned telecom carriers, to authorize it to access to my location data. Then, I received a message from the carrier, saying that I’ve stayed in Tianjin for the past 30 days. Wondering how the telecom carrier got my location information, I handed my phone to the guards, who took a picture of the location message on my screen. 
 “You don’t need to worry, you haven’t been to anywhere close to Hubei,” he said. 
 The next two steps were the quickest and easiest. The guards tested my temperature – 36.5 degrees Celsius – and gave me three large plastic bags for the trash I would accumulate in the coming two weeks. 
 “You can put the bags in front of your apartment door once they are full, and call the managing office to remove them,” he said. 
 Finally, the guard gave me the last instruction, one that felt like it was right out of an apocalypse-themed gameshow. 
 “Now, you have to buy everything that you’ll need for the next 14 days,” he said, and pointed to the supermarket down the street. 
 My mind went blank for several seconds – I hadn’t thought about what I will do about food during my quarantine, except for the prepared food I had with me. Instead, I had just a few minutes to put together a 14-day meal plan and buy ingredients in 20 minutes.

 I rushed to the supermarket, picking up anything that could last more than two weeks. A large bag of mixed vegetables, several packs of instant noodles, milk, bread, rice, and a few other things. When I returned to the gate, I piled all the food up, and the guard took a picture of it – as required by the managing office, he said. 
 “You’re all set! Please remember to report your body temperature every day, and you’ll get an entrance pass when your quarantine is over,” he added. 
 Finally, I was allowed to return to my house after spending nearly an hour getting through the front gate. Later that day, I found my personal info page on the Jingxin Xiangzhu mini-program, marked as “checked-in with the compound.” This meant my 14-day quarantine had officially started. 
 As I was starting my isolation period, I talked over the phone with some friends who just finished their quarantines. They told me that even after finishing their lockdowns, they need to use QR code-related technologies wherever they go in the capital. 
 My friends were talking about Beijing’s recently unveiled  color-coded QR system  which, similar to Jingxin Xiangzhu, tracks whether they have been quarantined or not, and assigns users one of three colored QR codes, green, yellow, or red, depending on their status. 
 The app, accessible via mini programs on WeChat and Alipay, let users register after submitting their name, national identity number, and face scan. Then, it sends users a colored QR code, which they can present at checkpoints upon entering public places such as shopping malls, restaurants, or parks. These color-codes are not mandatory, but many public and private places are enforcing their use as a precaution. 
 Users with a green code – for those who have finished their quarantine or have not been in affected areas – are allowed to moving around the city relatively freely, while a yellow code means they are still required to be undergoing a 14-day self-quarantine at home. A red code indicates a supervised quarantine,   in which the person has to go to a designated quarantine location where they will be monitored by medical personnel. 
 These colored QR codes refresh automatically every day, according to the latest data received by the government. For example, if the authorities receive information that a user might have been in contact with a suspected case, the QR code could unexpectedly change to yellow or red.  In addition to the color-coded QR system and the Jingxin Xiangzhu app, many Chinese companies are also using office collaboration apps to track employees’ status. My friend Emily, for example, was required to fill out an online form via WeChat Work several days before going back to work. She had to provide the date she would return to Beijing, whether she was still under quarantine, her planned date and time to be in the office, and her health condition. 
 Then, she was issued a pass and a QR code on WeChat Work indicating she could enter the office building, which she has to present to a guard at the entrance every time she walks inside. Other office apps, such as Alibaba’s DingTalk and Baidu Hi, also have similar functions to support the resumption of work. 
 My quarantine ended on March 15, and I have now a beautiful green QR code on my phone, which I show – quite happily – every time I need to leave my house. I hope this color will never change.

 The firm said to  KrAsia  that Fenfu, which targets those unable to get traditional credit cards, will become accessible to more users gradually. 
 “Fenfu is a brand-new quasi-installment consumer loan product, which, after being activated, allows users to borrow money anytime they want, and repay anytime they like, with interest being calculated by days,” Tencent said on Friday in a written statement. 
 The virtual credit card service, which Tencent started to develop last September, as  KrAsia  reported, will potentially allow the tech giant to compete with Ant Financial, which has a virtual credit card service called Huabei allowing microloans to be repaid by installments, also offering an interest-free period. 
 Although previous reports indicated that Fenfu will also offer interest-free loans, Tencent confirmed that such service will not be available.

One of the biggest obstacles the country’s facing is the limited supply of test kits, making it difficult to aggressively curb the spread of the virus. 
  Nusantics , a local deep-tech startup in the field of genomics, and early-stage VC firm East Ventures are looking to address this problem. East Ventures is an investor in  Tech in Asia .

 Nusantics is a member of the Technological Research and Innovation Task Force for Covid-19 under Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT). In the next three weeks, the startup will develop a test kit that can detect Covid-19 infections, according to a statement. 
 “Technology that Nusantics uses in skin microbiome analysis is similar to technology used to detect Covid-19,” Nusantics CEO Sharlini Eriza Putri said. The startup analyzes profiles of microbiomes – the genetic material of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa – to fulfill consumer needs. It also recently secured  seed funding  from East Ventures. “Our sense of duty to Indonesia and the right background move us to contribute more,” the chief exec added. 
 Nusantics said it has committed to produce 100 test kit prototypes, then continue with mass production of 100,000 test kits. 
 It also looks to run whole genome sequencing to profile the virus genomic, an essential step as the disease continues to mutate to adapt to its host and environment. The company will use the data to validate test kits. 
 In support of Nusantics and BPPT, East Ventures has launched a movement called Indonesia Pasti Bisa to mobilize its digital network and lead a fundraising campaign for the test kit production. 
 The firm aims to raise 10 billion rupiah (or over US$600,000), according to the statement. Ninety percent of the fund will be used for the test kits, while the remaining portion will be allocated for the whole genome sequencing project. 
 East Ventures has tapped its portfolio companies, fintech startup KoinWorks and media company IDN Media, as accountability and transparency partners, respectively. 
 According to East Ventures co-founder and managing partner Willson Cuaca, KoinWorks will be contributing its expertise in compliance and disbursement management, while IDN Media will provide skills in outreaches and storytelling.

643074,What startups can do amid Covid-19,"  This article is from an episode of  Matrix Moments  by Matrix Partners India, a podcast featuring candid conversations on what it really takes to survive the startup world. This is heavily revised from the original show transcript. For the full interview, go  here .  
 With the rapid evolution taking place in the global business environment, we’re dedicating today’s episode to discuss and decode the implications of the Covid-19 outbreak on the startup ecosystem.

 Rajinder Balaraman, director of Matrix Partners India, and Matrix Partners founder and managing director Avnish Bajaj talk about how things may play out amid the crisis and how startups should respond. 
  Rajinder Balaraman (RB): Any thoughts on the current panic over Covid-19? Is it warranted?  
  Avnish Bajaj (AB):  There are times when a disproportionate response is the proportionate response. I think this situation needs a disproportionate response. 
 What we really need to do is cut the number of people that can get infected by just increasing social distancing and social isolation. So I think it warrants a very, very aggressive response from all of us – not just from the government – over the next two, three, four weeks. And hopefully with that, we will tide over it. 
  RB: How would you compare this crisis to the ones that we’ve seen before? What is the possible impact on the startup ecosystem?  
  AB:  Obviously, none of us have seen this before, so the economic impact is unclear. You’re seeing the Federal Reserve in the US cut rates to zero, and people might compare it to the global financial crisis or the dot-com bubble. But I think this is very, very different. This is a combination of a health and an economic crisis. 
 I don’t know how this measures up to the other crises, but if it plays out like China – where after six to eight weeks factories are now coming back online – tech and startups are going to see the shift because they can rebound very quickly. 
 But this outbreak is much harder to call. If we continue down this linear path, that would be great. I’m afraid this may not happen unless we really hunker down and start practicing social distancing norms. If that happens and the heat comes in the end of April to mid-May and there may be no coronavirus, it’s going to be a very rapid uptake for tech and startup companies. 
 But I think the answer will be clearer in the next two to three weeks. 
  RB: What is your perspective on an appropriate response for companies today?  
  AB:  I think working from home is the easiest tactical part of it. But the Boston Consulting Group came out with  a report  that has some other good strategies. It answers questions like, “How do you plan through something like this and bring business continuity?” 
 For most startups, they have not had to think about business continuity. Founders are worrying about funding, they’re worrying about other things, but they’re not learning about how a business can have continuity. 
 What is the company’s main risk? How can my sales people continue? So I think that is a very tricky thing. 
 Some of our peers, like  Sequoia  and  Lightspeed , have put out some guidelines. 
 Often, I evaluate these situations not as an investor but as an entrepreneur. As an investor, I would look at various things like cash flow, spontaneity, runway, and all of that stuff. If I put on my entrepreneur hat, I would concentrate on the recovery curve from recession. 
 Probably, until the end of this month, I’d operate under the V-shape scenario, where the recession happens then recovers quickly. Under this scenario, I’d ask, “What are the things I can do to move to variable costs?” 
 But if it gets into the nonlinear, exponential kind of a situation, then I would be more worried and move to plan B, which would be expecting a U-shape recovery – a longer process than the V-shape scenario. 
 These are the possibilities, and as a business leader, you have to think through these possibilities so you won’t get blindsided by them. In this situation, I would just keep decent ideas in mind and have some clear plans on what would happen in each case. 
  RB: This all makes sense, but there’s still a lot of uncertainty. What should companies do? What are the best practices?  
  AB:  There should be one designated person at the co-founder level who’s in charge of this situation. I think that is a no-brainer. It can’t be that four co-founders are in charge of the situation in general. So, I would be very clear that you should put one person in charge of this who has your confidence, who’s thinking through all of the scenarios. 
 But like I said earlier, the report from BCG can help. I don’t have all the best practices, so hopefully people can share their own here. 
 The positive note is that we have survived everything as a civilization, right? And if ever, we are more ready to deal with stuff now, and I’m pretty optimistic that if we just manage to play this out over a period of time, this is going to get much better.

643388,"As Honestbee sought $150m, its ex-CEO was absent from pitch meetings","   ﻿  ﻿    
 ||item|| 
 Throughout 2018 and early 2019, the hype around Honestbee was peaking – but it was running out of cash. 
 There was no better time to fundraise, so it did just that. Brian Koo, the startup’s main backer, initially pursued valuations of  over US$1 billion . Meanwhile, the Honestbee team was wooing investors in Singapore by using a more detailed version of the slide deck above. 
 An investor who attended one of those pitch meetings in March 2019 says that Honestbee was trying to raise a US$150 million round that would value the company at US$900 million post-funding. 
 “Secretive and shady” 
 But Joel Sng, the company’s CEO at the time, was hardly involved. Instead, Honestbee only sent a couple of junior employees who were barely out of college to the meeting. 
 “Such a massive round, and the founder didn’t want to make the trip down – it’s a sign of disrespect,” says the investor, who declined to be named. 
 Typically, companies with a valuation close to or over US$1 billion would have their finances scrutinized when they’re fundraising. However, Honestbee appeared “secretive and shady” about its numbers, according to the source, who works at a fund belonging to a large Singaporean corporation. 
 “They were unwilling to disclose what multiples we were getting into,” he observes. Whatever numbers the startup did share also didn’t add up: Honestbee said it had an annual gross merchandise value of US$132 million, which didn’t justify the valuation it sought. 
 Creating FOMO 
 Honestbee’s representatives hinted that an “undisclosed mega fund from Japan” was coming into the round, but they didn’t want to reveal the name, recalls the investor. When he asked if it was SoftBank, he saw their facial expressions change. 
 “I mean, there’s only a few mega funds in Japan,” he adds. “It was a way to create [a feeling of] FOMO (fear of missing out).” 
 Following that encounter, the Honestbee team pursued the source’s investment firm over email. Despite that, the investor was never connected to Sng or the management team. 
 An employee with knowledge of the fundraising confirms that apart from one possible occasion, Sng wasn’t present either when the company pitched to other well-known investors. 
 At best, Honestbee would send in Roger Koh, Sng’s then right-hand man, to those meetings. 
 By around April 2019, as Honestbee’s fundraising efforts faltered, it received a US$10 million offer from regional super app Grab in exchange for its technology, intellectual property, data, and some of its employees. Sng rejected the deal, which would have meant that Honestbee had to shut down. He and the team felt the company could still be salvaged. 
 “He was too arrogant. He really believed his own bullshit,” the ex-employee points out.

643382,East Ventures-backed food ordering app exits Indonesia due to Covid-19," Eatsy, a Singapore-based restaurant ordering and payment app, will stop its Indonesian operations on April 1, 2020. In an announcement on its app, the company says that it took the decision amid the worsening Covid-19 pandemic. 
 “The spread of Covid-19 pandemic has affected all business lines, including Eatsy,” the company said in Bahasa. “With a heavy heart, we decided to stop Eatsy Indonesia’s operations.”

 Eatsy just  officially entered the Indonesia market  in November last year. It allows users to order ahead food from restaurants without having to wait in line. Gojek and Grab also  launched a similar service  in January this year. 
 Eatsy was founded in 2016 by Shaun Heng with a mission to empower small and medium-sized businesses in the food and beverage industry, helping them gain a competitive edge by leveraging existing technology infrastructure. According to Crunchbase, the company has to date raised US$1 million in funding by East Ventures and Quest Ventures. 
 Covid-19 has impacted startups and tech companies across the world,  especially those operating in the travel industry . Some companies are also  in danger of running out of cash  as the outbreak sours investor appetite and slows fundraising activities.

643314,Zomato employees take voluntary pay cuts amid Covid-19 outbreak," Hundreds of Zomato employees have taken deep voluntary salary cuts to help conserve the company’s cash flow amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal  said  on Twitter.

 India this week has imposed a nationwide 21-day  lockdown  to curb the spread of the disease. The number of confirmed cases in the country has already crossed 500. 
 “Dining out in many countries is badly hit,” Goyal said, adding that “thousands of restaurants have been severely hit because of their immobilized workforce due to the lockdown.” 
 Aside from the salary cuts, Zomato will facilitate loans for its food delivery and restaurant partners. 
 It will also give a free two-month membership extension for its premium Zomato Gold members in India, the UAE, Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Lebanon, Turkey, New Zealand, Portugal, and Qatar. 
 To make up for the lost earnings of its delivery partners, the startup is creating a fund. “We are also donating for our delivery partner fund, as well as Feed the Daily Wager campaign, to support the community during these times,” Goyal said. “We also hope that we get government support to help us with this.” 
 Zomato’s rival, Swiggy, said it is  working  with local governments to remain operational and extend its support especially to customers in need. 
 Earlier this year, Zomato  acquired  Uber’s food delivery business in India, becoming one of the largest food delivery companies in the country. Zomato and Swiggy now control about 80% of the market. 
 Outside of India, Indonesian unicorn Gojek has also created a  US$6 million fund  to support all its drivers, merchants, and partners. The company’s co-CEOs and senior management team will donate 25% of their annual salary to support the fund.

630659,Future Indonesia: How Tokopedia uses the cloud to make online shopping more seamless,"   ﻿   
 (Additional reporting by  Nathaniel Fetalvero ) 
 Valued at over  US$7 billion ,  Tokopedia  has earned its place as Indonesia’s largest online marketplace. Since its inception, the Jakarta-based unicorn has raised  US$2.4 billion of disclosed funding  and has over  90 million monthly active users and 6.2 million merchants  on its platform. 
 On top of its ecommerce business, the company has launched several fintech initiatives, partnering with other local startups like  digital wallet firm Ovo  and  peer-to-peer lending platform Funding Societies . While Tokopedia began with selling physical goods, it has now expanded to also offer digital services like bill payments and flight and train-ticket booking. 
 However, the company faces challenges in providing a seamless online experience during times of high traffic, thanks to its large user base and breadth of features. 
 Seamless shopping 
 In 2018, Tokopedia organized Ramadan Ekstra, a televised program that extended special deals to Indonesian shoppers during the Islamic holy month. 
 The event attracted  73 million visitors to the online marketplace , exceeding the company’s expectations. The increased traffic overloaded Tokopedia’s servers, which meant some shoppers had to deal with a slower platform. 
 “Imagine you organize a party for 100 people, and then you have 200 or 300 people show up. Even if they have a good time, you know that you could’ve done better,” explains Tahir Hashmi, the firm’s vice president of engineering. 
 That’s why for last year’s iteration of Ramadan Ekstra, Tokopedia worked with cloud technology service provider  Alibaba Cloud  to review its architecture, streamline unoptimized queries, and ensure that its systems were top-notch. 
 Alibaba Cloud’s  ApsaraDB for RDS  tool, for instance, provided Tokopedia’s engineers with a full range of solutions from backup and recovery to diversified data storage. This helped the firm maintain its responsiveness to queries, even with high amounts of traffic. 
 The collaboration paid off: Ramadan Ekstra 2019 achieved a  gross merchandise volume of US$1.3 billion in a single month  and reached 97% of districts in Indonesia. The daily transaction value it recorded on May 17 also surpassed the total amount that Tokopedia earned in its first six years as a business. 
 “What’s beautiful is that the experience [for our customers] was very seamless and smooth,” adds Herman Widjaja, senior vice president of engineering at Tokopedia. 
 Enabling innovation 
 Aside from allowing the firm to offer a better user experience, Hashmi says Alibaba Cloud’s services also helped Tokopedia’s engineers to “focus more on product improvement and feature enhancement, and less on the operations.” 
 For example, one functionality the team was able to develop was image-based searches. 
 “In a developing economy, and especially considering how consumption patterns change, doing a text-based search is really good – it’s really important – but it’s not enough,” says the executive. 
 By leveraging Alibaba Cloud’s image search library, customers can now simply take a picture of an item they like, upload the photo on Tokopedia’s marketplace, and find it on the platform to purchase. 
 “We continue exchanging ideas, and based on our brainstorming, we are able to develop innovative solutions,” says Widjaja. 
 
 This entry is part of the  Future Indonesia  series, which showcases how the digital transformation of Indonesian businesses is enabled by the use of cloud technology.

643288,Myanmar baby products e-tailer built by ex-Garena staff gets funding," While the Covid-19 outbreak is putting some investments on hold,  Kyarlay , an ecommerce platform in Myanmar that sells and delivers baby products, announced it just secured US$750,000 in funding. 
 The fresh capital came from VC firm Emerging Markets Entrpreneurs (EME) and investment management firm United Managers Japan. 
 
  Photo credit: EME 
 
 Husband and wife Soe Lin Myat and Nang Mo, who both previously worked at gaming firm Garena, built Kyarlay in 2017 while expecting their first child. At that time, they realized that there was a big opportunity to make shopping for baby products in Myanmar more convenient. 
 “In Yangon, forgetting something as simple as milk powder can easily mean a one-hour roundtrip back to the store. We experienced this frustration and saw that we had the skills to address it,” Nang Mo shared. 
 Soe Lin Myat also runs Momolay, a mobile-first entertainment app, which he launched in 2015. 
 Kyarlay’s two stores, which double as fulfillment centers, are open seven days a week. 
 The company’s app and website feature content from local pediatricians and obstetricians as well as promos and other initiatives that help parents engage with one another. According to a statement, it’s by this community that the startup learns more about their customers. 
 Recently, Kyarlay also rolled out its four-hour delivery service and its own branded products. 
 The startup now looks to open more stores, build out its delivery network, and provide additional products. “Once we can serve the whole of Yangon with competitively priced, high-quality products, then we’ll start branching out further,” Nang Mo said. 
 According to a  report , the ecommerce market in Myanmar is still at a nascent stage, at just US$6 million. Facebook takes up over 85% of the internet traffic, which means a lot of online shopping happens on social media. However, ecommerce startups are optimistic about the market growth, given the country’s high mobile and internet usage.

643223,Singapore robo-advisory startup Smartly winds down operations," Singapore-based robo-advisor  Smartly  said it is winding down the operations of its platform as competition in the space heats up. 
 “Competition in the digital investment advisory space is intense, and maintaining a high service standard on the platform has been challenging,” the company said in an announcement on its website. 
 
  Photo credit: Unsplash 
 
 Smartly, founded in 2015, charged a 1% annual management fee for accounts under S$10,000, 0.7% for accounts over S$10,000, and 0.5% for accounts over S$100,000. The average rate for the industry is 2.5% per year for any account size, with additional fees. 
 The startup said it initially considered making core platform improvements, but Vietnamese investment management firm VinaCapital Group, which  acquired  Smartly in 2019, ultimately guided the decision to shut down. 
 The startup was up against the likes of StashAway, AutoWealth, Kristal, and GrabInvest. 
 StashAway last year raised  US$12 million  in a series B round led by Eight Roads Ventures, while Kristal secured  US$6 million  in a series A round earlier this year to expand to the Asia-Pacific and Middle East markets. 
 Last month, ride-hailing giant Grab entered the space by  acquiring  robo-advisory startup Bento Invest (now GrabInvest) to offer retail wealth management and investment solutions to users, drivers, and merchants across the region. 
 Traditional banks have also joined the competition. In 2018, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) launched a bank-based robo-advisory service called  OCBC RoboInvest . Last year, DBS bank also rolled out digiPortfolio, a hybrid human-robo investment platform. 
 According to Statista, assets under management in the robo-advisor segment reached US$1.4 billion in 2020, and it’s expected to reach around  US$2.6 billion  by 2023. The number of people using robo-advisors is projected to reach 147 million in the same period. 
  Hong Kong and Singapore  are key robo-advisory markets in Asia Pacific, according to Deloitte. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(3, 0.9994997)]","['AutoWealth', 'OCBC', 'Kristal', 'GrabInvest', 'StashAway', 'Deloitte']",['Singapore']

 Both Facebook and Reliance Industries declined to comment.

 Jio, valued at more than US$60 billion according to estimates by analysts, has received over US$25 million from Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries. 
 The company has become the top telco in India with over 370 million subscribers, which might be one of the reasons for the deal, the report said. 
 According to   Livemint  , India seems to be a significant market for the social network, as its messaging app, WhatsApp, has 400 million users in the country. However, the market may be difficult to enter given the government’s proposed restrictions on personal data for overseas companies. 
 Facebook also previously attempted to offer a free internet service, Free Basics, in India but it failed. In 2017, it expanded its Express Wi-Fi service in the country to let users log on to a Wi-Fi network hosted by local partners, but the project’s potential and scale  haven’t been promising . 
 Starting commercial operations in 2016, Jio thrived in the local telco scene with competitive offers. Its other services include music streaming, on-demand live TV, and payments. 
 Earlier this year, Jio and Reliance Retail jointly launched an ecommerce platform called  JioMart  as their parent company bets on the online food and grocery space. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(0, 0.800744), (1, 0.19898182)]","['Facebook', 'app', 'WhatsApp']",['India']
643159,Commentary: Should Sea sell Shopee and focus on Garena?," The full year 2019 financial results recently released by New York-listed Sea Ltd highlights the extreme performance disparity between its online gaming unit Garena and ecommerce business Shopee. 
 While Garena has become highly profitable, Shopee has been burning a lot of cash. It might be in the Singapore-based Sea’s best interest to divide itself into two companies so that Garena can reach its full potential. 
 To be clear, Shopee has established a leading position in Southeast Asia’s ecommerce space, and it’s among the top five most downloaded apps in the region according to App Annie. It has also been busy creating revenue: Shopee’s gross merchandise volume (GMV) soared 71% to US$17.6 billion in 2019. Adjusted revenue leapt 224% to US$942 million as the company increasingly monetized its GMV. 
   Photo credit: Sea Group  
 Taken together, this data presents a picture of a thriving business. However, Shopee has also lost US$1 billion in  EBITDA  on an adjusted basis during the year. The company also earned a negative gross margin, which indicates that it could be subsidizing product sales to obtain market share and boost its revenue. 
 Going gangbusters 
 In contrast, the latest financial results highlighted how Garena, Sea’s original video game business that existed before Shopee, is going gangbusters. 
 Garena’s 2019 revenue jumped 172% to US$1.8 billion, and it generated US$1 billion of EBITDA on an adjusted basis. 
 This is not only a huge number in absolute terms but also represents a 40% EBITDA profit margin. Should Shopee eventually become profitable, its margins probably won’t come close to Garena’s. Garena is killing it, but it’s essentially fully bankrolling Shopee right now, as implied during the company’s recent earnings call. 
    Figures in US million dollars   Sources: Sea, Zero One  
 Garena’s cash flow should not be financing Shopee. That’s not an optimal allocation of shareholder capital based on the performance of the two businesses. 
 For example, Shopee reported US$765 million in sales and marketing expenses during 2019 – all to generate US$942 million of revenue and lose US$1 billion of EBITDA. Meanwhile, Garena spent just US$109 million of sales and marketing expenses, and yet it achieved US$1.8 billion of sales and yielded a positive US$1 billion of EBITDA. 
 Back-of-the-envelope math shows substantially higher returns on capital invested into growing Garena versus Shopee.  Tech in Asia  reached out to Sea, but it declined to comment on this analysis. 
 The accepted premise in the ecommerce game is that players usually have to lose a lot of money over many years to eventually gain dominance and win. As such, Shopee’s continuing losses is understandable. Part of Sea’s long-term growth strategy is to leverage its ecommerce business to offer not just payments services but an entire suite of financial services should – assuming it secures a much-coveted  digital bank license in Singapore . This would naturally entail more capital investment. 
 Injecting more capital into Shopee would only make sense if it were Sea’s sole business. However, Sea also has Garena, a rapidly growing business with high profit margins that represents the company’s origins and core competencies. 
 Major moneymaker 
 If Garena were a mature legacy business, then it would be practical to invest cash flow from an existing “cash cow” into a new high-growth venture like Shopee. But Garena isn’t a boring old business. It is a major moneymaker that still has massive growth potential, and each dollar spent on Garena earns far more than what Sea earns by putting the same amount into Shopee. So just imagine what a giant Garena could be if it reinvested all of its cash generation back into itself instead of subsidizing Shopee. 
 
  Photo credit: Garena 
 
 Perhaps investment bankers and the market itself previously found Garena less sexy than Shopee. And when Sea did its  initial public offering in 2017 , Shopee probably made for a good story, giving Sea a reason to raise capital. 
 After all, Garena can grow without much capital and it has done so while having to prop up its loss-making sibling. At the same time, though, Garena can’t become a bigger company because its cash flow keeps being diverted into Shopee. 
 So yes, Sea’s strategy has worked so far and it has also been appealing to investors, particularly back when ecommerce land grabs were more attractive than video game development. But times are changing, with investors increasingly demanding that startups focus on profitability following the  WeWork fiasco , which saw the co-working space operator shelving its IPO in October 2019 and scrambling to raise capital. 
 Garena surprise 
 Garena may have surprised Sea’s management with how well it has performed despite receiving just a fraction of Shopee’s operating expenses. Today, esports and branded-content creation have become much more popular in the tech world. 
 If Sea can redirect Garena’s immense cash flow, then it can focus on building one of the best gaming content companies in the world. Going beyond Southeast Asia, it could enter markets like Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Russia instead of going head-to-head with competitors in the U.S. or Europe. 
 Despite Sea’s success, it’s fair to question whether the use of funds between Garena and Shopee adds up. And if Sea were a more mature listed company, an activist hedge fund type could even come in at some point and shake things up to split the business in two. 
 To put it another way, what if Sea spun off Garena and Shopee and you could choose to fully own shares in one of the new  entities? Which one would you prefer to get? Based on the numbers, I’d take Garena hands down. 
 So while Shopee has made tremendous gains on many fronts, maybe Sea should just sell it while it’s ahead to someone else such as Tencent. Then it can refocus on Garena, the business that gives the strongest long-term opportunity for Sea shareholders. Or Sea can just become two standalone companies so that Garena can realize its full potential and Shopee will be forced to support itself completely. This would also be beneficial to Sea’s shareholders.

643166,Hmlet co-founder exits startup amid strategic overhaul," Singapore-based co-living operator  Hmlet  confirmed that its co-founder, Zenos Schmickrath, has left the startup to pursue other opportunities as the company undergoes a major overhaul. 
 Hmlet said Schmickrath left in December 2019 but remains as a shareholder.

 The development comes as the company switched to an asset-light model by helping landlords run Hmlet-branded co-living spaces. Previously, the startup directly leased properties from landlords and real estate firms, then renovated them to maximize living spaces. 
 “In this regard, we have had to hire a number of professionals over the last two quarters to fuel this shift, while parting ways with a handful of members, including Zenos, our co-founder,” Hmlet CEO and co-founder Yoan Kamalski told  Tech in Asia  in an emailed statement. 
 Kamalski previously told  Tech in Asia  that it had  retrenched  roughly 10% of its staff, as their roles had become redundant. The actual number, however, could be higher and that the layoffs had started in December last year, said a source familiar with the situation. At that time, the startup did not confirm the identities of those who were let go. 
 The CEO noted that the startup intends to hire “a lot more than we’ve had to let go.” 
 Kamalski and Schmickrath started Hmlet in 2016, renting out properties in the city centers of Singapore and Tokyo. It has raised a total of US$48 million in funding to date, according to data from Crunchbase. 
 Its biggest top-up came in July 2019 at  US$40 million  for its series B round, which was led by Burda Principal Investments.

642937,Road to profitability: Insights into Southeast Asia’s VC investments," At the recent demo day for Mobile Only Accelerator (MOX), managing partner William Bao Bean moderated a panel discussion with Kuo-Yi Lim,  co-founder and managing partner at Monk’s Hill Ventures, and Sachin Bhanot, a principal at B Capital Group. MOX is a mobile-first, mobile-only program under venture capital firm SOSV, where Bao Bean is a general partner. 
   
The panelists spoke about VC investment trends in Southeast Asia, fundraising advice, and lessons learned from their investing careers. Following SoftBank’s day of reckoning, investors are now becoming bullish on positive unit economics. 
 Here’s their advice for achieving profitability and surviving challenging times. 
 Study India and China for hybrid models 
 “One benefit of Southeast Asia is really the benefit of hindsight,” Bhanot said, observing that startups in the region have been fast in learning from other markets and aggressive in reiterating on their experiments. 
 While Southeast Asia has long been known for “copycat” business models, recent years have seen the emergence of “mutant” models that are imported but highly customized to local markets. 
 “We’re seeing interesting hybrid models in India and China now playing out in markets such as Indonesia and Vietnam,” Bhanot explained. Similarities between mobile-first and mobile-only markets in India, China, and Southeast Asia are also conducive to cross-border opportunities. 
 “Seeing interesting models that emerged in India and China, we can then conduct lots of pattern-matching to see what could potentially work here and what couldn’t,” he said. For example, while business-to-consumer ecommerce is very well-defined in ares with large populations, the firm has seen an uptake in interest in business-to-business ecommerce. 
 As markets such as Indonesia and Vietnam are still fragmented and disorganized, the pain points are very real. People in the city don’t have access to goods and struggle with financing, suppliers, and logistics. These challenges are being solved in India and China, which might hold the answer for Southeast Asia. 
 Provide cross-border solutions 
 Bao Bean himself has been investing in Southeast Asia, China, and India for nearly two decades – first with SoftBank China &amp; India Holdings, then with Singapore-based SingTel Innov8, and now with SOSV. Managing two accelerators that together sustain a global cross-border ecosystem, he’s seen his fair share of hybrid successes and failures. 
 “If you look at sectors such as fintech, media, ecommerce, social commerce, healthtech, and education, people across markets tend to have similar types of problems – especially when they are on US$50 to US$200 Android phones, getting online for the first time,” said Bao Bean. 
 According to the executive, consumer mobile startups in India, Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia and South Asia can take advantage of the massive opportunities created by cheap internet and smartphones. 
 Brace for capital winter 
 With the emergence of series B to C funds in Southeast Asia, Monk’s Hill Ventures’ Lim advised startups to be cautious. 
 WeWork’s botched initial public offering has had an impact on what venture capital firms are looking for. While the VC industry is spreading cautionary tales about the downfall of growth-at-any-cost companies, founders must have a sobering look at their scaling strategy. 
 “It’s quite clear now that investors are looking for solid, core fundamentals in the businesses,” he emphasized. “Don’t take the capital available for granted. Series Cs and Ds are going to be a lot harder in the next three years.” 
 Look for the margins, grow the margins 
 The novel coronavirus outbreak has presented unprecedented challenges on all fronts: remote work, disruption in supply chains, fundraising, and market expansion, just to name a few. It also forces companies worldwide to be ruthlessly efficient. “For better or for worse, this virus saga is going to put your company to the test. How resilient is your business?” Lim said. 
 Unit economics is important, he stressed, saying that one of his portfolio companies recently lost 50% of its revenue in one month. 
 “If your cost is 70% of the revenue, then you’re in trouble. Build resilience into the business. Fundamentally, it needs to be able to stand on its own. Look for the margins, and grow the margins,” he said. 
 Embed your product into existing value chains 
 In January, B Capital invested in Bangalore-based micromobility platform Bounce, which operates more than 20,000 dockless bikes and scooters in India. 
 The company partners with mom and pop store owners and local merchants in each city. 
 “These micro-entrepreneurs deploy their own bikes and scooters. They are still using our app and are part of the Bounce platform, but they don’t have to be locked into our scooter ecosystem,” Bounce co-founder Vivekananda Hallekere told reporters previously. 
 By embedding the product into the existing value chain of people who bike to work or school on a daily basis, Bounce can scale in India in a sustainable way from a unit economics standpoint, Bhanot explained. 
 Capitalize on inefficiency and unreasonable margins 
 With regard to Monk’s Hill Ventures’ investment philosophy, Lim said that he “looks for traditional business models with unreasonable margins.” Glints, a tech-enabled recruitment platform the firm invested in, is one example. HR recruiting agents typically charge large fees and drive quite a high margin on transactions. On Glints’ platform, agents who were making one to two matches per month can now make five to six times more matches using its technology.

643155,Gojek top execs to donate 25% of annual salary to drivers amid Covid-19 crisis," Indonesian unicorn Gojek has created a US$6 million fund to support all drivers, merchants, and other partners across the region whose income has been affected amid the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 The Gojek Partner Support Fund has three sources. Gojek co-CEOs and senior management will donate 25% of their annual salary over the next 12 months, while the company’s annual salary increase budget will be redirected to the fund. Corporate partners will also donate, according to a statement.

 “At Gojek, the pandemic has prompted us to work from home, forced us to conduct business differently, and disrupted our regular working rhythm,” Gojek co-CEOs Andre Soelistyo and Kevin Aluwi said. “But our problems pale in comparison to the hardships the coronavirus is likely to place on our driver partners, whose livelihoods depend on an economy that is experiencing a significant slowdown.” 
 The company said the fund intends to support the families of Gojek drivers and merchants as they wait for the situation to improve. It will be carried out through a new foundation called the Anak Bangsa Bisa Foundation, which would work with governments, civil society groups, and driver associations. 
 Gojek said it currently has over 2 million drivers and operates across 207 cities in five Southeast Asian countries. 
 Apart from the fund, Gojek also recently formed a partnership with Halodoc, an Indonesian healthtech startup, to launch a free online medical consultation service called Check Covid-19. Through the service, people experiencing potential Covid-19 symptoms can instantly get medical advice from a doctor. 
 Meanwhile, other ride-hailing companies are also implementing measures to support their drivers during this period. Gojek rival Grab set up a Special Relief Fund to support driver partners who are diagnosed, hospitalized, quarantined, or under leave of absence due to Covid-19. 
 India’s Ola is waiving lease rentals for driver partners who are currently in distress due to the temporary lockdown in the country. Ola and Uber have also  suspended  their ride-sharing services in India as Covid-19 cases continue to increase in the country. 
 In the US, Uber launched a global financial assistance plan to support drivers and delivery people who are diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed in quarantine by the authorities. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(3, 0.9996772)]","['Gojek', 'Halodoc', 'Ola']","['US', 'India']"
643148,Indian e-grocers worry about service disruption as country goes on lockdown," 
 The number of  Covid-19 cases in India has crossed 500 , resulting in an unprecedented increase in demand for grocery products. 
 With 30 out of a total 36 states and union territories going under either complete or partial lockdown in the country until March 31, people fear there will be a shortage of supplies even though Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on March 19, said there is no need for panic buying and that there would be no shortage of everyday essential items. 
 However, almost all online grocery companies, including BigBasket, Grofers, Swiggy Store, and Dunzo, overwhelmed by rapidly surging orders, have been struggling to make the deliveries.

 Grofers co-founder  Albinder Dhindsa had to take it to Twitter  after consignments in Faridabad near Delhi were stopped by authorities. “Our [Grofers] warehouse in Faridabad was closed by local law enforcement today. While we understand they are doing their duty, essential items will be denied to 20,000+ households in Faridabad and Delhi every day. We need help in sorting this out.” 
 A person who did not wish to come on record said she has downloaded almost all online grocery apps – from Grofers, BigBasket, and Swiggy to DailyNinja – but none are serviceable in her area in Bengaluru. All the grocery stores in her neighborhood are shut. 
 The severity of the situation can be gauged by the fact that Bengaluru-based online grocer BigBasket is not in a position to take any orders from new customers and is only delivering goods to its regular customers. Another Bengaluru resident, whose last order at BigBasket was last year, was denied service as she is not a regular customer. 
 We have reached out to BigBasket to understand how it’s dealing with the rise in orders and will update the article once we hear from the company. 
 Food delivery major Swiggy, which delivers groceries in Bengaluru and Gurugram, is also facing challenges in fulfilling orders. “Almost all grocery chain stores are closed and we are relying on small neighborhood stores to ensure people get their daily essential products,” a Swiggy executive told  KrAsia.  The Swiggy employee who did not wish to be named said even though grocery delivery comes under essential business category and is legally allowed to operate, local authorities on the ground are implementing their own rules. 
 According to an  Entrackr  report, Milkbasket’s employees are not being let go for delivery by local police authorities. 
 “Local authorities do not listen to vendors, don’t understand where they are going. On Hero Honda chowk (Gurugram), our 10 vehicles carrying milk were stopped on Monday. The authorities did not let them go. Hyderabad was completely locked down where we faced a 100% loss. While Bangalore and Gurugram were at 20% loss, Noida faced 10% loss,” Anant Goel, CEO of Milkbasket, told  Entrackr . 
 Meanwhile, Reliance Retail, the retail arm of one of India’s biggest companies, Reliance Industries, said it will ensure there are enough supplies of all necessary products such as staples, dairy, fruits, and vegetables. The company operates a network of 736 grocery chain stores across the country. 
 According to an   Economic Times   report, Reliance Retail is preparing for a pickup facility for users to ensure minimum touchpoints and interaction with its staff members.

643090,Waste management startup Blue Planet secures $25m from Japan’s Nomura," By the end of 2030, Asia will account for  more than half  of the world’s middle-class consumption. Managing solid waste, particularly plastic and organic waste, is becoming a key challenge for the developing nations in the region, Singapore-based waste management company  Blue Planet Environmental Solutions  said. 
 Blue Planet today announced that it has raised US$25 million from Japanese investment bank Nomura to invest more in sustainable solutions.

 The company, which was established in 2017, uses technology and IP-based end-to-end waste management solutions to separate and upcycle waste into commercially valuable products. 
 Blue Planet’s services include converting organic waste into energy and compost, converting single-use plastics to fuel oil, recycling geopolymer concrete blocks made from inert waste, and recovering precious metals from electronic waste using a non-hazardous chemical process. 
 It does all of these with the help of companies it has acquired in the past 17 months. These include Malaysia-based Globecycle Holding for industrial waste, Rudra Environmental Solutions for plastic waste, Yasasu Environmental Management Services for mixed municipal waste, India-based Xeon Waste Managers for organic waste, Virtus Concrete Solutions for inert waste, and UK-based Smart Creative Technologies for electronic waste. 
 “The recent investment by Nomura will help Blue Planet expand our products and services and provide circular economy solutions for sustainable waste management,” said Madhujeet Chimni, co-founder of Blue Planet. 
 Aadit Seshasayee, head of Nomura Loans and Principal Investments in Asia, said that the investment is in line with Nomura’s focus on environmental, social, and governance opportunities. 
 According to the United Nations, Asia is falling behind in three key  sustainable development goals , namely clean water and sanitation, decent work and economic growth, and responsible consumption and production. Blue Planet aims to help organizations and countries improve in these areas. 
 The company previously received investments from Malaysia-based OSK Ventures and private equity Neev Fund, which is backed by the State Bank of India and the UK’s Department for International Development.

 The platform supports online conferences of up to 300 attendees free of charge and includes features such as online document collaboration and screen sharing. 
 “With the mounting number of new Covid-19 cases outside of China, we look forward to providing our users in other countries and regions with the capabilities to work remotely,” said Lori Wu, vice president of Tencent Cloud in a statement provided to  KrAsia . “As we move forward, we plan to roll out the service across the world in compliance with local regulations.” 
 Telecommuting services like Tencent Meeting, Bytedance’s Feishu Meeting, and Alibaba’s DingTalk have become household names as China’s response to the new coronavirus led to millions of people working and studying from home. Tencent Meeting and DingTalk both encountered server crashes due to the surge in demand. 
 While it is too early to foretell the extent that work-from-home platforms will be used outside of China, the opportunity for such technology appears to be widening as more and more countries enforce lockdowns and quarantine measures to stem the coronavirus outbreak. 
 For example, collaborative tools including Zoom, Slack, and Microsoft Teams have also seen downloads skyrocket over the past few weeks. According to mobile apps tracker Apptopia, Zoom gained nearly 600,000 new installs on March 22 alone – its biggest day ever.

643111,Honestbee starts legal action against ex-CEO and ex-director," Amid  mass layoffs  and the shutdown of its supermarket, Honestbee announced that it has sought legal advice and sent letters of demand to ex-CEO Joel Sng and ex-director Jeffrey Wong over alleged breach of fiduciary duties. 
   
 The company has been investigating transactions that Sng entered into when he and Wong were still at Honestbee. 
 In a press release, the startup said it has “discovered numerous irregularities that call for further investigation.” The said probe and questionable transactions were  first reported by  Tech in Asia  . 
 At the center of the investigation are three events: 
 House in Japan 
 In December 2015, Sng bought a house in Niseko, Japan under his name. On his instructions, the company paid US$1.1 million for the property and covered its maintenance costs. 
 According to Honestbee, the company did not derive any “real benefit” or “commercial advantage” from the property purchase. 
 In February 2018, Sng “attempted belatedly to regularize” the purchase by creating an agreement, stating that the company had appointed him to act on its behalf three years prior. 
 The purchase was not disclosed to the board or to the shareholders until September 2018, Honestbee claims. 
 Unused commercial space 
 In May 2013, Sng and Wong started a company called The Cub SG Pte Ltd. Sng owned 70% of that company, while Wong owned the rest. 
 In October 2017, The Cub rented a space in the same venue as Habitat, the supermarket Honestbee used to operate. 
 On behalf of The Cub, Honestbee paid for the costs of renting the property, including the deposit, monthly rental, and renovation. The monthly rent and expenses amounted to about US$422,000. 
 Sng did not disclose the arrangement until September 2018. 
 Sng’s company 
 Sng incorporated PayNow Pte Ltd in January 2017 with the purported goal of developing an e-wallet. 
 He claimed that PayNow had a viable product that was ready for launch, noting that the company was worth around US$2.7 million. 
 Over a period of time, Honestbee paid about US$5.4 million to own PayNow. Some of the payments were found to be made on Sng’s instructions. 
 “It is believed that the above transactions have caused loss and damage to [Honestbee],” the company said. 
 That’s not all 
 Sng has been known to spend Honestbee’s funds extravagantly when he was CEO, sources familiar with the company told  Tech in Asia.  
 The ex-CEO was known to stay in lavish hotels, fly business class, and make expensive entertainment claims, which can run up to thousands of US dollars per sitting. Meanwhile, other members of the senior management team flew on budget and stayed in cheap accommodations. 
 Sng had rented apartments in various cities and asked the finance team to expense luxury items. 
 “The breaches outlined above are non-exhaustive and based on the company’s ongoing internal investigations to date,” Honestbee said. “The company has not received any substantive response from either Sng or Wong.” ",Terence Lee,1,2,"[(0, 0.9997871)]","['Cub', 'Habitat', 'House']","['Asia', 'Japan', 'Niseko']"
643089,Indian online grocer BigBasket acquires milk delivery startup DailyNinja," Bengaluru-based online grocer  BigBasket  said it has fully acquired local milk delivery app  DailyNinja  to further expand Bbdaily, its micro delivery business focused on daily essentials like milk and bread. 
 Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.

 Founded in 2015, DailyNinja provides a hyperlocal delivery platform for daily needs. It operates on a subscription model, offering options for monthly or weekly deliveries. 
 While it focuses on milk, the startup also delivers food, grocery items, personal care goods, and medical products. 
 Bbdaily, on the other hand, currently makes about 160,000 deliveries per day, according to a statement. It delivers fresh fruits and vegetables, bread, dairy products, eggs, and other daily essentials like breakfast cereals, tender coconut, personal care, and baby care products, among others. 
 With the acquisition, BigBasket will be able to tap into DailyNinja’s current daily customer base of around 110,000. The online grocery major now also has access to DailyNinja’s network of 2,000 milkmen spread across India. 
 BigBasket said it has been focusing on expanding its subscription business to deliver daily essentials at lower costs. DailyNinja’s addition will enable the company to grow Bbdaily by 150% to 200% over the next 12 months, BigBasket claims. 
 The company’s co-founder and CEO, Hari Menon, said that the company plans to “improve delivery productivity and achieve breakeven much sooner than planned.” 
 Meanwhile, DailyNinja expects to grow its business twofold within a month as it leverages Bbdaily’s supply chain capabilities and range of non-milk products. 
 Last week, it was reported that restaurant discovery app Zomato was in talks with BigBasket and its online supermarket peer Grofers about a possible  grocery delivery tie-up . 
 The development comes at a time when food delivery orders trend down, and demand for grocery deliveries sees an uptick amid the Covid-19 outbreak. 
 Tentatively called Zomato Market, the new feature is expected to be rolled out sometime this week, according to reports. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(1, 0.99960494)]","['DailyNinja', 'Bengaluru', 'Grofers', 'BigBasket', 'Bbdaily']","['Zomato', 'India']"
643049,Singapore VC firm Expara to invest in startups combating Covid-19," As the number of Covid-19 cases continues to increase globally, Singapore-based  Expara Ventures  has launched a new accelerator program to support startups developing solutions to the new challenges brought by the outbreak.

 The early-stage VC firm and startup enabler said it is now accepting applications for its Expara VirTech Global Accelerator. The three-month online program is set to back 30 companies from all around the world, providing mentorship services and funding of up to US$50,000. 
 No face-to-face interaction will be required, and the demo day will be held online, according to a statement. 
 Expara said potential areas of interest for the accelerator include solutions for detecting the virus, tools that share information about pandemics, solutions that help protect people and slow down the spread of the virus, and services that can improve life quality and work efficiency during and after global pandemics. 
 Interested startups may apply until April 30 this year. 
 “Governments and corporates are struggling against the virus, and Expara wants to invite entrepreneurs and startups to join the battle,” Expara CEO Douglas Abrams said. 
 Abrams, who has over 20 years of experience in investing and teaching in Singapore, established Expara Ventures in 2003. Since then, the company has launched five VC funds and has invested in more than 80 startups. 
 It also runs two incubator programs – Expara IDM Ventures and Expara IDM Ventures II – as well as Extream Ventures, a communications- and internet-focused joint fund with Upstream.

642289,"TIA Monthly Funding Report: Grab, India are bright spots in an otherwise brutal February","     
 ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
 February has been a tough month for Asian funding. 
 But let’s start with the good news. India is doing well once again, propped up by large deals for babycare startup FirstCry, education tech firm Byju’s, and online lender Rupeek. Meanwhile, Grab announced a mega US$850 million deal. 
 These deals mask another downer of a month – dealmaking dropped 26% from the same month last year. Chinese investments are down by more than half over the same period. 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
 We may be seeing proof of Covid-19’s impact on the tech investment scene. In fact,  80% of startups  told us in a survey that they’ve been affected by the rapid spread of the disease, validating anecdotes we’re hearing from startups about withdrawn term sheets and near-empty cash reserves. 
 The numbers for February continue the decline observed in  January , back when the effects of Covid-19 weren’t apparent yet. 
 The prospects for March may not improve. So far, there’s been sharp drop in oil prices, which sent shockwaves through the global economy. Covid-19 shows no signs of dying down – it’s now spreading unabated in the US and Europe. 
 In short, we’re just getting right into the thick of it.

642894,The benefits and challenges of integrating security into the software delivery lifecycle," In September 2017, US consumer credit reporting agency Equifax announced a massive data breach that affected 147 million consumers. Sensitive information such as names, social security numbers, and dates of birth, credit card and driver’s license data fell into the hands of hackers. Equifax  ended up having to pay US$700 million to settle federal and state investigations  and a further US$425 million in compensation to affected customers. It was one of the largest cybersecurity incidents in history. 
 The root of the breach was Equifax’s failure to patch –  a known vulnerability in open-source web application framework Apache Struts . In addition, the investigation report found that there was an “execution gap between IT policy development and operation.” This suggests that the agency’s engineering, operations, and security teams did not integrate operational or security practices into the development workflows or application life cycles, which is a major DevOps security issue. 
 Instead of leaving themselves open to such incidents, companies should integrate security as a major part of their DevOps philosophy and factor it into the software development process. 
 That said, there are challenges that go with the benefits of this approach, so it’s wise to take a look at both sides of the coin. 
 What is DevOps? 
 It turns out that DevOps itself can be rather hard to explain. “There’s been a few misinterpretations of it, and it’s a very loose definition in many ways,” says Nigel Kersten, field chief technology officer of US automation software company  Puppet . Part of that confusion might come down to its extremely broad definition. 
 
   Nigel Kersten, field chief technology officer at Puppet / Photo credit: Puppet  
 
 At its core, DevOps takes software engineering principles and best practices and applies them to the entire software delivery cycle. This affects how the process plays out, involving shifts in the way security, infrastructure, operations, management, and change management are carried out. 
 For example, DevOps automates certain functions of the software delivery cycle. Following its principles, an engineering team can write code to indicate how a web application should be deployed and automated, and then build a “self-service interface” for it, says Kersten. As such, anyone who needs to use this code or infrastructure can simply request for it themselves through the interface, without needing to file a ticket or waiting for an engineer to help them. 
 On top of this, DevOps also breaks down silos between teams in an organization, allowing disparate units like the development and IT teams to work together and deliver software quickly. DevOps does this by taking functions that aren’t normally expressed in code – like a rule change for a network firewall – and allowing them to be so, providing a “common language” that all teams can use to make changes and updates seamlessly. 
 Benefits of integrating security 
 There’s a common perception that the speed of software delivery goes in direct contrast to the quality of the software itself. This is why information security is often an afterthought in the software development process. 
 But this shouldn’t be the case. 
 “It turns out that, if you adopt security practices early in the process, not only do you deliver software quicker, but it tends to be more reliable as well,” points out Kersten. 
 Security is a major consideration in any software, and not prioritizing it means release teams may  neglect security recommendations just to meet deadlines . 
 Keeping security at the forefront helps companies save time and money, as any flaws discovered during the testing phase can be picked up and solved immediately. Catching bugs from the beginning before they grow into something much more troublesome down the line – or worse, discovered only when customers are using the software – reduces risks and costs. 
 Challenges of incorporating security 
 However, the collaborative nature of DevOps may cause issues for some, and this is no different when getting the security and delivery teams to work together. 
 “A lot of people in IT are used to working in a particular manner, and you’re asking them to change the way they work,” says Kersten. 
 Having spent years or even decades creating an operational playbook, changing these processes to add in security measures and forcing the team to work with others could be challenging. Instead of encouraging change, some managers may become protective of their turf instead. 
 It’s also a pain point for the security team to collaborate with new units and people. Puppet recognized this problem after putting together its  2019 State of DevOps Report , which aims to highlight the importance of integrating security into the software delivery process. 
 In the report, security teams described high levels of friction when being forced to work with their non-security counterparts. Among those surveyed, 65% reported feeling the most friction when teams were “minimally” integrated – this goes up to 70% when teams were “selectively” integrated. 
 
   Chart taken from Puppet’s  2019 State of DevOps Report  / Photo credit: Puppet  
 
 Interestingly, respondents from all roles reported the lowest feelings of friction when teams were completely assimilated. This suggests that businesses should commit to the change and ride out any initial waves of discomfort, as teams tend to run more smoothly once they are fully combined. 
 Another issue when applying security measures is that it will affect software delivery speeds initially, as new practices are introduced into areas where they weren’t needed before. Thankfully, this eventually dissipates as teams get more used to the new cycle of work. 
 Finally, deeper security integration doesn’t always mean that audits will turn up fewer issues. However, it does result in auditors being able to give more specific or focused feedback, which is more helpful and actionable than broad observations. 
 Cognitive barriers to overcome 
 While integrating security into any DevOps practice may seem like a no-brainer, many companies still don’t carry out the proper measures. In a  2019 survey of 1,310 IT decision-makers , 54% of respondents were less likely to say that IT security teams were “always consulted.” 
 Conducted by Japanese cybersecurity company Trend Micro, the survey also found that 40% of respondents felt that IT security slowed down their organization’s progress in DevOps. 
 But that’s not to say IT departments are blind to the importance of being more careful. In the same report, 94% of respondents were aware of the security risks in implementing DevOps initiatives. However, their resistance to change was still strong, despite knowing the dangers. Further education on the subject may be the catalyst for better outcomes.

 The latest funding brings Horangi’s total capital raised to US$23.1 million, according to a statement. In 2017, the startup bagged  US$3.1 million  in its series A round led by Monk’s Hill Ventures. 
 Horangi said it will use the new funds to enhance its cloud security product by integrating AI and machine learning capabilities, double its staff to 160 across Southeast Asia, and grow its presence in Singapore and Indonesia, where it sees the highest demand. 
 “Southeast Asia is one of the fastest-growing economies and digitizing rapidly,” said Horangi CEO and co-founder Paul Hadjy. “This is especially prevalent in Indonesia, where we have been focused on since 2016.” 
 Indonesia is one of the fastest-growing markets in the region, with growth rates above  40%  a year. It was also estimated that more than  232 million  cyber attacks occurred in the archipelago in 2018. 
 Horangi was founded in 2016 by Hadjy along with fellow ex-Palantir cybersecurity expert Lee Sult. Its services include penetration testing and virtual chief information security officers. Warden, its cloud security product, protects organizations using public cloud infrastructure from security threats and compliance violations. 
 The startup said it has served over 200 customers across the region, including Gojek, Ninja Van, ShopBack, Tiket, and PropertyGuru.

 According to UNL co-founder and CEO Xander van der Heijden, ecommerce is taking over global retail, but street names and postal codes today were never designed for the digital economy. Moreover, there’s an estimated 4 billion people without an address. 
 “To respond to the limitations of the current systems on businesses and individuals alike, we came to the conclusion we needed to build a universal addressing system that can uniquely identify locations globally,” he told  Tech in Asia . 
 UNL is building what it calls the “internet of places.” 
 Its technology divides the world into a 3D grid of microcells and assigns every cell a location ID (similar to domain names). It then adds a smart contract layer to make locations programmable and transactional, turning a location into a point of sale, point of delivery, or point of payment. 
 In the internet of places, real-life locations are coupled with UNL IDs, powering location-based services in industries such as ecommerce, delivery, mobility, smart-city solutions, and autonomous vehicles. 
 For example, consumers and businesses can customize their address, manage private metadata for purposes such as know-your-customer and the like, perform indoor and outdoor navigation, or optimize last-mile routes, among others, van der Heijden explained. 
 The company said it will use the fresh capital to develop its core infrastructure and further expand its operations globally, starting with Asia. It is now building local teams in Singapore, Indonesia, India, and Japan. 
 UNL was built in Amsterdam in 2018, but the company moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2019, as it recognized the lack of sufficient addressing and digital infrastructure in the region, van der Heijden said. 
 “UNL’s ability to bring accurate location to developing and emerging markets will enable services from delivery to microloans for the next 4 billion internet users,” said William Bao Bean, general partner at SOSV and managing director at MOX.

642745,You have competitors. Don’t try to hide them from investors," What’s one of the fastest ways a founder can turn an investor into the world’s biggest skeptic? 
 Tell them you have no competitors. 
   
 (I can already hear some founders talking back to their screens, “No, but seriously. This is a ‘world first’! No one else is doing what we’re doing!”) 
 But we review more than 2,500 businesses and pitch decks every year. And while there is certainly no shortage of incredible founders who are disrupting entrenched industries and innovating new solutions, the reality is that many of those industries are being disrupted from multiple angles and those solutions are in different stages of development elsewhere. 
 That’s OK! 
 When an investor asks founders who their competitors are, they are trying to understand a few different things. 
 First, they likely want to understand how crowded the market is and whether there are companies that have more funds or are in a position to gain a significant share of the market. 
 This is often why founders try to minimize the focus on competitors. But it’s here where they might need to adapt their perspective. Investors want to understand how you are positioning yourself in the market and your awareness of where you sit in relation to your competition. They want to see evidence that you will be able to differentiate your business and stand out from the crowd. But they also want to see that you’ve done your research, you can back up the credentials in your CV, and that you have a deep understanding of your industry. 
 In fact, there are some instances in which facing a tough rival is a sign of future opportunity. Asking about your competition may give investors additional insight into potential mergers and acquisitions or trade sale opportunities. Knowing about more mature players in the space may also provide investors with a “sanity check” on key metrics in your business assumptions and financial models as well as help provide context around fundraising targets or exit valuations that may be achievable. 
 You have more competitors than you think 
 The reason why my eyes narrow when I hear founders say, “We have no competitors” is because it’s often a warning sign that they haven’t done the appropriate level of research. 
 Similarly, many founders list only local players and reveal that they have not thought about additional rivals that may come into play if they scale the business internationally or into adjacent product areas. 
 Even worse, having no competitors could be a sign that there may not be a need for your product or that you will have the difficult task of creating the market from scratch, rather than building on an existing market. That’s definitely NOT the impression you want to give investors. 
 If you fail to demonstrate a good understanding of your industry and how you will protect and differentiate your business from other firms, then a simple question becomes a major red flag. 
 What to say instead 
 If you really have few or no rivals, you can strengthen your pitch by pointing to a business that is doing something similar, even if it’s in a different industry. 
 This might be a company with a similar business model or one that’s targeting a comparable customer segment. You can even mention if you are a “fast follower” of a large, overseas competitor. In those instances, you can also talk about their traction, the amounts they have raised, or their latest valuations to help spark comparisons with your company. But you would also need to be prepared to discuss whether they are likely to expand into your geography or industry and take the early momentum out from under you. 
 Founders will be more successful in raising capital if they view the competitor question (and all investor questions, for that matter) as an opportunity, not an inquisition. You’ve got their attention, so grab the opportunity to answer with confidence and demonstrate your grasp of the industry, technology, or domain in which you are operating.

643020,Asia a ‘high priority’ for Revolut following mammoth $500m fundraise,"  Revolut , one of the world’s highest-valued financial technology startups with a valuation of US$5.5 billion, has its eyes on Asia. 
 Following the US$500 million it raised from a series D funding round in February, the London-based startup recently opened remittance routes to India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Revolut says it has over 10 million users worldwide and more than 60,000 users in Singapore.

 “The goal is to build a global financial network and Asian countries are critical nodes of that network,” Eddie Lee, Revolut’s Asia-Pacific regional director of operations, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 The company’s suite of financial solutions include cross-border remittances at mid-market exchange rates, peer-to-peer money transfers, and insurance as well as savings and budgeting tools. It also allows commission-free stock trading in the UK. 
 While the startup hopes to expand its services on a larger scale worldwide, navigating the varying dynamics and regulations across regions – even within Asia itself – pose a challenge. Revolut’s current product features in Europe, however, can shed light on what Asian users can expect in future. 
 The company didn’t specify how much it has earmarked for its expansion plans in Asia but said the region is a “very high” priority. At present, it has offices in Singapore, Tokyo, and Melbourne. 
 Rebranding from a travel card 
 In Singapore, over 30% of Revolut’s user transactions come from shopping and groceries, followed by spending on restaurant and dining at 24%. 
 The startup revenue-shares an  interchange fee  with Visa, which is charged to merchants on every transaction made via the Revolut card or app. It also offers annual subscription plans of S$99 (US$70) for Premium accounts and S$199 (US$140) for Metal accounts, which provide customers with perks such as discounts on airport lounge access, complimentary travel insurance, and unlimited quotas on foreign exchange transactions. 
 Revenue from its premium subscription plans climbed 154% last year, according to  numbers the company released  during its latest fundraise.

 As governments impose sweeping lockdowns and travel restrictions to contain the spread of Covid-19, travel activity worldwide has  slumped . 
 The pandemic has hastened Revolut’s rebrand away from being solely a travel card. “One of the challenges we see is that consumers still view us as a travel product, and we need to change that,” Lee points out. 
 But Revolut’s business, which is still hugely dependent on users’ cross-border transactions and spending activities, hasn’t seen a significant impact from the Covid-19 pandemic. “Thankfully, we’re not going down, but we’re not growing at the pace that we see ourselves growing,” Lee adds. 
 A finance super app 
 Lee, who previously led Uber and then UberEats’ operations in Asia Pacific, says that gaining the trust of users is more difficult for fintech firms than it is for ride-hailing or food delivery companies. 
 “People are very value-conscious,” Lee observes. And while for most businesses, that plays out in a straightforward price comparison, “it doesn’t work that way in finance,” he adds. 
 Given that, building an enduring business built on trust is a priority for Revolut, and its newly launched currency routes are part of that approach. 
 “We know there’s a big Indian community in Singapore and a big Filipino community in Singapore and in Japan. So we want to be able to serve the customers here who want access to these things [but] are currently being charged a large fee,” Lee explains. 
 Since 2015, Revolut has been operating without a full banking license in the UK, where its partnerships with local banks allows it to issue bank accounts to users. 
 The company may be pursuing a similar strategy in Singapore, where it’s opted not to apply for a digital banking license in Singapore last year, citing the  high capital requirements  – S$1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) – for a full one. 
 “We ultimately cannot provide everything because finance is too broad and the needs are too niche. We really need partners to be successful in every country that we operate in Asia,” Lee notes. 
 A global financial network 
 Revolut is going up against tough competition in the space.  TransferWise ’s recent  partnership with Alipay  is a huge step for the London-based fintech company into the Chinese market, where inbound remittances were projected to hit US$70.3 billion last year, according to  World Bank data . 
 
  Photo credit: TransferWise 
 
 In Southeast Asia, TransferWise has inked partnerships with multiple local e-wallet operators including Ant Financial-backed GCash and Dana, Gojek’s Go-Pay, and Grab partner Ovo. 
 This comes as Revolut continues to beta-test its product across a few markets in Asia Pacific, including Japan and in Australia. So far, it only operates in Singapore, but  reports  suggest that it could be rolling out in Japan in the coming months. 
 Lee shares that Hong Kong and India, where the startup is looking to hire new talent, might be Revolut’s next Asian markets, but he declined to reveal when those launches will be. 
 “We are building an infrastructure, not just in Southeast Asia, not just in Singapore, but across the world,” Lee says. “And we hope the infrastructure we build creates sustained differentiation that our customers can access – [one] that not many other players can offer.” ",Melissa Goh,0,4,"[(0, 0.3981738), (1, 0.10221982), (2, 0.14851095), (3, 0.3510954)]","['app', 'GCash', 'Revolut', 'TransferWise', 'Alipay', 'Visa', 'Premium']","['Singapore', 'London', 'Asia', 'Tokyo', 'UK', 'Melbourne', 'Europe', 'India', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'Indonesia', 'Tech']"
643013,Gojek’s $1.2b fundraise shows investor confidence despite tepid economic environment," Dear readers, 
 Despite the growing  economic uncertainty , we must remain hopeful. The Covid-19 pandemic will eventually subside just like the 2003 SARS outbreak, which came under control after about a year. Similarly, the economy will also pull through and pick up again after this current crisis. 
 But before we see the green shoots of recovery, we should first weed out our pessimism and find seeds of good news whenever and wherever we can. In the past week, Gojek offered the most encouraging narrative from among the region’s startups. 
 The Indonesian unicorn has raised  $1.2 billion in fresh funding , a sign that venture capital firms and private equity investors are selectively backing companies that present promising long-term opportunities. 
 
  Gojek co-CEOs Andre Soelistyo (left) and Kevin Aluwi / Photo credit: Gojek 
 
 Gojek CEO Andre Soelistyo told employees during an internal  town hall meeting  last week that the company’s transportation business has been profitable for “a few months.” While Soelistyo expressed concern about the impact of the Covid-19, he denied a  DealStreetAsia  story claiming that Gojek has retrenched staff. 
 Although the super app’s food delivery and payments platforms remain in the red, the funding news should be well-received by Gojek’s investors and employees, who have been buffeted by rumors of massive layoffs at the company in recent weeks. 
 In our latest visual story, we train the spotlight on the heavyweight  investors in both Gojek and Grab . While these deep-pocketed financial backers can afford to wait for the archrivals to become profitable and launch an initial public offering, smaller shareholders are seeking to sell shares even at  steep discounts  in the secondary market, reports our chief correspondent Terence Lee.

 Such secondary market shares sales do not typically reflect investors views of the companies. Rather, some shareholders would like to book profits, especially if they invested early in these unicorns. In fact,  private exchanges  provide an alternative exit strategy for investors who cannot wait for the startups to do an IPO, according to our fintech reporter Melissa Goh. 
 Aside from looking for these “green shoots,” we should help cultivate them by acting positively ourselves. And this is what  Tech in Asia  has been doing. While some startups are holding off on hiring, we are selectively bringing in fresh talent – at least in the newsroom. Earlier this month, we recruited  Joseph Gan  to expand our coverage of social media companies as well as agriculture and food technology startups. He’s a former broadcast journalist from  CNBC  and  Channel NewsAsia  who helped build  AgFunder ’s coverage in Asia and Latin America in the past year.

642958,"Indian crypto trading platform banks $3m from Bain, Polychain, others"," Crypto exchanges in India are expecting a surge in trading after the country’s Supreme Court lifted the central bank’s ban, which prohibited financial institutions from facilitating any service relating to virtual currencies. 
 To capitalize on the opportunity, local crypto exchange aggregator  CoinDCX  has raised US$3 million in a series A round led by Polychain Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, and BitMEX operator HDR Group, alongside other VCs. 
 It plans to promote crypto adoption in India and ramp up product development, service, marketing activities, research and development, and human resources.

 Founded in 2017, CoinDCX uses a liquidity aggregation model integrated with global exchanges like Binance, Huobi Global, and OKEx, eliminating the hassle for traders that deal with multiple platforms. Its suite of products includes a fiat-to-crypto service, spot trading, margin trading, and futures trading. 
 With the ban lifted, CoinDCX also becomes the first crypto exchange in India to integrate bank account transfers, according to a statement. 
 The startup will use the fresh capital for market expansion and the addition of new trading pairs to its platform. It will also co-develop a fiat onboarding solution with major crypto projects, implement algorithm-based trading, and launch a crypto-to-crypto trading product this year. 
 Just last week, the company launched a campaign called TryCrypto, pledging US$1.3 million to bring the total number of crypto users in India to 50 million. 
 “The recent developments in the cryptocurrency regulatory landscape in India are very encouraging and are likely to accelerate adoption and innovation in this sector,” said HDR Group CEO and co-founder Arthur Hayes. 
 HDR and Polychain are no strangers to the crypto industry. Their other portfolio companies include stablecoin MakerDAO, blockchain-based cloud computing firm DFinity, and Rain, the Middle East’s first licensed crypto exchange. 
 Meanwhile, Bain Capital has made more than 940 investments in numerous industries, including LinkedIn, Jet.com, and DocusSign. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(3, 0.99959975)]","['DocusSign', 'Binance', 'TryCrypto']",['India']
642993,Disney+ postpones India launch as Covid-19 delays major cricket event," 
 As millions of Indians stay home amid the ongoing lockdown in major cities due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country, streaming players like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney-owned  Hotstar  have been seeing a surge in demand for the past two weeks. Now, Netflix and Amazon Prime have both received good news.

 Their archrival Disney’s impending launch of its latest over-the-top (OTT) service, Disney+, which it unveiled in the US last November, has been postponed in India. 
 The launch was earlier scheduled for March 29 this year to coincide with the beginning of India’s biggest cricketing tournament, the Indian Premier League (IPL). However, with the rapid spread of Covid-19 cases in the country, the sporting event has been delayed until April 15, 2020. And so has the Disney+ launch. 
 “We recently announced that Disney+ would launch in India through the Hotstar service in conjunction with the beginning of the Indian Premier League cricket season,” Uday Shankar, president of The Walt Disney Company APAC and chairman of Star &amp; Disney India, said in a statement on Friday. “Given the delay of the season, we have made the decision to briefly pause the roll-out of Disney+ and will announce a new revised premiere date for the service soon.” 
 Netflix and Amazon may have lost some traffic to Hotstar, where Disney+ will be made available, at a time when the demand for OTT services is highest in the country. Now that the launch has been delayed, they don’t have to worry about it until mid-April. 
 Disney had been pretty excited about the launch until recently. In fact, it launched the service for a small group of customers on March 11 to test the service out, but rolled it back within 24 hours. 
 “A limited release of the beta version of the Disney+ Hotstar app is currently being tested with a small number of consumers in preparation for the full-fledged app launch on the 29th March,” a Hotstar spokesperson told local media  Hindustan Times . 
 However, the coronavirus outbreak has forced the world’s second most populous country to go under lockdown till March 31, shutting down effectively all but the essential services like groceries in major cities. Consequently, all the events including IPL have been cancelled to prevent the virus spread. 
 The IPL cricket tournament – which usually consists of 60 games and lasts for seven to eight weeks – has been a crucial element of Hotstar’s India strategy. 
 When Hotstar launched its subscription service back in April 2016, it used IPL, along with season six of hit American series  Game of Thrones , as a bait to lure users to come to the platform and was able to lock them in for a year with its annual subscription. Over the years, IPL has made Hotstar the number one player in the South Asian nation. 
 Last year, Hotstar said the cricket series had over 300 million in viewership overall, as compared to 202 million overall viewership in 2018. According to data-driven research platform Oddup, as of October 2019, Hotstar enjoyed a 29% market share, followed by Amazon Prime’s 10% and Netflix’s 5% share. 
 Disney’s Indian streaming platform is expected to gain an edge over its competitors when Disney+ rolls out in the country. During the earnings call in February this year, current executive chairman Bob Iger said Disney+ had amassed  28.6 million subscribers within three months of its launch in the US and a few other countries like Canada, the Netherlands, and Australia. 
 With more than half a billion smartphone users, India is an important market for the US streaming giants. As the Indian urban population stays at home in tier-1 cities, which accounts for a lion’s share of subscribers for OTT players, the current period is most critical for them to gain market share. 
 While streaming services are seeing a surge in traffic, there is a flip side too. 
 With businesses implementing work-from-home policies, schools conducting online classes, and digital payments going up, among other things, telecom service providers are facing increasing pressure on their network infrastructure. Local media recently reported that Indian telecom operators have reached out to at least 12 OTT video-streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon, Hotstar, and YouTube to undertake measures like switching the streaming quality from high definition to standard definition to ease of the throttle. 
 The Cellular Operators Association of India, the industry body that represents Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Reliance Jio, and telecom gear makers in India, has also requested the government to communicate the issue to the streaming platforms. 
 Just last week, these global giants were asked to lower streaming quality in Europe. Netflix said it would reduce traffic on European networks by around 25%, while Google-owned YouTube said it would switch all traffic in the EU to standard definition by default for 30 days.

642991,"Uber, Ola suspend ride-sharing services in India as Covid-19 cases spike"," Uber India and Ola Cabs have suspended their ride-sharing services in India as Covid-19 cases spike in one of the world’s most densely populated countries. 
 “We have suspended Uber Pool in India until further notice,” a spokeswoman for Uber told  Tech in Asia , referring to the ride-sharing service. “We are determined to help reduce the spread of coronavirus in the cities we serve,” she added. The decision was made and implemented on Friday.

  Tech in Asia  had previously  reported  that the Covid-19 outbreak might lead Uber to suspend its ride-sharing services outside of the US and Canada. 
 Homegrown competitor Ola Cabs also said it is temporarily suspending its ride-sharing service until further notice as it steps up efforts to help curb the spread of Covid-19. “The temporary suspension of Ola Share services is an attempt to encourage social distancing for all cases of essential travel for citizens,” the company said in a press release. 
 India today has  415  confirmed cases of Covid-19, up from 360 yesterday, as well as seven deaths, the country’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare reported. On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepped up measures to contain the pandemic by asking citizens to observe a day-long curfew. The government had earlier enforced social distancing and suspended or severely restricted mass transport as well as non-essential services. 
 Uber and Ola’s decision to suspend their ride-sharing services in India follows a similar move by Grab, which earlier halted its GrabShare services in Singapore and the Philippines. But unlike Grab, Uber and Ola have been unable to diversify their revenue streams beyond ride-hailing. 
 Ride-sharing is the preferred mode of cab-hailing in India and in other emerging markets due to the lower cost. Around 1.7 million rides per day are taken through Uber and Ola’s platforms in India’s top seven cities and 2.25 million nationwide, local consultancy firm RedSeer’s estimates. Uber, meanwhile, completes 14 million trips across the world each day, the company said. 
 Both Uber and Ola said they will support their drivers amid the suspension. 
 Uber said any driver or delivery person diagnosed with Covid-19 or asked to self‑isolate by public health authorities would receive financial assistance for up to 14 days while their Uber account is on hold. “We’ve already helped drivers in some affected areas, and we’re working to quickly implement this worldwide,” it said.

 “Our Partner Care teams and Safety Response teams are available 24/7 for any concerns that may arise for driver-partners and customers, respectively,” said Ola, without indicating whether it will be providing financial assistance. 
 The suspension of some popular ride-sharing services comes as technology startups pivot to pursue profits instead of reckless growth. 
 Of the lot, Uber’s strong cash position has kept bears at bay so far. “We are very fortunate to have a strong cash position with about US$10 billion of unrestricted cash as of the end of February,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on a call with analysts on February 19.

642888,India’s CureFit bags $110m in Temasek-led round," Health and wellness startup  CureFit  might be inching closer to unicorn status after securing about US$110 million in a funding round led by Temasek. 
 The round included participation from new backer GableHorn Investments as well as existing investors Accel Partners, Chiratae Ventures, and the VC arm of consumer goods giant Unilever, local media reported.

 Temasek confirmed the investment but did not disclose any other financial figures. 
 “We can confirm the investment in CureFit, as per the filings made with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, government of India,” Temasek told  Tech in Asia  in an emailed statement. “Beyond that, we have nothing further to add on the investment at this point in time.” 
 CureFit has yet to respond to  Tech in Asia’s  request for comment. 
 It was reported in December last year that Temasek was in discussions with CureFit about a potential US$100 million investment. At the time, the startup was said to be  seeking  a post-money valuation of US$800 million. 
 It was also earlier reported that CureFit was in talks with Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for a possible investment round that might value the startup at over US$1 billion. No deal, however, has materialized yet. 
 In April 2019, the Bengaluru-based startup closed its series D round at US$120 million, pushing its total capital raised at the time to US$290 million. It was valued at over US$575 million. 
 According to  Livemint , Temasek’s interest in backing CureFit falls in line with its plans to increase its focus on late-stage deals in India. 
 Prior to its capital injection into CureFit, the Singapore investment company also led a US$30 million top-up for ShopBack’s  US$45 million funding round  last year. In January 2020, it led the  US$40 million  series B financing of New Zealand AI research firm Soul Machines and joined US-based ClassPass’  US$285 million  raise.

642761,Bridging the digital gap between consumers and merchants (Infographic)," In countries across the globe, the adoption of digital services has been uneven between merchants and consumers. 
 In Singapore, for instance,  almost one-third of consumers  use their mobile phones to pay for goods and services, while only  26% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  in the city-state have adopted digital payment options. 
 The difference might not seem like much, but for the 30% of Singaporeans who use mobile payments, it’s a noticeable gap – especially considering that  SMEs make up 99% of the businesses in the country . 
 But according to the  2020 Retail Trends in Singapore  report by digital merchant platform  Fave , retailers are increasingly adopting digital services to reach their customers. Tech in Asia  takes a look at how merchants can catch up to their consumers’ digital adoption level. 
   
 
 Fave connects merchants and consumers to deliver seamless payment experiences and serves as a payment aggregator for the most popular cards and e-wallets. Integrated with other strategic partners, Fave also offers merchants more value-add and customer exposure through marketing, data, financing, and operations features.

642807,"Minor Gojek, Grab investors head for the exit amid worsening economy"," As Southeast Asia’s tech unicorns Grab and Gojek reach ever-higher valuations, investors have been looking to cash out. 
 Since last year, minor as well as early investors in these two firms have been trying to off-load their stakes, sometimes at deep discounts, multiple people keeping track of the  private secondary market  tell  Tech in Asia . 
 
  Illustration: Centaine Lim 
 
 Some exceptions aside, Gojek’s shares tend to be priced at a larger discount on the valuation compared to Grab, according to our analysis of data from six sources who are privy to the secondary market. 
 While discounts on individual trades can be affected by perceptions of an organization’s performance, that is by no means the only factor, observes a broker who deals in both companies’ shares. He adds that Grab is known to keep a tight rein on its secondary share prices. 
   
 The trading activity is set to accelerate. Investors are feeling jittery as the global market sees its worst free fall since the 2008 global financial crisis. More sellers in the secondary market are now competing for a limited pool of buyers and driving down share prices, a source notes. 
 Now might be a good time for investors to sell at least a portion of their shares – Grab and Gojek are currently worth billions, which means early backers stand to make a lucrative return even at a big discount. 
 Not wavering 
 Gojek’s most powerful shareholders, however, are standing their ground. “Nobody who’s of any importance and holds any decent number of shares has sold or is looking to sell,” says a prominent investor in the firm who wishes to remain unnamed. 
 Some of them have also reinvested in the company through its recently announced  US$1.2 billion round , insiders close to the company say. One firm, which was an early backer of the super app, tells  Tech in Asia  that it hasn’t sold its shares and isn’t planning to. 
 Gojek’s and Grab’s biggest investors, of course, have a pragmatic reason to hold the equity: Because they came in at higher valuations, a discounted sale would be unattractive or even loss-making.

 People familiar with Gojek are denying that there’s been any secondary sale. But unlike a public stock exchange, it’s impossible to have a full view on trades or prices on the private secondary market, where shares of pre-IPO companies are traded. 
 For example, a source says that a broker had received a request to sell a sizable US$100 million stake in Gojek – or about 1% of the company – at a steep 40% to 45% discount on its most recent valuation of US$9.5 billion. 
 Three people close to Gojek tell  Tech in Asia  that they’ve not heard about this event, but it’s possible that the broker may not have floated the request to them yet. 
 On Grab’s side of things, a seller had tried to offload his shares at 50% discount but did not succeed. We were unable to ascertain more details about this offer. 
  See:  Grab and Gojek’s investors visualized on an interactive network graph   
 Secondary share trades of private companies often command millions of US dollars and are restricted to companies’ employees, high net worth individuals, and investment funds. 
 They’re also usually done through brokers or  nascent exchanges  such as Singapore’s Fundnel. 
 Because of these challenges, discounts are often used to entice buyers, “otherwise, they’ll just come in at the new fundraise,” notes a private equity executive who’s opted to remain anonymous. 
 Cat and mouse game 
 The reality is that making a direct sale (selling shares on Grab’s or Gojek’s cap tables) at a steep discount is difficult. 
 These companies, which are far from distressed, can often block any new investor from joining their cap table through a right of first refusal. They’re likely to push back on any trade that carries a heavy markdown, as it sends the wrong signal to the market. 
 
  Photo credit: Grab 
 
 But there’s a way around it: an indirect sale. A few limited partners – investors in the funds or special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that have backed Gojek – have already sold their shares at a 45% discount, a source reveals. Meanwhile, Grab shares from an SPV are selling at a 14% discount, another person notes. 
 These types of transfers won’t leave a trace on a company’s cap table. Instead, these investors are trading shares in the funds that own a slice of the firms. Such trades are harder to track and block, although most buyers would still inform the company involved to avoid jeopardizing the relationship, a broker says. 
 “There’s a chance they may get found out if they don’t disclose,” he adds. 
  Tech in Asia  could not determine the identity of some of the sellers nor the number of shares they’ve sold or are looking to sell. Gojek’s investors, speaking on condition of anonymity, admit that they have no visibility into those SPV trades. 
 A thick fog 
 The opacity of the private secondary market means exact benchmarks are hard to come by. But several rules of thumb apply: A final discount beyond 30% would be atypical, according to sources familiar with private secondary share sales. 
 Benjamin Twoon, the chief operating officer of Fundnel, says that discounts of 50% to 60% would apply to distressed assets like bankrupt firms, for example. 
 Meanwhile, discounts of up to 40% can become common in an economic downturn, a broker says. 
 But a company’s share price should be interpreted with care, as a deep discount may also have nothing to do with the state of an organization. 
 The discount may start out high but drop later on if an offer sees stronger-than-expected demand. 
   
 Gojek is looking to change the narrative and boost employee morale after months of uncertainty, which may have reflected in its secondary share prices. It faced a difficult  regional expansion , the  resignation of its founder-CEO , and rumors of a  potential merger , which it denied. 
 The super app recently announced a  US$1.2 billion  cash infusion in its still-open series F round, which may kick-start new attempts by investors to sell shares from the decacorn. 
 A Gojek spokesperson has declined to comment on “rumors and speculation.” Grab declined to comment as well. 
 While now might be a good time for some investors to unload their shares, recent news like WeWork’s botched IPO and the Covid-19 outbreak could make that tougher. 
 Fundnel’s Twoon says that he saw an even mix of buyers and sellers in the market last year. That’s changed, as more sellers have entered, bringing the ratio to around 8:2 today, he says. 
 The increase in sellers and discounts may have something to do with how companies are being forced to postpone their public listings.

 According to a source, a Gojek investor has been trying to unload US$30 million worth of shares since the end of last year with no luck.

 The plummeting share prices are good news for buyers, though. While investors are more reluctant to fund early-stage startups, buyers are prowling for good deals with mature firms, a broker says. 
 Grab and Gojek shares are hot commodities at the right price, though one source says Grab shares are seeing more buyers and sellers. Nonetheless, investors tell  Tech in Asia  that they would immediately snap up Gojek shares at a 40% to 45% discount. 
 One buyer believes that the archrivals are solving real problems in the region and are worthy companies to back – a person acquiring Grab’s or Gojek’s shares at half price could still yield a good return even if they sell at 30% off. 
 “If you put US$100 million in the bank, there’s no way you can get a 20% return,” the buyer reasons. ",Terence Lee,0,6,"[(0, 0.77776486), (2, 0.22216615)]","['Gojek', 'Fundnel', 'WeWork', 'app']","['Asia', 'Fundnel', 'Singapore']"
642899,WeWork demands completion of SoftBank’s $3b commitment," WeWork on Sunday said SoftBank should complete its US$3 billion tender offer, which the Japanese conglomerate promised to the office-sharing startup as part of a US$9.5 billion rescue package. 
 “The Special Committee of the WeWork Board of Directors remains committed to taking all necessary actions to ensure that the tender offer, which SoftBank has promised to our employees and shareholders, is completed,” the company said in an emailed statement.

 WeWork’s response comes after reports last week said that SoftBank  may walk away from  the US$3 billion tender offer it committed to finance the embattled startup following its shelved IPO plans. 
 “Not only is SoftBank obligated to consummate the tender offer […] but its excuses for not trying to close are inappropriate and dishonest,” the company said. 
 It was reported that SoftBank might not repurchase shares from existing investors due to regulatory investigations into WeWork by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. SoftBank also said there was a delay in recapitalizing WeWork’s joint venture in China. 
 According to WeWork, SoftBank backing out from the agreement would be “completely unethical,” especially given the current environment with the Covid-19 crisis. 
 SoftBank emphasized that it “continues to honor its obligations” under the agreement, adding that “the tender offer has no impact on SoftBank’s commitment to WeWork or on the financial strength of the business.” 
 “SoftBank has informed stockholders that all of the agreed upon closing conditions must be satisfied before the tender offer can be completed,” the company said. “As of now, they are not.” 
 In October last year, the Japanese company promised WeWork a bailout program that includes US$5 billion in debt financing, a US$3 billion tender offer, and US$1.5 billion in investment. SoftBank is expected to own 80% of WeWork after the deal closes. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.99944437)]","['WeWork', 'SoftBank']",['China']
642770,A new Wi-Fi upgrade could improve connectivity in emerging markets," For many enterprises, a slow internet connection can hamper business. The average workplace now consists of various Wi-Fi-connected devices like laptops and smartphones, all of which are usually linked to a handful of routers within the same building. 
 This load can cause internet connection speeds to slow down significantly, leading to connectivity issues, decreased productivity, and a limited ability to access information. 
 It’s also just really frustrating for both the employees at these companies and the end consumers who use their products – after all, why bother trying to buy something online when it takes forever to load the listings? 
 In emerging markets with underdeveloped Wi-Fi infrastructures like Indonesia, where internet speeds are at  200 Mbps on average , the situation is even worse. 
 The answer to the problems created by an increased load on routers could be Wi-Fi 6. 
 A Wi-Fi upgrade 
 Wi-Fi 6 is the latest iteration of the set of local area network protocols that enable access to the internet. The technology supports 4x higher network bandwidth and user concurrency compared to its predecessor, Wi-Fi 5, explains Tony Shi, the chief technology officer of Southern Pacific enterprise networking solutions at  Huawei .

 The key draw of Wi-Fi 6 is that it enables more devices to use the same network without things slowing down. 
 Additionally, if the network realizes that it is only sending a small amount of data in a transmission, it can use the remaining bandwidth to send information to other devices on the network. 
 All of this helps users get more out of every transmission from their router. 
 The benefits of this are most tangible in offices, where multiple devices – all requiring large amounts of data to be transmitted – are connected to the same network. 
 However, Wi-Fi 6 can be useful outside of offices as well. 
 “[Warehouses] can improve their operation efficiency and lower the safety risk of their staff in the warehouse of their distribution center in the logistics industry through the use of automatic guided vehicles,” says Shi. 
 Wi-Fi 6 could also enable logistics companies to use  the internet of things to track packages  within a warehouse or storage area. 
 Impact on emerging markets 
 Developing countries are often home to manufacturing plants and producers of raw materials, and having accurate delivery information would boost efficiency. 
 However, most existing Wi-Fi infrastructures in these markets are unable to cope with the sheer amount of devices required for IoT to be implemented effectively. Wi-Fi 6 would make an immense difference.

 Additionally, due to its ability to handle connectivity with a much higher number of devices, the tech can be deployed by governments to provide better internet services in public areas. This will be especially helpful for the developing world, where only  44.7% of people  have access to and are using the internet. 
 By providing free or cheap Wi-Fi in public areas such as community centers and libraries, people who would have otherwise been unable to afford home Wi-Fi or personal mobile data plans would be able to use online services for things like job applications or online shopping. 
 A wireless future 
 Having better internet connectivity can  drive productivity  and boost company efficiency. 
 As developing markets continue working toward improved online access, Wi-Fi 6 will go a long way in ensuring that businesses and governments are able to take full advantage of the internet. It will also minimize the need for complex, wired infrastructures to deliver better internet services. 
 “The biggest contribution of Wi-Fi is to liberate people from traditional, wired networks and to provide convenient network services for individual users and social organizations,” says Shi. 
 
 Huawei is a leading global provider of information and communications technology infrastructure and smart devices. Its  Huawei AirEngine Wi-Fi 6  product helps enterprises build Wi-Fi 6 networks, enabling them to move toward a fully connected, intelligent world.

642840,Former Gojek COO attempts to crack Indonesia’s education problem," Rohan Monga, the new CEO of  Zenius , is aggressively pursuing growth after the Jakarta-based education technology startup  secured US$20 million in fresh capital  from investors including Northstar Group earlier this year. 
 For starters, Zenius is making its educational videos available to Indonesian students for free, as the 15-year old company tries to slug it out with the dominant player, Ruangguru. 
 The rivals are competing in a market of 45 million students, 3 million teachers, and 220,000 public and private schools. Zenius claims it has 11.8 million registered users compared with Ruangguru’s 15 million and London-based Quipper’s 6 million. The companies, however, didn’t reveal their monthly active users.

 The most recent results from the Programme for International Student Assessment, which measures reading, math, and science skills – shows that  Indonesian students are among the lowest scorers  globally. 
 “When we saw the report, we realized that there’s a lot of work to be done,” says Monga, who was previously chief operating officer at Gojek. “However, with the focus of the current administration on human capital development, we want to support that and make sure Indonesian education undergoes a major change.” 
  A report from impact investor Omidyar Network  found that internet infrastructure and smartphone penetration in Indonesia have given edtech startups access to more users than ever before, including remote populations. The country’s consumer spending on mobile learning applications is forecast to reach US$7.7 billion in 2019, the third highest in the world behind China and India. 
 In December 2019, Zenius started to offer 80,000 videos on its platform for free  to attract more students , explains company founder and ex-CEO Sabda PS. 
 Addicted to learning 
 More users also mean that Zenius will get more user engagement data that can be analyzed – the most important metric for Monga. For example, if a student skips the video, it means that the material is boring. If a student rewinds the video, it means the content is hard to understand. 
 Monga wants to optimize these elements. “We have to be self-critical; we have to keep improving,” says Monga.

 Ruangguru, which has more than 4,000 employees in its payroll, invested a lot in marketing campaigns and offline salespeople. It was fueled by  a US$150 million series C round  that it raised from General Atlantic and GGV Capital late last year. 
 With less funding, Zenius prefers a more measured approach to offline sales while continuing to do online marketing. “With a free platform, do we need [a lot of] salespeople?” Monga says. 
 Omidyar Network’s research said that Zenius primarily uses inbound marketing like social media, blogs, and newsletters, to attract users. The company has only 200 employees to date and prefers to aggressively hire people for its technology and content team. 
 Monga declined to comment on when Zenius will start to charge users again, saying that he is still “devising a strategy that can help the company build a sustainable business.” 
 Digital piracy 
 With US$10,000, Sabda and several teachers set up Zenius in 2004 as an offline tutoring business. 
 Even then, Sabda already had the idea to record his tutoring sessions so he could teach more students outside Jakarta. However, internet usage was very limited at the time, so putting videos online wasn’t an option. Instead, he decided in 2007 to put the videos in a CD or DVD. Sales hit 1.3 billion rupiah (around US$82,000) in the first year, exceeding the company’s expectations. 
 Sabda had to tackle several challenges in the journey, and the biggest one was digital piracy. People copied Zenius’ videos and then sold them at a cheaper price. Monga, however, has a different take on the illegal practice – he sees it as a success metric. 
 “It is proof that those videos developed a cult following. Students fell in love with the product, so there must be something really powerful there,” the CEO explains. 
 Around 2011, when internet usage became mainstream, Zenius began putting its content on its website. The company has long been profitable,  according to Sabda , but it couldn’t reach a level of scale that can push its growth. In 2019, Sabda tried to raise funds to expand the business and ended up with a meeting with Monga. 
 Gojek influence 
 After 3.5 years of building Gojek, first as COO and then as international head, Monga needed a break. He left right before Gojek launched its operations in Thailand and Vietnam, which had been developed under his supervision. 
 “When you work in a startup that scales really fast, it feels like time has just gone,” he observes. 
 His Gojek experience shaped him, Monga says, increasing his passion for problem-solving, technology, and social impact. He was thinking about building his third startup when his wife introduced him to Sabda. 
 Monga contributed to Zenius’ seed round in May 2019 without any intention to become CEO. But somewhere along the way, he and Sabda realized that the company needed improvement in terms of execution speed and scale. Three months later, he replaced Sabda, who moved on to become chief education officer. 
 “I’m here to help craft the business strategy and execution, while Sabda will continue to make sure that the education side is strong and keeps evolving,” says Monga.

 Joining Zenius may give Monga a sense of déjà vu. At Gojek, he had to go up against a rival with a bigger war chest in Grab. At Zenius, he also has to deal with similar conditions with heavily funded Ruangguru as a competitor. 
 Monga admits that Gojek’s and Zenius’ market is different. Gojek is more like a transactional platform, while at Zenius, the key is users’ engagement. However, the main strategy to run both businesses is still the same. 
 “It is less about money,” he says. “It is about making something that people love as authentically as possible.”

642530,Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem has a lot of heart ❤️,"  So far, 2020 has completely upended plans big and small.   
  It’s easy to feel overwhelmed in these uncertain times. Just this week, my colleagues and I spent less than six hours in Myanmar before we were suddenly called back due to new travel restrictions, laying waste to months of careful preparations.   
  However, there are also many glimmers of hope amid the chaos that renew my confidence in our community. We have seen incredible gestures, such as  Jack Ma’s donation  to help the US and Europe fight their worsening Covid-19 situation or education tech startups such as Ruangguru, Quipper, Zenius, and Byju’s making their platform free to help students who are quarantined at home. Here in Singapore, Razer has begun converting manufacturing lines so they can produce surgical masks intended for donation to other countries.  
  Many such stories abound and strengthen a core belief about our community:   Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem has a lot of heart. ❤️  
   
  It sounds simple, but we should not take it for granted. The tech revolution in Silicon Valley began with idealistic visions of using technology to meaningfully improve lives. But we have seen mission drift over the years as startups focused on products to make things more convenient, solve a niche consumer need, or merely get acquired and cash out.  
  But the original tech vision is very much alive and well in Southeast Asia. In conversation after conversation, our region’s founders and tech leaders have placed the notion of “building companies to serve their communities” at the center of their mission.  
  When it’s business as usual, this means assisting merchants in accessing new markets, helping small businesses get paid more transparently and in a timely manner, or fostering the next generation of tech talent.  
  In these extraordinary circumstances, a mission-driven approach can help guide the way. This year will be a test of resilience as many startups will deal with missed revenue targets, diminishing runways, layoffs, and down-rounds for the first time.   
  Crises are key times for companies to innovate, develop creative solutions, and go after the thing that they were previously  too scared to try   . Difficult situations are also opportunities for businesses to go back to fundamentals they may have let slip.   
  So refocus on your mission, build products that people love and need, practice good business sense (watch that burn!), and act with empathy towards your customers, employees, and community.  
  Mission and heart cannot replace sound business practices, but when paired together, they can lead to innovations that can help you move past these dark times. Southeast Asia already has a head start, thanks to our strong core values. Let’s use this fertile ground to create generation-defining tech platforms, products, and services.  
  I know it’s been a rough start to the new decade, but I see this period as a chance to reset for the next few years. And beyond this pandemic, well, we still have a lot of  work to do .

 Launched in 2015, Univariety operates an online marketplace for career counseling, guidance, and college planning services to students and educational institutions. It also works with schools across India to extend its products offline and supplement its digital offerings. 
 With the new capital, Univariety said it plans to further grow its business, focusing on product development, scaling up its alumni platform for schools, and deeper brand building. 
 Jaideep Gupta, founder and CEO of Univariety, said that the company remains focused on making career guidance and counseling mainstream for schools in India. “Our next phase of growth is focused on bringing in parents fully into the mix,” he added. 
 Univariety is owned and operated by International Educational Gateway, which serves students in Singapore, India, and the UK. To date, the startup said it has served over 100,000 students and has partnered with more than 350 schools across 60 cities in India. 
 Info Edge first invested in Univariety in 2017, acting as the sole investor in the startup’s roughly US$1.9 million raise. 
 It recently backed programming-focused edtech firm  Coding Ninjas , pouring  US$5.2 million  into the India-based startup.

642723,Here are the latest tech developments in the trade finance industry – and what’s next," While “trade finance” is a relatively obscure term to the ordinary person, it plays an instrumental role in the world of international business. 
 Trade finance is a set of financial instruments that helps companies facilitate international trade and ensures that these firms are able to easily import and export goods and services by reducing the inherent risks involved in the process. These include currency fluctuations, political upheaval, delayed payments, non-payments, or a trade partner’s solvency. 
 Key parties in trade finance include banks, which the industry relies on to serve as the middleman between importers and exporters. These intermediaries help facilitate trade transactions through a number of tools such as letters of credit, lending products, export credit and financing, factoring (using invoices as a form of collateral), and so on. 
 The importance of this sector is difficult to overstate, especially when you consider the scale of its influence and its long legacy. For instance, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) estimates that by 2027, the global trade industry would be worth US$25 trillion – 80% of which is reliant on trade financing. 
 A mountain of paper 
 The field may be well-established, but it’s not without its flaws. 
 According to  The Economist , the trade financing industry is notoriously bogged down by a complicated network of institutions. It’s hampered by bottlenecks, as the majority of transactions are funneled through a mere handful of global financial centers. The average credit process also requires a great deal of paper documentation – at least 36 original documents and 240 copies – estimated at a staggering 4 billion pages of documents each year, reveals the ICC. 
 As such, unlike other segments of the financial industry, trade finance has largely remained resistant to change, resulting in a slow, inaccurate, and costly process. 
 These are old problems, but new and established players are trying to fix them with technological solutions. 
 “From artificial intelligence to blockchain, we’ve seen a number of innovations in recent years that aim to make trade finance more efficient,” says Edwin Chan, head of transaction banking product management for BNP Paribas’s Asia-Pacific arm.

 One example is the use of  blockchain-based solutions . The open ledger structure supported by this tech reduces the need for middlemen by collecting necessary information in a single blockchain that’s easily accessible, automatically updated, and highly transparent. 
 There’s already plenty of buzz around the use of blockchain for trade finance, with large corporations like  Deloitte  and even startups like  Komgo  getting into the scene. 
  Contour  is another name in the space. Previously known as Voltron, the project was established by fintech consortium R3 and eight banks, including BNP Paribas. 
 Contour was designed as a trade finance prototype that aims to digitize letters of credit by using blockchain. What was a traditionally paper-based process that required several days’ waiting time was transformed into a quick check that takes less than 24 hours to complete. Contour is currently conducting trials in 14 different countries, in partnership with over 50 banks and corporations. 
 All on the same page 
 Another example of innovative trade finance technologies is Singapore’s  Networked Trade Platform (NTP) , which was launched in 2018 as a multibank trade information management platform. In theory, it streamlines paper-based trade financing processes by consolidating them in a single ecosystem. As an initiative by the city-state’s government – which is well-known as a pioneer in state-led technology ventures – the platform bolsters Singapore’s strong reputation in global trade relations. 
 Through the NTP, companies will be able to access all the necessary trade information, as well as connect with parties up and down the supply chain. Digitized documentation may also be housed in the platform and quickly shared with business partners, financial institutions, and regulators. 
 Similar projects have been done by the likes of Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority, which created  eTradeConnect , a digital trade finance platform that uses distributed ledger technology. It was developed by a consortium of 12 major banks in Hong Kong, including BNP Paribas. 
 This sense of interconnectedness, according to BNP Paribas’ Chan, is a common goal for banks involved in developing innovative trade financing technologies. However, “the journey through a digital process in trade finance is still very fragmented,” he points out. “We need connectivity and interoperability across the various actors in the ecosystem, from banks to regulators, service providers, and platforms.” 
 Differing standards for trade finance technologies, for example, is something that has yet to be reconciled, he adds. 
 “We’re now seeing blockchain companies increasingly talking to each other to create an interoperable framework in order to lower barriers for companies with smaller trade volumes,” he shares.

 A matter of trust 
 For Chan, there is a clear correlation between the power of digital platforms and the efforts of financial institutions to strengthen their customers’ trust in their products. Part of the reason why trade finance remains so reliant on paper processes is that in the financial industry, “documentary trade” is still considered the standard for proof of transaction. Blockchain is so appealing for facilitating trade financing precisely because it provides radical transparency for credit-conservative financial institutions. 
 “Open account financing has always been done on trust,” he explains. Anyone can provide electronic documents, but the important task is to determine if this information originated from the correct source. 
 “What [BNP Paribas is] doing as a bank is pushing for different actors to participate and making sure we are connected with our different partners. We can use technology, as it is an intermediary that both parties trust.” 
 However, the biggest hurdle to this push is the low adoption of trade finance technologies among companies as well as the poorly defined regulations around their use. Blockchain, for instance, has a very high barrier to entry that naturally discourages smaller businesses from even considering them. 
 “For a successful digitization, it is critical that the whole industry and ecosystem work together towards a common goal,” says Chan. “Intellectually, we understand the benefits – we don’t want the 4 billion pieces of paper. Now, it’s about taking the steps to implement and adopt these solutions.” 
 Despite the challenges, Chan is optimistic. Government-led initiatives are an encouraging sign that the public sector is already paying attention, so the rest is just a matter of time. 
 “There needs to be a carrot-and-stick balance,” he explains. “From a regulator’s point of view, they want collaboration with banks, a whole lot of other people, and the ecosystem. From a bank’s standpoint, we need to actively participate in the digitization process to understand the technology better and be the bridge between the technology, our clients, and the trade finance world. 
 As technology becomes more familiar, “adoption will come naturally,” says Chan.

 Launched last year, the startup connects farmers, suppliers, and consumers through its network of agents to bring fresh products to households. Its agents, or  mitras , are mostly housewives who earn extra income through the service. 
 Chilibeli said it empowers housewives to be microentrepreneurs. The agents, who are called Mitra Chilibeli, create their own community in the startup’s app, through which their friends can make purchases. The company delivers the goods to the agents, who then manage the last-mile delivery themselves. 
 According to the company, 20% of the expenditure of Indonesia’s households go into groceries. And housewives, who are typically in control of family spending, are looking for opportunities to earn a living. 
 “The Chilibeli team is tapping into something that other platforms to date haven’t been able to successfully leverage: the trusted social circle,” said Justin Hall, a partner at Golden Gate Ventures. 
 Alex Feng, the CEO of Chilibeli, said that the company will use the funds to strengthen its communities in Jakarta, Tangerang Selatan, and Depok. It will also expand its reach to Bogor and Bekasi. Part of the funds will also go toward Chilibeli’s user interface and experience and warehouse in Depok. 
 To date, the company said it has gained 150% month-on-month growth and created more than 300 direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs for its Mitra Chilibeli in Indonesia.

642746,"Tencent Q4 revenue up 25%, but Covid-19 expected to impact next quarter"," 
 
  Tencent  has reported total revenue of US$15.2 billion for the fourth quarter in 2019 on March 18, a year-on-year increase of 25%. While still missing estimates, this marks the company’s strongest quarter for the financial year. 
 Tencent’s stocks, listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange, rose by  2.69% to HK$343 (US$44.21) per share  from yesterday’s closing price of HK$334 (US$43.05) per share.

 The social and entertainment powerhouse reported nearly US$3.7 billion in profit, increasing by 29% from the same period in 2018. Additionally, the 2019 fiscal year saw Tencent report US$54.1 billion in revenue, a 21% year-on-year growth, and a net profit of US$13.5 billion. 
 “During 2019, we reinforced our leadership in consumer internet and extended our presence in industrial internet, while sustaining healthy operating and financial metrics,” said Pony Ma, CEO of Tencent, during the earnings call on Wednesday. 
 Revenues from value-added services, including games, video subscriptions, and music streaming, were 52.3 billion yuan (US$7.4 billion) in the quarter, up 20% year on year, or nearly half of the company’s total revenues. 
 Its online games revenue rose by 25% year on year to 30.3 billion yuan (US$4.3 billion), owing to hit mobile video games such as  Peacekeeper Elite  (a Chinese rebrand of  Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds ), as well as contribution from Supercell, a Finnish gaming company known for popular titles like  Clash of Clans . Tencent became the Helsinki-based company’s largest shareholder in October 2019. 
 Online advertising revenue increased by 19% year on year to 20.2 billion yuan (US$2.9 billion). Social and other advertising revenues grew by 37% to 16.3 billion yuan (US$2.3 billion), primarily driven by advertising on WeChat Moments. The increase offset the drop in media advertising from Tencent Video and Tencent News. 
 Tencent’s revenues from the fintech and business services sectors saw year-on-year growth of 39%, reaching 29.9 billion yuan (US$4.2 billion) in the fourth quarter. The number of commercial payments recorded through WeChat Pay reached a new high, with over 1 billion commercial transactions per day. 
 However, Tencent’s sprawling empire is expected to take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak, which forced shops to stop operations and customers to stay home. On the other hand, its digital entertainment business may see a surge in the first quarter of 2020 with the sector booming as people stay home. 
 “We saw in February and the early part of March is that there was a very substantial negative impact on offline transactions,” James Mitchell, chief strategy officer at Tencent, said during the earnings call on Wednesday. 
 Tencent’s cloud services revenues exceeded 17 billion yuan (US$2.4 billion) in 2019. Tencent’s cloud service, office collaboration application, and educational service, including Tencent Meeting and WeChat Work, have played a major role in the nationwide “remote-work experiment” in the period after the Chinese New Year.

642729,"Zomato reportedly entering grocery delivery via Grofers, BigBasket tie-up","  Zomato  is looking to enter the online grocery delivery scene as the Covid-19 outbreak slows down food delivery orders. 
 The restaurant discovery app is in talks with local online grocery startups Grofers and BigBasket to offer food products and other essentials on its platform, the  Economic Times  reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. 
 The new feature, tentatively called Zomato Market, is understood to be rolled out next week.

 According to the report, the collaboration may see Grofers’ offline partner stores listed on Zomato’s app. Users will then be able to place a delivery order that will be fulfilled by Zomato. 
 The service is expected to be piloted in India’s national capital region, though the sources noted that the talks are still in the early stages. 
  Tech in Asia  has reached out to Zomato, Grofers, and BigBasket for a statement on the matter. 
 Food ordering online has seen numbers fall by as much as 20%. Grocery deliveries and mom and pop stores, on the other hand, have seen a major uptick in demand, as people hoard groceries and other goods over fears of the novel coronavirus, according to the  Economic Times .    
 “The delivery fleet needs to be better optimized at this time of uncertainty. Considering grocery is in high demand, this makes sense for all players involved,” another person briefed on the situation said. 
 With the move, Zomato will potentially enter a space that its rival Swiggy has had a presence in for a little over a year now. Called Swiggy Stores, the feature lets local small- and medium-sized enterprises list their products such as groceries and medicines online. 
 The service, which was integrated into Swiggy’s existing mobile app, was  piloted  in Gurugram in February 2019. Swiggy then partnered with Jumbotail, an online marketplace for wholesalers, in September 2019 to set up warehouses and facilitate hyperlocal deliveries.

641911,The rise of embedded finance companies," Embedded finance refers to non-financial companies that significantly increase or even transform their value propositions through embedding associated financial products and services onto their platforms. 
 Essentially, these companies are embracing the trend of non-fintech companies venturing into financial services, and the first-, second-, and third- order implications of such a macro trend. 
 With this article, we at Saison Capital want to answer three main questions: 
 
 How and why does this trend play out in the tech and financial ecosystem? 
 What and who has been investing in embedded finance companies? 
 What are the different buckets of opportunity that exist in the market today? 
 
 We believe that startups of almost every vertical can and may move into financial services. It is not just about being better and more tech-driven or taking more risks. It is also about finding opportunities to combine data, process, and capital in ways that accomplish the same “jobs to be done.” 
 Embedded finance companies have an edge to distribute financial services because of distribution, data, and resources, and there are already examples of these across multiple verticals – from search engines (Google with Google Bank), ride-hailing (Grab with GrabPay), to marketplaces (Amazon with Amazon Pay). 
   
 Evolution and trends 
 At a high level, we see a three-step evolution in financial services. 
 First, financial services originated from banks and other such generalist financial institutions. For example, bank transfers were the only means of transferring money from one entity to another. 
 Second, a slew of first-wave fintech companies emerged. These firms were focused on using technology to enable financial services outside of/on top of a traditional banking process. For example, PayPal allowed people to make payments online. 
 Third, financial services were democratized. This resulted in specific financial transactions (potentially segmented by customer or industry type) that are better served or distributed by specific non-fintech platforms. For example, WeChat Pay can now be used for peer-to-peer transfers. 
   
 We see this trend happening across multiple core functions of fintech. If we break down the role of capital and value, we see three core functions: 
 
 Transferring/storing value in space 
 Transferring/storing value in time 
 Managing the entropy in value (inflation, etc.) 
 
   
 Examples of companies that are tackling the different verticals include financial arms WeChat Pay, Udaan Credit, Shopify Capital, Grab Financial, and Uber Insurance. 
   
 We also see a range of corporate venture arms as well as generalist venture capital firms investing in embedded finance companies across all stages and types of verticals – from healthcare to ride-hailing. 
   
 Doing a global scan of embedded finance companies, we see startups taking advantage of unbundling the different stages of the financial value chain. In general, there are three main stages we see that correlate with the sophistication of the financial ecosystem in the region. 
 The first stage focuses on the distribution of financial services through an existing platform. This is more commonly present in Asia, where the central problem remains distribution and education. As such, these companies tend to focus on building an ecosystem of services that they aim to incorporate deeply across the value chain within their specific vertical. Companies in this space are Shopify, Udaan, Grab, etc. 
 The second stage focuses on connectivity between fintech and non-fintech companies. It is a recognition of the reality that financial services are incredibly difficult to manage well (especially by companies without institutional knowledge and moats of capital). 
 The catalysts for this are twofold: Regulators insisting products and services remain under the purview of banks, and banks looking to participate in the forefront of financial technology. By focusing on connectivity, these companies proliferate financial services. Companies in this space include financial services firms Flexmoney, Plaid, Instacred, etc. 
 The third stage focuses on the native integration of financial processes through an existing platform. As the ecosystems on these platforms become larger with increasing payment/transaction flows, dependency on external financial processes (payment processing, facilitation, etc) becomes more noticeable. 
 While building and maintaining such services in-house may not make economic sense, startups are empowering business-to-business companies to adopt white-label financial processes into their digital ecosystems. 
   
 Vast opportunities in embedded finance 
 We did a high-level mapping of what potential opportunities could look like across different parts of the financial value chain, across different industry verticals. Here’s a selection of them below: 
   
 The opportunities for embedded finance, particularly in Asia, are extremely exciting as digitalization takes place across traditional industries, allowing financial services to be built on top of traditionally non-fintech companies. 
 As embedded finance companies continue to unbundle financial processes, we expect this trend to be replicated in ecosystems around the world.

642426,Singapore company turns bread to beer to cut Southeast Asia’s food waste,"  Why let bread go to waste if you can drink it?  
  Bakeries toss out a lot of unsold bread that are close to expiry. That’s why Singapore-based  Crust Brewing  is giving these items a new lease on life and turning leftover croissants and baguettes into beer. In the future, the brewer has aspirations to expand into Vietnam, one of the  fastest-growing    beer markets in the world.   
  “Think about Vietnam and all their leftover baguettes,” Travin Singh, the founder and CEO of Crust Brewing, tells  Tech in Asia . “That’ll be a resource that would never run out.”

  The company is expanding overseas to tap into the rising demand for beer across Asia Pacific, which Euromonitor crowned as the biggest market for the drink. Case in point, people in the region consumed some 69 billion liters of beer in 2018.   
  Crust Brewing entered the Singapore market last April after months of polishing its bread-to-beer process. It has so far received seed funding of S$30,000 (about US$21,000) from Enterprise Singapore, a government agency supporting business development in the city-state.   
  In theory, using surplus bread, which technically costs nothing, as one of the main ingredients for a product that retails for S$12 to S$17 (about US$9 to US$13) a pint sounds like the ideal business model. However, Singh reveals that the company’s profits are “small.”  
  Most of Crust Brewing’s margins go into operational costs, as only 30% of the grains used in the beer-making process is replaced with bread. As the startup doesn’t own any of its equipment, it rents out breweries, which Singh says is “very expensive.”   
  The CEO, however, plans to change that soon.   
  Crust Brewing is looking to acquire a brewery through funds it will raise from an investor who also owns a distillery. The fresh capital will go into developing new processes and products and finding new ways to keep costs low as well.  
  “We’re going to keep working on turning bread into viable whisky and gin to export it worldwide but never losing our focus on the usage of surplus products,” Singh says. “We’ll also work toward establishing our own microbrewery that features a full circular ecosystem that’s based on beer and bread.”  
  Ugly problem  
  The company is among a growing troupe of startups that are coming up with innovative solutions to tackle the big, ugly problem of food waste in Southeast Asia. Venture capital and private equity firms are beginning to notice the potential of these enterprises, injecting nearly US$20 billion into the nascent industry in 2019 –  a 250% increase over five years .  
  In Southeast Asia, high-profile deals for startups in the space include Malaysia-based  Nutrition Technologies ’ US$8.5 million series A funding round in 2019. The company uses black soldier fly (BSF) larvae to break down agricultural waste. The insects are also turned into fish and livestock feed, as well as pet food.   
 “Food waste is a big problem,” says Bennett Lee, the investment director at Singapore-based  Velocity Ventures . “Sustainability is something that has gotten consumers, corporations, and investors thinking. It’s a very real problem, as it will affect people in the current generation and the ones to come.” 
  Velocity Ventures invests between US$500,000 to US$1.5 million in the seed to series A funding rounds of startups across Southeast Asia. It focuses on travel and hospitality enterprises as well as food and beverage companies.   
  In January, the firm took part in a S$750,000 (US$557,000)  seed funding round    for Singaporean startup  Lumitics , which aims to help restaurants and kitchens reduce food waste and improve their bottom lines.   
  Its flagship solution, Insight, is a smart food waste tracker that uses sensors and image recognition technology to identify the type of food being discarded. It then generates data – such as the portion of a dish that’s thrown away at a buffet – to help businesses reduce waste, save costs, and improve their environmental footprints.   
  The company’s CEO, Rayner Loi, said that the tech has helped customers reduce their food wastage by some 30% to 40%, lowering operating costs by about 3% to 8%.   
  Now that its tech has been tested and commercialized, Lumitics tells  Tech in Asia  that it’s planning to raise a series A round in “12 to 15 months” to scale up their business around Asia Pacific and the Middle East. “Our competitors have a large presence in the US and Europe, but not in those two regions. It’s an open market for us there at this point, and we want to capitalize on that opportunity,” says Loi.

  While many startups take on waste at the end of the consumer food cycle, another company,  Confetti Fine Foods , takes a different approach. It turns “ugly” vegetables – those that would otherwise not have made it on supermarket shelves – into artisanal snacks.   
  New York-based  Big Idea Ventures  invested an undisclosed amount in the Singaporean company, founder Andrew Ive tells  Tech in Asia . Although the venture firm focuses mainly on backing alternative protein companies, many of the startups in its portfolio have an impact on waste management, he adds.  
  Why the focus on Asia?  
  Globally, about 1.3 billion tonnes of food go to waste every year – enough to feed 2 billion people annually, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. Southeast Asia makes up about a quarter of that tally.   
  Although the region is home to some of the poorest communities in the world, most of the wastage is due to inefficiencies in agricultural production. The UN’s World Food Programme estimates that the problem  cost the global economy US$1 trillion in 2019.   
  It’s crucial for Asia to tackle this environmental problem. Companies such as Nutrition Technologies view the region’s growing food waste as an affordable raw material to produce animal feed.    
  “Southeast Asia is a great place to kick off production,” says Thomas Berry, the chief operating officer of Nutrition Technologies. “Not only due to the abundance of raw materials from plantations but because of the tropical weather – it’s perfect for insect production.”

  The company has broken even and turned a gross profit margin of 50% to 60%, says Berry. He acknowledges that although the firm is making a loss because of its plans to scale, the US$1 to US$1.5 gross profit they make per kilogram of insect powder sold will be maintained.   
  Like Nutrition Technologies,  Entobel  is another BSF-based startup. It raised US$2 million from its seed and series A funding rounds, which it used to produce about 1,000 tons of insect powder for animal feed in 2019.   
  Ahead of its series B funding round in June, its co-founder, Gaetan Crielaard, says that they are on the “right track” in terms of cost structure and competitiveness. The fresh capital it banks from the series B round will go into financing the development of a production site in Vietnam that will boost its output tenfold to 10,000 tons.  
  Crust Brewing is also doing its part to reduce food waste in Singapore. According to the Singapore Food Agency, bread wastage alone has increased by a staggering 40% between 2008 and 2018 in the city-state.  
  The startup has tied up with bakeries such as Maison Kayser and Tiong Bahru Bakery, and Singapore online supermarket site Redmart to collect as much unwanted bread, says Singh. Redmart also sells Crust Brewing’s beer on its platform.  
  “Neither are we stopping at beer nor at bread,” Singh says. ”Basically, our motto is to just help F&amp;B establishments convert their waste into something better.”   ",Joseph Gan,0,6,"[(0, 0.8082843), (1, 0.19163923)]","['Insight', 'BSF', 'Singh', 'Berry', 'UN']","['US', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'Malaysia', 'Vietnam', 'Tech']"
642712,Indonesian biotech startup Nusantics closes seed round led by East Ventures,"  Nusantics , an Indonesia-based genomics technology company, announced that it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding in a round led by East Ventures. 
 The startup will use the fresh funds to establish a direct-to-consumer microbiome analysis service in Indonesia, Sharlini Eriza Putri, CEO of Nusantics, told  Tech in Asia .

 Founded in 2019, Nusantics claims to be the first local startup that can analyze microbiome profiles to fulfill consumer needs and support a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. It will initially introduce its technology to the Indonesian lifestyle market by applying it for the human skin, a living ecosystem of billions of microbiomes. 
 A microbiome is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi that live on and inside every human and living thing on earth. It is instrumental to the immune system, and each person’s profile is unique. 
 Nusantics said that understanding one’s own microbiome profile will help consumers pick the right beauty and body products that fit their needs. It aims to address the gap between the lack of understanding of microbiome balance and an increasing demand for conscious lifestyle and education. 
 “Advancement in deep tech has enabled us to realize that all lives on earth are interdependent on the microbiome. They are a crucial factor behind a healthy ecosystem, yet are also a very critical factor behind global pandemics,” the chief exec said. 
 Citing data from Nielsen and Euromonitor, the startup said that Indonesia’s beauty market reached US$2.3 billion in 2018, with skincare products contributing around 31.7%. 
 Nusantics was established by Putri, Vincent Kurniawan, and Revata Utama, whose backgrounds include engineering, genomics technology, manufacturing, and biotech, among others. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(3, 0.9995712)]","['Nusantics', 'Putri']","['Asia', 'earth', 'Indonesia']"
642677,"Uber considers suspending ride-sharing in India after US, Canada"," Covid-19 might hurt Uber as the US-ride hailing and food delivery app considers extending the suspension of its ride-sharing services in markets outside the US and Canada. 
 Several people with knowledge of the matter tell  Tech in Asia  that Uber may decide to stop offering its Uber Pool service in India as early as next week. If the suspension is implemented, it’s unclear how long it would last, the sources add. 
 A spokeswoman for Uber said the company doesn’t have any specific updates to share. 
 
   Source: Uber  
 
 On March 17, Uber temporarily pulled the plug on its ride-sharing services in the US and Canada to help “ flatten the curve  on community spread in the cities we serve,” said Andrew Macdonald, Uber’s senior vice president of global rides and platform,  in a statement . The company is evaluating similar measures in other countries, reported  TechCrunch . 
 Fierce battle 
 India is seen as Uber’s  last foothold  in Asia. Despite gaining wide adoption in the country, Uber is facing hurdles in raising prices and pivoting towards profitability. It’s locked in a fierce battle with homegrown ride-hailer Ola that results in lower fees for users. The SoftBank-backed firm is also rapidly expanding to international markets where Uber is present. 
 There’s no word on whether Ola will suspend its own ride-sharing services in India. 
 Uber’s decision comes after India’s federal government and the state government of Maharashtra took measures to implement social distancing as  Covid-19 cases continue to go up . Financial capital Mumbai, is in Maharashtra, one of the country’s most prosperous states. 
 Most corporate organizations in India began implementing work-from-home policies on March 16, while startups have asked for a  further lockdown  in the next two to three weeks. 
 India, the world’s second-most populous country, now has 148 confirmed cases with four deaths, its  health ministry  said. A dashboard for latest statistics on Covid-19 in India can be found  here . 
 Bumpy road 
 Most of Uber India’s users choose to share rides, according to people familiar with the matter. Sharing a ride via UberPool is cheaper compared to other options on the app, making it a popular choice in the country. Uber hasn’t provided a breakdown of the numbers for its different ride services.

 Discontinuing ride-sharing services – even temporarily – will be a further setback for Uber in key emerging markets. 
 Uber  sold  its Southeast Asia business to Grab in March 2018 in return for a 27.5% stake in the business. This followed Uber’s move to exit  Russia  in 2017 and  China  the year before. 
 Uber is also not fully benefiting from the huge surge in food deliveries in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In January, Zomato  bought   Uber’s food delivery business in the country in an all-stock deal that gave the US ride-hailing firm a 9.99% stake in the Indian restaurant aggregator.

 “Our target is to remain innovative in helping Indonesian students reach their maximum potential and feel the thrill of learning,” said Pahamify CEO Rousyan Fikri. 
 This is the first non-grant investment received by Pahamify. Y Combinator and YouTube previously gave an undisclosed amount of grant money to the company. 
 “Even though they [Y Combinator] liked our concept and gave us a grant before, they were still reluctant to invest. Thanks to the support of Pahamifren [Pahamify users] who have believed in and used Pahamify since we started, we could survive,” said Fikri. 
 The CEO added that Pahamify is listed among Y Combinator’s winter 2020 batch, together with two other Indonesian startups Newman’s and YukStay.

642659,"Gojek says transport business has been profitable, denies layoffs"," 
  Andre Soelistyo, CEO of Gojek (right) / Photo credit: Gojek 
 
 Gojek CEO Andre Soelistyo told employees during an internal town hall meeting late Thursday that the company’s transportation business has been profitable for “a few months.” He did not provide more details. It’s also not clear if he was referring to gross or net profitability. 
 Gojek’s overall business, which includes food delivery and a payment gateway, remains unprofitable, Soelistyo noted. The company’s ex-CEO, Nadiem Makarim, said in  late 2018  that Gojek is “extremely close” to reaching profitability in all its segments, except transportation. 
 Chief rival Grab, meanwhile, has been saying that it’s “profitable in mature markets for its mature verticals.” 
 During the town hall, Soelistyo expressed that he’s worried about how Covid-19 might impact consumer demand down the road. He also denied a recent report by  DealStreetAsia  that says Gojek has undertaken a wave of layoffs affecting over 100 mid- and lower-level employees. The Indonesian unicorn did not immediately reply to the publication on the matter. 
 However, some companies reduce their headcount by nudging people to resign – either by giving them an unattractive option of relocating to another city or country for another job within the company, changing or reducing their job scope, or cutting their pay. 
 Such moves could save companies money. Indonesia’s rules on severance pay are one of the  most   generous  in the world. 
 Gojek did not respond to  Tech in Asia’s  request for comment. 
 In addition, Soelistyo said that news about merger talks between Grab and Gojek, which was first reported by the  The Information , is false. 
 “There are no plans for any sort of merger, and recent media reports regarding discussions of this nature are not accurate,” a Gojek representative told  Tech in Asia  in February. 
 “Optimistic scenario” 
 In December last year, Gojek  shut down  its GoLife services, which include on-demand services like cleaning and laundry. It’s unclear if the move involved layoffs. 
 More recently, the company raised  US$1.2 billion  in fresh funding amid a worsening economy, giving it ammunition to fight Grab. 
 Taken at face value, the news that Gojek’s transportation arm is profitable will give it – and even Grab – a boost. Makarim told the  Nikkei Asian Review  that an “optimistic scenario” would be for Gojek to turn its ride-hailing business profitable. 
  See:  An analysis of Gojek and Grab’s valuations and profitability prospects   
 Indeed, the rivals have been touting their food delivery and fintech businesses over ride-hailing, given the common view that it’s easier to turn a profit on the non-transportation arms. 
 A Goldman Sachs analysis seen by  Tech in Asia  says that the super apps will likely draw profitability from their financial arms, with transportation likely to lose money in the foreseeable future.

642648,This startup eyes larger pie of China’s online procurement market,"  This article is co-written by Daniel Boltinsky.  
 Last month,  Yijiupi , a company hardly known outside of China, made an acquisition that could change an industry worth billions of dollars. 
 The procurement platform, used by over 800,000 brick-and-mortar businesses to buy products for resale, acquired ZShuaixiao, a smaller competitor in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market with a strong presence in southern China.

 The deal, financial details of which were undisclosed, is a step towards consolidation in China’s highly fragmented online procurement industry, where dozens of startups compete with big players like JD.com and Alibaba, as well as traditional suppliers, to give storefronts goods at the lowest prices. 
 Started by Wang Chaocheng and Cheng Shengqiang, the company, which initially specialized in liquor, saw rapid growth by undercutting middlemen resellers, who – between manufacturers and low-level salesman – can pass a significant markup on a premium bottle of liquor to the store on the street. From 2016, the firm has expanded to offer a wide range of FMCGs goods, growing its presence in the market. 
 “By 2018, about 70% of all mom-and-pop stores had procured online, and the frequency and amount of online procurement have been growing,” said, Cao Yi, founding partner of Source Code Capital, which is among Yijiupi’s investors. “Online procurement is an irreversible trend and the FMCG market is huge. We firmly believe that in this wave, a national, all-brand, multi-channel supply chain giant will come into being.” 
 With the acquisition of ZShuaixiao, Yijiupi seeks a dominant role in the FMCG market by expanding its product offering and gaining a stronger foothold in Fujian and Guandong, said Yijiupi’s co-founder Cheng Shengqiang. The firm also recently completed an undisclosed series D4 round of financing, with investments from DragonBall Capital, GLP, and Source Code Capital. 
 Major Chinese tech firms like Tencent and Meituan Diaping were also part of the company’s US$200 million series D completed in September 2018, raising its valuation above US$1 billion the same year. 
 In 2019, Yijiupi hit 20 billion yuan (US$2.87 billion) in gross merchandise volume (GMV), and expanded its services to over 800,000 users across 138 cities, including large supermarkets and restaurants. By comparison, Huimin, another procurement startup, had 600,000 stores in 2018, while Best Store+ had 430,000 users by the end of September of 2019. 
 Yijiupi’s growth has put the company in the position to challenge other big players in the storefront supply market such as Alibaba’s Lingshoutong, which serves over 1 million physical stores in China. 
 However, by pursuing major growth outside of liquor sales, Yijiupi also walks a thin line: In trying to do more, the procurement platform risks losing its edge by becoming master of none. Its acquisition of ZShuaixiao, along with the new funding, will prove crucial in overcoming this challenge. 
 Zhang Hui, who operates four grocery stores in Beijing, started using Yijiupi in 2017 when he noticed their low prices for bottled water. As a store owner, he has become adept at wedging margins when he sees them. Indeed, storefronts’ notoriously low margins are a characteristic that makes it difficult for a massive, consolidated platform to exist—highly savvy buyers are willing to change platforms if they see a better deal. 
 “Each one has its merits and demerits, and all are useful,” Zhang told  KrAsia . 
 Yijiupi is best for liquor, he said, while Huimin has a wider selection of goods and gives great loans (he got 400,000 yuan at no interest to be used with the company). Best Store+ offers a reliable logistics service, while Zhangguibao offers affordable electronics directly from manufacturers. Lingshoutong is the go-to destination for rare and low-volume products, he added. 
 Besides deals and lower prices⁠ – which are sometimes only marginally better than traditional suppliers⁠ – these new procurement platforms offer another key advantage. Their knowledge and closer cooperation with manufacturers within their areas of specialization, along with the traceability of ecommerce transactions, makes them less likely to offer fakes products when compared to traditional brick and mortar distributors, according to Zhang. 
 While the coronavirus outbreak has been disrupting businesses in China, the acquisition of ZShuaixiao⁠ – which had 100,000 clients in Guangdong and Fujian provinces before the deal⁠ – puts Yijiupi in a prime position to reap the rewards once the country’s economic engine resumes moving at full speed, said one analyst. 
 “The acquisition of ZShuaixiao will strengthen Yijiupi’s position in the market, giving the company better capability to weather the coronavirus crisis than smaller competitors,” Wu Di told  KrAsia . “When the Covid-19 crisis is finally over, the FMCG sector will witness a tremendous rebound and business-to-business ecommerce players, as the business-to-customer consumer sector’s upstream players, will benefit.”

It offers credit underwriting solutions and analytical models, among others, to make the Indian debt capital markets more inclusive and efficient. 
 According to Vivriti co-founders Gaurav Kumar and Vineet Sukumar, the company has facilitated deal flows of over US$3.3 billion since its inception. 
 It now looks to use the new funds to “ramp up the technology and the analytical engine powering the online marketplace and to shore up the balance sheet lending of the company,” the co-founders said. 
 To date, Vivriti claims to have around 2,000 users, over 250 issuers, and more than 120 investors on its platform. Key participants on the platform include major banks, nonbanking financial companies, mutual fund houses, development banks, and family offices. 
 LGT Lightstone Aspada is the India-focused arm of global impact investment firm LGT Lightstone, providing early-stage risk capital to companies based in the country. 
 The private equity and VC firm recently backed microlending startup  Smartcoin , leading its  US$7 million  series A raise. In contrast to Vivriti, Smartcoin focuses on providing small-ticket personal loans to micro merchants, self-employed, and salaried individuals in India.

642617,A closer look at Grab’s efforts to serve up the ideal food delivery ecosystem," Remember when “food delivery” meant ordering a pizza over the phone? The industry has come a long way since then, with mobile apps offering more convenient ways to order, and from much larger menus. 
 The growth of the food delivery scene in Southeast Asia has been exponential. These apps were once used by 10% to 20% of people in urban locations across the region, but that has since risen to  over 50%  and is expected to keep increasing. 
 The secret sauce 
 This growth is driven by innovation and technology at companies like Grab, for instance. At the tech firm’s  GrabFood  arm, a combination of factors like data analytics, artificial intelligence, and cloud kitchens are driving localization, food variety, and personalization efforts. 
 All of that is in service to a larger vision. 
 “We are building an integrated food ecosystem that delivers the greatest choice and convenience to consumers and provides sustainable revenue opportunities for delivery and merchant partners,” says Suthen Thomas, chief technology officer of deliveries at Grab.

 The company strives for the “perfect experience”: Users’ orders are placed in seconds, delivery partners step into restaurants just as the food is served, and the meal reaches consumers in the best condition. 
 To this end, GrabFood’s tech teams have rolled out over 130 front-end and back-end tech enhancements over the past year. The company’s back-end analyzes millions of attributes to give more personalized recommendations and reduce inefficiencies from order to delivery. 
 Thomas gives the example of optimizing the delivery process. “We’ve built a model that allows us to assign orders that are suited to different delivery modes,” he explains. “Orders that can be completed faster on footpaths are allocated to cyclists, while routes that are mostly on flat roads and with proper footpaths are prioritized for wheelchair-bound partners.” 
 It also predicts which delivery partners can deliver orders in the fastest time based on location, food preparation time estimation, real-time and historical traffic data, delivery distance, and more, Thomas says. 
 Delivery partners are then guided to take the most efficient routes and go to the right drop-off points. “For the consumer, we want to get food to them fast, and for our delivery partners, our goal is to reduce any idle time and allow them to earn more,” he adds. 
 It’s an approach that takes every step of the process into consideration and optimizes it – in fact, this has helped Grab’s delivery partners perform 60% more orders per hour, says Thomas.

 Beyond fundamentals 
 The insights that Grab gleans go towards improving the user experience in other ways. 
 “By looking at the types of food and drinks consumers order and search for frequently, we come to understand trends and preferences,” says Thomas. “With these insights, we co-create innovative and exclusive menu items with merchant partners and offer them exclusively to GrabFood users – it’s about finding unique ways to add value to consumers and merchants.” 
 He points out that these efforts are also put into analyzing  food demand gaps  that exist in the cities the firm operates in, and then closing them by establishing and expanding cloud kitchen networks. This gives consumers access to more cuisine options and helps merchants extend their reach. 
 This is made possible by Grab’s machine learning and AI models, which enable the company to understand consumer preferences at scale. “We want to provide personalized restaurant recommendations and relevant deals to consumers,” says Thomas. 
 The improved discovery and recommendations on the app has made it twice as likely for consumers to find something they like. 
 The GrabFood team keeps working to perfect the fundamental factors of delivery times and menu expansions and introducing functions that can boost convenience. Beyond food delivery, Grab is also planning to bring  GrabMart  and Self Pick-up, its digital takeaway service, to more locations. 
 “Self Pick-up enables consumers to beat the queue by placing their orders through GrabFood first and picking them up when ready for collection,” says Thomas. “We’re also building a group ordering feature that will enable different people to directly add their orders to a shared basket.” 
 These initiatives are aimed at addressing evolving consumer preferences,  providing the convenience that many in the region seek . The idea is to make the entire food experience as seamless as possible. 
 Adapting to a diverse region 
 With  differing levels of digital capability and adoption across Southeast Asia , building the food delivery ecosystem isn’t a straightforward task. To address this, Grab uses  different models  in certain markets to cater to merchants who are in the early stages of digitizing their operations as well as those that are already active participants of the digital economy. 
 In Singapore, all its merchants are on the integrated delivery model, which allows them to manage their online storefront on the app. But in markets such as Indonesia, where small businesses may not be as digitally ready, Grab also offers the concierge model, where the GrabFood order goes directly to the delivery partner, who goes to the restaurant and manually makes the order. 
 The concierge model, however, is not without its drawbacks. It’s not as efficient as the integrated model, and there are inconveniences such as finding out the item is sold out only when the delivery partner arrives at the store. That said, it still plays an important role as an entry point into the digital economy for many small businesses that are new to tech, Thomas observes. 
 As it works with merchants both big and small, Grab also customizes its solutions according to the needs and operations of its partners. “Larger chains tend to have more established processes and come to us for more specific needs. For example, we directly integrate with the systems of large merchants so that the orders go straight to their point-of-sale as well as kitchen management systems,” Thomas describes. 
 He adds, “Some chains may already have their own delivery fleet but want to reach more customers through our app, while others need help with delivery.” 
 Thomas thinks that customization is the way to go in a region as diverse as Southeast Asia. “We have to localize technology and tailor our solutions to make it accessible for people and businesses.”

 Adjusting to extraordinary times 
 As the Covid-19 pandemic continues, limiting exposure is a concern for many. Addressing this, GrabFood has introduced a contactless delivery option where customers can have their food dropped off outside their door instead of receiving it directly. It’s also working with merchants to set up contactless takeaway stations to ensure delivery partners do not come into close contact with merchants. 
 With more cities going into lockdown, the offline traffic for food businesses has taken a hit. “SMEs are the backbone of Southeast Asia and we see it as our responsibility to help them tide over this difficult time,” says Thomas. “We’re working hard to take their businesses online so that they can continue to earn a living and take care of their families.”

 The consortium is proposing a banking-as-a-service platform that would provide safe banking services and serve gig workers and small and medium-sized enterprises. 
 According to Shailesh Naik, the founder and group CEO of MatchMove, the startup has formed a network of fintech businesses with a large access to retail customers and SMEs. 
 Without being specific, he said that confirmed partners include a leading transport operator in Singapore, a leading insurance company in Southeast Asia, a regional payments acquirer, two startups focused on SME services, and an ecommerce enabler in Asia, among others. Naik added that the consortium is in advanced talks with other potential partners. 
 He said that the move would allow the digital bank to reach more customers with “minimal additional customer acquisitions costs” and make its services available “at a lower cost than traditional banking.” 
 The full digital banking bid is a natural next step for MatchMove, according to the statement. The startup currently offers what it calls a wallet-as-a-service platform, enabling customers to spend both online and offline via prepaid cards on major card networks. It also supports peer-to-peer domestic money transfers, cross-border remittances, as well as person-to-merchant and mass disbursements to global recipients. 
 MatchMove also offers lending services, where credit scores are assigned based on customers’ spending and sending patterns to offer customized lending solutions. 
 It has offices in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. 
 For financing company Singapura Finance, the consortium’s move would enable the established firm to diversify into new digital segments and products, its CEO Jamie Teo said. 
 Lightnet, a Thai clearing and settlement network that leverages blockchain, said that the partnership is in line with its regional banking objectives. The company targets unbanked migrant workers and the SME trade finance segment in Southeast Asia. 
 UK-based fintech company OpenPayd, meanwhile, sees the collaboration as an opportunity to expand its footprint in Asia.

642500,Two models emerge from latest wave of co-living startups in Indonesia," The concept of co-living has taken root in many markets as an alternative to typical modes of urban dwelling, such as renting or sharing apartments. But in many cities across Indonesia, the concept of  kost  – which is similar to co-living in that residents rent a room in a building while sharing common spaces like the kitchen and lounge – has long existed as an affordable option. 
 As the urban population across Asia Pacific  keeps rising , Indonesia presents a huge opportunity because it’s expected to have the third-largest growth in urban population after China and India, according to a survey by real estate consultancy Jones Lang Lasalle.

 Indonesian startups have sprouted to bring technology-based solutions to this vertical. Initially, the players were mainly aggregators including Kakao Ventures-backed Mamikos or Infokost, which list available  kost  accommodations for customers to discover. In comparison, other companies such as Travelio focus on apartment listings. 
 While aggregation platforms are still around, a second wave of  kost -related businesses are entering the market. Instead of just listings, these relative newcomers also provide a standardized, branded experience. 
 Two distinct approaches 
 Among them are RedDoorz, which recently launched a product called KoolKost. Like the company’s core budget hotel product, KoolKost works with individual  kost  operators to provide basic amenities such as free WiFi, routine room cleaning service, and fresh linens. 
 “The  kost  market is still relatively unorganized and highly fragmented, with most local organizations unable to provide a good quality, standardized stay experience,” says RedDoorz founder and CEO Amit Saberwal. “Consumers are looking for simplicity and efficiency.” 
 RedDoorz’s competitors in the hotel space also have similar  kost  services in Indonesia. In late 2019, Oyo rolled out Oyo Life, its brand for long-term accommodations, with 2,500 rooms across eight cities in the country. It’s unclear, though, how much the Indian unicorn is investing in that business unit, given the ongoing  downsizing  of its loss-making hotel business. 
 Other rivals include  Flokq  as well as  RoomMe , a portfolio company of Vertex Ventures, and Rukita, which counts Sequoia’s Surge accelerator program, Silicon Valley’s Lightspeed Venture Partners, and the investment firm of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar as investors. 
 Another approach is represented by East Ventures-backed  CoHive , which began as an operator of co-working spaces before  joining the co-living fray . 
 “We believe co-living complements co-working,” says Jason Lee, co-founder and chief executive officer of CoHive. “The first question our CoHive members ask us when they move into our co-working space is, ‘Do you have someplace for myself or my teams to live at?’ That’s where it all began.”

  Wellspaces , a company founded by the managing partner of Grupara Ventures, also started out with co-working before venturing into co-living via a sub-brand called Dwell. It currently has two locations in Jakarta. 
 Of course, each of the models has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. CoHive fully operates its co-living spaces, which presumably gives it greater control over the experience and a higher share of margins. There’s also an emphasis on community and experience, which distinguishes it from the usual  kost . 
 “We have a community/facility manager physically present at the site who helps connect people and organize events and activities,” shares Lee. “This is very different from  kost  where residents don’t even know their neighbors.” 
 Conversely, it also assumes a bigger share of all the associated risks. WeWork, for example, directly leases both its co-working and co-living spaces from building owners. That said, CoHive’s current location at Jakarta’s West Vista condominium was developed in partnership with its landlord – Singaporean property developer Keppel Land. 
 KoolKost, on the other hand, is asset-light: Instead of directly renting the spaces, it works with  kost  operators that either own or lease the venue. It then works to upgrade property quality, brand, market, and ultimately increase average occupancy, says RedDoorz boss Saberwal. 
 “For a large proportion of independent and boutique  kost  owners, there is still a lack of technology used for property management,” he observes, adding that those on KoolKost can benefit from RedDoorz’s proprietary tech solutions. 
 A room at CoHive starts from about 3.3 million rupiah (US$227) monthly, while a KoolKost room in Bendungan Hilir – a neighborhood adjacent to the central business district – costs 2.6 million rupiah (US$179) a month. This isn’t too different from what traditional  kost  operators charge at comparable areas, while a semi-furnished independent studio unit at the West Vista condominium (but not part of CoHive) can be rented out at 3.25 million rupiah (US$224). 
 Going to scale 
 Scalability is another key differentiating factor. At present, CoHive only has one co-living venue, but it has seen growth in the West Vista property. Having started out as a “test product” of 27 units on one floor, it has since expanded to over 100 contiguous rooms across three floors at nearly 100% occupancy, Lee says. 
 The company is also seeing “strong demand” from landowners and developers and are looking to branch out into other properties this year, he adds. 
 Thanks to its asset-light model, KoolKost already has over 100 properties across 14 cities in Indonesia, even though it was officially launched in January and first trialled in 2019. 
 It’s still early to tell which model will prevail, though it’s also entirely possible for the companies to coexist and occupy their own niches. That’s the scenario for Indonesia’s  furniture ecommerce startups , where two of the incumbents are Fabelio and Dekoruma. 
 Direct-to-consumer brand Fabelio manufactures its own products, which limits its scale but yields a higher margin. Meanwhile, Dekoruma, which functions as a platform, sells products from a variety of furniture brands, resulting in smaller margins/transaction fees but an overall larger scale.

 In neighboring Singapore, co-living startup  Hmlet  recently confirmed a round of layoffs as the company  pivots from the leasing model to an asset-light one . Instead of directly renting, renovating, and operating properties, the company will help landlords manage Hmlet-branded co-living spaces through a revenue-sharing arrangement. 
 The reason behind Hmlet’s overhaul is said to be pricey upfront and ongoing expenses. To an extent, that may be less of an issue in Indonesia, where operational and labor costs in particular can be lower compared to Singapore. However, this also means that average monthly membership or rental fees are probably cheaper as well, points out Co-Hive’s Lee. 
 “An asset-light model works when the branding and value-add to landlords is very strong and compelling,” he explains. “This works especially well when there is clear alignment of vision from both the operator and the landlord.” ",Putra Muskita,1,5,"[(0, 0.43166226), (1, 0.07904609), (2, 0.043188576), (3, 0.44610304)]","['Oyo', 'KoolKost', 'eBay', 'AFP', 'Mamikos', 'RedDoorz', 'Rukita', 'Dwell', 'Sequoia', 'CoHive']","['Jakarta', 'Singapore', 'Dekoruma', 'KoolKost', 'Fabelio', 'India', 'Indonesia', 'China', 'Infokost']"

 Existing investors SeedPlus, Found Ventures, and JobsCentral co-founder Huang Shao-Ning also participated in the round, which brought the startup’s total funding to S$4.5 million (US$3.1 million). 
 EngageRocket, which has just opened a new office in Jakarta, said it will use the new funds to strengthen its presence in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. 
 Established in 2016, the startup provides a cloud-based software that automates employee feedback and analytics to help organizations improve employee engagement and performance. 
 “Personalizing the employee journey using real-time data can yield up to 147% improvements in earnings per share and 21% gains in per-person productivity,” CheeTung Leong, the co-founder and CEO at EngageRocket, said. 
 The startup claims it has doubled its user base and grew its enterprise customer segment by over four times in the past 12 months. Its platform has analyzed over 2 million employee answers in 20 industries and 14 markets for clients such as StarHub, Tokopedia, Mediacorp, and Singapore Power. 
 With less than US$5 million annual recurring revenue and about 20 employees, EngageRocket now aims to triple its revenue in 2020 and double its headcount by adding engineering, people science, and customer-facing roles in each of its Southeast Asian markets, the company told  Tech in Asia . 
 “People spend more than half their waking lives at work, and many people tie their sense of identity and self-worth to what they do for a living,” Leong said. “EngageRocket aims to help leaders make a positive impact in people’s lives through work.”

641218,How short-video apps changed the advertising game in China," Since the launch of TikTok – called Douyin in China – in 2017, short videos have become the new obsession of Chinese internet users. For the first time, people are spending more time watching short videos than longer content. Case in point, internet users are  1.5x  more likely to watch online video on mobile devices.

 It quickly became one of the significant ways that Chinese netizens shared information. Today, short-video apps are among the  most-used  daily apps in China. 
 The reason is simple: They provide a new choice for people and fits their quick pace of life. That’s why most online advertisers in China put short-form video apps at the forefront of their marketing strategy – they’re a cost-effective way to interact with consumers. 
 Now that TikTok has overtaken Facebook to become the world’s second-most downloaded app, short videos have become a staple for online advertisers to market brands. 
 Data shows that online advertising revenue of short-video platforms grew by  43%  in 2019, compared to the average annual growth of 18% across platforms. In 2020, short-video advertising trends continue to show strong gains in the Chinese marketplace. 
 Why is it worth investing in short-video apps? 
 According to the China Netcasting Services Association, short-video app users occupy more than  74%  of those on mobile. In the country, the total number of people who use short-video apps stood at over  820 million  in 2019. This means that roughly 7.2 out of 10 mobile users have at least one short-video app on their devices. 
 This data is reasonable since TikTok, the most popular short-video app globally, has more than  400 million  daily active users in mainland China. On the other hand, the platform’s major rival, Kuaishou, hit  200 million  daily active users. 
 These companies leverage this massive opportunity with more features (stickers, filters, etc.) and campaigns to keep the excitement and make their users stick around. 
 For example, TikTok’s Hashtag Challenge is one of the most central engagement drivers on the platform, urging its users to post videos to participate in fun tasks. Meanwhile, Kuaishou makes use of its service with livestreaming features for users to build a more inclusive community. 
 Other apps like Meipai and Weishi are also keeping up by adding more endearing stickers and effects to appeal to its younger demographic. 
 The revenue of China’s short-video market reached  US$6.6 billion  in 2018, and that’s expected to  double in size  to US$11.8 billion this year. 
 But what makes online advertising on short-video apps effective? 
 Shorter attention span 
 In this era of immediacy, customers’ attention spans are getting shorter and shorter. They prefer platforms that are quick, but those that contain enough interesting information. This has been particularly valuable for most Chinese companies to start investing in short-video advertising. 
 With fun and creative content, short videos can deliver brand messages to a target audience impressively, even with just 15 seconds or less. 
 Fun and quirky content 
 Millennials and Generation Z love these new social media platforms and are generating a demand for them. Short-video apps allow these users to dance, jump, lip-sync, and even produce comedy skits. 
 That’s why these apps are mostly playgrounds for people born in the 1990s and later. About  75%  of the users in the short-video market are young people aged between 18 to 35 years old, which is an ideal demographic for advertisers. 
 How online advertisers make the best of short-videos apps 
 Female teenagers and pre-teens make up most of the users on these apps, which creates an exciting opportunity, especially for brands in fast-moving consumer goods, cosmetics, and fashion. 
 Most online advertisers in China use short videos for various types of promotional campaigns, such as product demo videos, product reviews, brand culture showcases, and the list goes on. 
 Some of them use influencers or celebrities (called key opinion leaders in China), who can help companies promote content or campaigns. Michael Kors, Pizza Hut, L’Oreal, and Oreo, are just a few well-known brand names that have run a campaign on Chinese short-video apps to reach more customers in the country. 
 What’s more interesting is that some of these apps, like TikTok and Kuaishou, have announced integrations with ecommerce giant Taobao. It makes these apps an ideal platform for cost-per-sales marketing. 
 When users play a video, for instance, companies can display a pop-up which, when clicked, links to a Taobao store selling products seen on the video. This shortens the buyer’s journey and even convinces the users to make a purchase. In this way, these apps are giving users quick access to online shopping, and at the same time, they can also watch short, entertaining videos. 
 Short videos: the next frontier for advertising in China 
 As over  42%  of product pages on Taobao already include short videos, the trend has become more like commercials. This means more tech companies will get involved in leveraging the craze. 
 Other ecommerce giants like Tmall and JD.com have already joined the league by teaming up with Kuaishou. These firms let users display their own products, which are listed on these sites, via a channel called Kuaishou Small Store. 
 Xiaomi has also tapped into the short-video craze by allowing TikTok users to buy its new smartphones directly through the app. 
 As a major rival to Alibaba, ecommerce firm Pinduoduo didn’t want to get left behind. It has jumped into the bandwagon by launching a short-video function called “Duoduo Video” in its app for product searches. 
 Now that short-video apps are moving into the ecommerce business to fight for user attention, there’s no disputing that the level of competition is ramping up. And that’s not to mention that more and more tech firms also prioritizing short videos in their marketing strategy to strengthen their online presence. 
 China’s obsession with online video apps has changed the advertising game. An increasing number of businesses have hopped on board the short-video trend, and search engine titan Baidu is not an exception. It has launched three short-video apps – Haokan, Nani, and Quanmin. However, none of them have beaten TikTok and Kuaishou in terms of popularity. 
 China is witnessing its own set of advertising changes to entertainment, and some of those changes are spreading beyond its borders. Marketing on short-video apps has become so globally popular that it has inspired even some of the world’s giants to launch their own platforms, like Google’s Tangi.

 LionRock Capital’s Hari Kumar, Artha Ventures, LetsVenture, Globevestor, CIIE.CO, as well as existing investor Speciale Invest also participated in the round. The startup received  US$423,000  in seed funding from Speciale last year. 
 Founded in 2017, Agnikul is developing a configurable satellite launch vehicle that can support a payload capacity of 30 to 100 kilograms. The engine is fully 3D-printed, allowing for an easier and cheaper fabrication process so launch vehicles can be delivered within a few weeks. 
 The company is trying to reduce the waiting time to put satellites in orbit, from about 12 to 18 months to 2 weeks or lesser, Srinath Ravichandran, co-founder and CEO at Agnikul, told  Tech in Asia . He added that the next plan for the company is to get from testing to assembly of its first product. 
 The startup will use the fresh capital for ground testing, fabrication, and team expansion, according to a statement. 
 Citing reports, Agnikul said the space industry across the globe has grown to be a US$350 billion market as many private players have entered the sector. It is predicted that over 2,500 small satellites will be launched by 2022, compared to less than 500 today. 
 “I have always believed that India has the potential and the talent to create world-beating IPs and products, not just in the digital domain but also beyond,” said Manish Singhal, founding partner at Pi Ventures. 
 There are about  120 spacetech startups in India , which raised a total of US$6.2 million in funding last year, according to a report. A reduction in launch costs and the Indian Space Research Organization’s effort to lower the manufacturing and production cost of satellites have attracted a growing number of startups in the sector.

 As the tourism and travel sector continues to grow globally, access to travel has never been easier, thanks to online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Expedia, Booking.com, and Agoda. 
 However, players in the space have evolved from pure OTAs that digitize the ticketing and booking process to platforms and marketplaces for local tour guides offering “experiences” to the more discerning traveler. 
 Between luxury travelers and backpackers, the middle tier composed of young and tech-savvy millennials are visiting Southeast Asia in droves, searching out experiences and holidays specific to their tastes. 
 Going beyond e-tickets 
 Looking toward integrating all stages of the booking process, from marketing to the point of purchase, the online travel sector hopes to expand the pie further by adopting and adapting to the myriad of online payment platforms available. 
 Traveloka and Tiket.com are the top two OTAs among Indonesian consumers due to their leading services for airline tickets, train tickets, and hotel reservations. Traveloka has extended operations to other major countries in Southeast Asia and has access to more than 40 different local payment options for consumers in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. 
 The company has also expanded its platform to focus on experience-based travelers, prompting other startups like Klook, a Hong Kong-based destination booking platform, to enter the Indonesian market with competitively priced travel experience packages. 
 Klook is trying to support local operators by further digitizing operations like booking and redemption, post-experience reviews, and AI-powered voice commands such as Google Assistant. 
 At the other end of the travel tech spectrum is Pollen, a UK-based invite-only marketplace that lets people bring their friends to the best local experiences and share rewards. The startup closed a series B funding round in October 2019, bringing its total war chest to US$88.5 million. 
 Regardless of where a company exists on the digital travel value chain, the one thing they will all inevitably have in common is the need for a variety of connected payment methods. This is a big part of why investors believe travel tech is poised to boom for a second time, following the prevalence of fintech in the region. 
 A marketplace of experiences 
 Travel experiences bring new meaning to the idea of “once in a lifetime,” as millennial travelers immerse themselves in local cultures rather than just playing bystander. 
  A 2018 study  by travel technology solutions provider Amadeus and pollster YouGov found that targeting millennials’ desire for new experiences is a golden opportunity for travel providers. 
 In the report, 27% of those surveyed are most interested in recommendations that expose them to new experiences, just below recommendations that help them save money (37%). As such, there are opportunities for local tour guides and homestays to personalize offerings and appeal to this segment of travelers. 
 On a large scale, online travel aggregators like Traveloka have invested in developing their local travel services, driven by the insight that for every dollar spent by travelers on flights and accommodations, a varying multiple of that is spent during the trip itself. 
 On a smaller scale, starting within their own borders, Southeast Asian travel tech startups have blossomed in the experiential space due to the need for hyperlocal marketing, vendor outreach, and product packaging. These startups include: 
   
 Playing to local strengths 
 The Google report expects Indonesia’s online travel sector to hit US$25 billion by 2025, accounting for around a third of the industry’s total value in the region. 
 Indonesia boasts the second-fastest tourism growth in Southeast Asia and ninth worldwide, according to recent data from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). 
 Cognizant of the country’s diverse travel offerings – thanks in large part to its archipelago of more than 17,000 islands – the Indonesian government launched the Wonderful Indonesia initiative in 2011 to take the country’s tourism, culture, and customs global. In addition, community-based programs like Village Tourism were launched to bring more tourist attention to hyperlocal attractions. 
 Currently, the momentum of experiential travel in the region is promising. According to the WTTC, the region’s overall tourism sector is projected to become a US$222.8 billion industry by 2027, nearly double what it was just a couple of years ago. 
 In particular, investors have recognized Indonesia’s massive potential in the travel tech space, and in 2019, startups in the country accounted for a whopping 70% of travel tech investments in Southeast Asia, according to a  2020 report  by Vynn Capital. 
 The horizontal proliferation of travel tech startups, each offering niche experiences and services, gives millennial travelers a wide range of options. The whole sector is seeing a drive to add new elements to the experience while finding new ways to capture customers from end to end. 
 As the hunger for experiences increases globally, the reverberations from hyperlocal tours will not just generate additional tourist expenditure but also distribute it more widely to rural and lesser-known towns and cities. 
 This trend for millennials may have set off a slew of experiential travel platforms, but it also opens up other possibilities: new airline routes, rural homestay offerings, and the support for local cultures and communities. 
 If tech investors thought there were no more big online travel opportunities left in Southeast Asia, they should think again.

 The Japanese conglomerate promised last year a US$9.5 billion bailout program for WeWork, which includes US$1.5 billion from SoftBank, US$5 billion in debt financing, and the US$3 billion tender offer. 
 According to the report, WeWork shareholders received a letter on Tuesday saying that SoftBank might not repurchase shares from existing investors due to regulatory probes from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. The notice also said that there was a delay in recapitalizing WeWork’s joint venture in China. 
 Regulators have so far  asked  SoftBank for information about WeWork’s business practices and communications to investors. 
 The move, however, would not affect the US$5 billion debt financing, according to the report. 
 As part of the tender program, Adam Neumann, WeWork’s founder who stepped down as the company’s CEO last year, could sell US$970 million of his stock to SoftBank. After the deal closes, SoftBank is expected to own  80%  of WeWork. The tender offer closes April 1. 
 The deal to buy back shares is reportedly not cancelled, but could signify a renegotiation of terms in light of the global economic slowdown brought by the Covid-19 outbreak. ",Doris Yu,1,2,"[(0, 0.1697277), (2, 0.82966584)]","['WeWork', 'SoftBank']","['US', 'China']"

 According to the filings accessed by research firm Tofler, the company has allotted a total of 15,325 series F compulsorily convertible cumulative preference shares at US$52,643.22 apiece. 
 SoftBank’s SVF India poured in roughly US$507 million, while RA Hospitality, the investment entity controlled by Oyo founder and CEO Ritesh Agarwal, has put in US$300 million. 
 As a result, SVF India will hold a 50.6% stake in Oyo and RA Holdings will have 25.87%.  Entrackr  estimates that the round values Oyo at US$7.7 billion. 
 An Oyo spokesperson confirmed the investment to  Tech in Asia , saying that the company will use the additional funds to achieve its 2020 objectives, which include “accretive and sustainable growth, operational excellence, and investment in corporate governance and training.” 
 In October last year, Oyo said it would be raising  US$1.5 billion  in its series F round to strengthen its businesses in the US and Europe. Of that figure, Agarwal himself will be investing US$700 million through RA Hospitality, while existing investors will supplement the remaining amount. 
 The latest development follows a series of layoffs across Oyo’s offices in an effort to boost profitability and slow down spending. 
  Bloomberg  recently reported that Oyo intends to cut about  5,000 to 25,000 jobs  in China, the US, and India. “By the time our restructuring process is complete, Oyo will have over 25,000 employees worldwide,” Agarwal said.

 Pokkt offers an in-app ad platform that includes video ads and app performance marketing. It uses machine learning to help its over 200 advertising partners better target their audiences. 
 AnyMind will integrate Pokkt’s mobile-centric tech stack into its AdAsia Digital platform, which currently helps marketers activate, manage, and track media buys across desktop and mobile channels. 
 The move also extends AnyMind’s global reach, integrating Pokkt’s three offices in India and one office in the UAE. This brings the group’s total geographical span to 17 offices in 13 markets, according to a statement. 
 As part of the deal, Pokkt’s co-founder and CEO, Rohit Sharma, was appointed to serve as the chief operating officer of AnyMind. Sharma replaces Otohiko Kozutsumi, who will now take on the role of chief commercial officer. 
 Vaibhav Odhekar, the chief operating officer of Pokkt, was named AnyMind’s managing director for India and the Middle East. 
 Formerly known as AdAsia, AnyMind started out in 2016 as an AI-driven digital advertising platform. It has since grown to apply its tech to other areas such as entertainment, marketing, and human resources. 
 AnyMind has made five acquisitions to date. It  scooped up  influencer network  Grove  in January, marking its fourth acquisition globally and its  second in Japan after FourM . It had previously bought up  Moindy in Thailand  and Acqua Media in Hong Kong.

642451,"Jack Ma Foundation publishes handbook, shares China’s experience in battling Covid-19","  Alibaba Group  founder Jack Ma’s  namesake philanthropic foundation  collaborated with a hospital in China to publish  an informational handbook  about the hard-won lessons from its experience in treating patients with Covid-19, the viral disease that has been  declared as a pandemic  by the World Health Organization.

 Available in multiple languages, the publication was co-authored by several dozens of medical experts who served at the frontlines of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The goal is to share their best practices in fighting the novel coronavirus with the international medical community. So far, the hospital has reported zero misdiagnoses and deaths despite treating 78 critically ill patients. 
 “Today, with the spread of the global pandemic, these experiences are precious and the most-important weapon for medical personnel,” wrote Ma in a foreword in the handbook. “We hope that, with this handbook, doctors and nurses in other affected areas can learn from experience as they face this battle, without having to start from scratch.” 
 Ongoing efforts 
 The handbook is the latest move by the Jack Ma Foundation to help curb the spread of Covid-19. At time of publishing, it has affected  over 165 countries and killed over 7,900 people worldwide . 
 Since earlier this month, the Jack Ma Foundation and the Alibaba Foundation have collectively donated over 1.7 million testing kits, 12 million surgical masks, and 60,000 protective medical suits to countries that have been hit hard by the virus, including Spain, Italy, South Korea, and Japan. 
 A shipment of 500,000 testing kits is expected to arrive in the US this week. The Jack Ma Foundation is also teaming up with the government of Ethiopia to distribute testing kits and urgently needed medical supplies to  all 54 countries in Africa .

 The Jack Ma Foundation is also working from various angles to stamp out Covid-19. Last month, it donated  US$2.15 million to the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity  in Australia and  US$2.1 million to New York City-based Columbia University  to support the research and development of a vaccine as well as treatments for the disease. 
 “The crisis presents a huge challenge to all humankind in a globalized world. The pandemic we face today can no longer be resolved by any individual country. Rather, we need to combat the virus by working hand-in-hand,” said Ma  in a statement posted on Twitter . “At this moment, we can’t beat this virus unless we eliminate boundaries to resources and share our know-how and hard-earned lessons.” 
 Cultivating a culture of philanthropy 
 Ma is no stranger to dealing with calamities like the current pandemic. 
 In 2003, he had to lead Alibaba – a fledgling business at the time – through the SARS outbreak. It emerged from the crisis stronger and more rooted in its mission and values, said close observers of the company. 
 “While most of us would have panicked, Jack stayed calm and rallied us to stick together to keep the company running,” Porter Erisman, who was then a vice president at Alibaba,  told  Tech in Asia  . “He pointed out that it was important not only for Alibaba’s survival but also for the survival of all of the small and medium-sized businesses that depended on Alibaba.”

 Recognizing that SMEs are a crucial aspect of China’s economy, Alibaba took a similar approach this time around and moved swiftly to launch measures to alleviate the financial pains of merchants operating on its online marketplaces. 
 Its logistics arm Cainiao  established the “Green Channel,”  a data-driven solution to expedite the entire supply chain. From customs clearance to last-mile delivery, the logistics channel ensures that critical supplies and daily necessities reach those in need. 
 Alibaba’s Taobao, China’s largest online marketplace, also  rolled out relief programs  to help local farmers sell their fresh produce at a time when a big portion of the country’s population wasn’t able to go to the wet markets or supermarkets. By leveraging Alibaba’s own online livestreaming tools, Chinese farmers avoided having a wasted surplus, and customers could receive fresh food without breaking the quarantine. 
 Ma  retired as Alibaba’s executive chairman last year  to focus on his philanthropic endeavors, which include improving rural education and public health. But the culture of philanthropy he encouraged at the company has remained. 
 Just two days after the city of Wuhan was quarantined, Alibaba  set aside a fund of 1 billion yuan (US$142.8 million)  for medical supplies to be bought and sent to China’s most affected regions. 
 The company also moved quickly with its aid overseas. Donations to Europe have been routed through Liege, Belgium, where Alibaba is setting up a  logistics hub for the continent . Belgium is also a key part of Ma’s efforts to create an Electronic World Trade Platform (eWTP), agreeing in 2018 to set up a digital free-trade hub.

642244,"Private exchanges could be the cheaper, faster alternative to an IPO"," Imagine this: You are an early employee of a startup like Grab or Traveloka who joined the company with a stock options plan. Years later, the startup has entered decacorn territory, now worth over US$10 billion. But until the company lists on a public stock exchange or gets acquired, there are limited avenues for you to cash out. 
 As companies choose to stay private for longer, the wait time for founders, former and current executives, early institutional investors to get returns on their investments have also increased.

 An initial public offering (IPO) opens up a much-needed liquidity channel for both existing investors as well as new ones, but it’s a costly and time-consuming endeavor. At the same time, the abundance of venture capital and private equity funds are delaying the need for companies to list in order to obtain growth capital. 
 Private exchanges, which allow the trading of securities for non-listed companies, helps investors and other stakeholders to realize paper gains ahead of potential IPOs. 
 It’s a relatively new phenomenon in Asia but has been around in the US since 2003, when the Nasdaq set up its own private secondary exchange with the aim of providing liquidity and financing to companies at earlier stages of their life cycles. Since then, the Nasdaq  Private Market  has provided secondary liquidity worth over US$23 billion for over 33,000 stakeholders. 
 Closer to home, we’re seeing a similar trend.  1Exchange , Singapore’s first regulated private securities exchange, launched in 2018 and counts the Singapore Exchange (SGX) as a strategic investor and shareholder. 
 “We wanted to create a private exchange which would allow private growth companies to remain private yet enjoy the benefits of listing, which is liquidity and global investment outreach,” 1Exchange CEO Choo Haiping tells  Tech in Asia . For SGX, which attracted 11 out of the 126 IPOs in Southeast Asia last year, it was a tactical choice. 
   
 Avoiding a ‘painful’ IPO process 
 Becoming a public-listed company has long been regarded as the pinnacle of a business’ growth journey. For many entrepreneurs, it’s validation of years of hard work. 
 But the premium that these firms are placing on a public listing is changing as other viable sources of funding sprout up. 
 “When you do an IPO, you have to create a prospectus, hire investment bankers, lawyers, auditors, and so forth,” says 1Exchange’s Choo. “You could raise US$5 million to US$10 million, but your fees could range from US$1 million to US$2 million.” For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or growth startups, this is a huge portion of their fundraise – roughly 10% to 20% – he says.

 Private equity is increasingly attractive as an asset class. Over four-fifths of family offices invest in private equity, and on average, 19% of their portfolios are allocated to the asset class, according to a  UBS report . Last year, private markets fared the best of all asset classes for family offices globally, with Asia Pacific’s performance of 19% outstripping the global average of 16%, according to the report. 
 As investors become more sophisticated, they are increasingly inclined to invest in companies through direct approaches, which can save them up to 2% on platform management fees a year, Daniel Lin, CEO of crowdfunding platform  FundedHere  tells  Tech in Asia . 
 One of FundedHere’s products targets small listed companies (valued between S$20 million to S$50 million) on  SGX’s Catalist board  – the exchange’s second board. Lin says FundedHere can help companies raise sums of S$1.5 million to S$3 million (US$1 to US$2.1 million) within 30 days. The platform syndicates accredited investors and facilitates their subscription to plain vanilla private bonds. 
 Alternative investment platforms 
  Fundnel , a private investment platform based in Singapore, is one of the three founding members of an upcoming private exchange –  Hg Exchange . Currently pending regulatory approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the entity is expected to launch later this year. 
 Terms of the exchange, such as its listing requirements, will be jointly determined with its two other founding companies, stock brokerage and financial advisory firm PhilipCapital and investment management firm Prime Partners. 
 Hg Exchange is a member-only platform – a model that will optimize the liquidity and quality of its listings, says Benjamin Twoon, Fundnel’s chief operating officer.

 “It’s member-owned, member-driven,” Twoon says. “If you were a corporate finance firm looking to list one of your clients, you would gravitate toward bringing companies [to list] on this exchange because you own a stake.” 
 Being a blockchain-driven platform, Hg Exchange also touts time and cost efficiencies. “Everytime there is a listing, a set of tokens will be issued, which will represent correspondingly to an equity ownership,” Twoon explains. With a digital custodian, trades would not need to go through a central depository for clearing and settlement, reducing overall fees. 
 Fundnel’s own platform offers unlisted securities in growth and pre-IPO stage firms as well as secondary shares. The firm offers a mix of hybrid products, ranging from pseudo debt-equity products, convertible bonds, mezzanine-type financing, to equity funding solutions for SMEs. 
 The company has facilitated two secondary transactions for Grab so far, and says it’s seeing high investor demand for secondary shares in the ride-hailing company, Ant Financial, ByteDance and Impossible Foods. It completed US$20 million in secondary deals last year. Alternative foods and green technology segments as well as companies that are already making a profit are also leading in terms of investor interest, according to Fundnel. 
 Its big-data-driven software accelerates the fundraising process to two months by automating the due diligence process. In contrast, the traditional IPO process can take up to 12 months and is “more data than tech,” says Twoon, who has a background in corporate finance. 
 Upon completion, Fundnel charges its clients an average “success” fee of 2% of the amount raised, a fraction of the 10% to 20% in fees an IPO would entail. 
 Since its inception in 2015, Fundnel has completed 41 transactions, with the total value of deals launched exceeding US$1 billion. Companies who have successfully raised capital via the platform include Vickers Venture Partners, Dymon Asia Ventures, and SpaceX.

 While Singapore ranked fifth globally as an IPO destination among foreign companies last year and is a popular listing choice for real estate investment trusts (REITs), SGX has long struggled to attract tech listings. In 2017, homegrown companies Razer and Sea listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange, respectively. 
 “There’s a strong correlation between size and liquidity, and it has to do with the number of shareholders,” FundedHere’s Lin says. A general difficulty for many listed companies below a valuation of S$100 million is that they either “don’t have many shareholders to begin with or controlling shareholders own a significant amount of shares – ranging from 30% to 70%,” he explains. 
 1Exchange’s first and only private listing to date, Aggregate Asset Management,  went live  in July 2019, with S$5.6 million (US$4 million) worth of tradable equities. 
 “In the first three months of [Aggregate’s] trading, about S$400,000 to S$500,000 (US$283,000 to US$354,000) was traded,” Choo notes, adding that it has done “pretty well.” A second listing is expected to close by next quarter, subject to macroeconomic conditions.

 For SGX, despite perceptions of low liquidity at the exchange, its global head of equity capital markets, Mohamed Nasser Ismail contends that it has “sufficient liquidity” in areas where there is investor interest. 
 “There are sectors that are showing good growth – areas like REITs, healthcare sector, certain consumer verticals, tech – they are doing well and garnering investor interest,” Ismail tells  Tech in Asia . 
 One example is precision engineering company  Grand Ventures Technology , which listed on the SGX’s Catalist board in January 2019. “It came in at a valuation of 13x PE (price-to-equity ratio). Today, it is trading at 20x PE,” he adds. 
 SGX’s stake in 1Exchange was no accident. “Having a platform like 1Exchange positions SGX, as well as Singapore, as a go-to capital market in the region,” Ismail says. 
 While the hope is to improve the chances of companies performing well once they transition from the private to public market, SGX says it does not mandate that companies on 1Exchange eventually list on SGX. 
 “We see the platforms as being complementary and serving different needs for different periods of growth for every company,” Ismail says. “It enables us to work with companies to prepare them to meet the rigor of the public market. That process is important to improve the chances of companies performing well once they transition from private to public market.” 
 He adds that as companies mature, they will inevitably need to enter the public domain. “A listing is not only about [raising] money, it’s also about achieving a level of transparency, access to retail investors, governance, risk management, internal control, running an organization in a sustainable way, and growing it in a responsible and transparent manner,” Ismail notes.

642135,3 tips for doing business in the Chinese and Hong Kong markets," What makes for an ideal place to establish a company? 
 Beyond offering a strategic advantage and world-class infrastructure and systems, leading business hubs boast high numbers of financial institutions, favorable government policies, and abundant growth opportunities. 
 That’s true for both Hong Kong and China, which is why they’re known as  Asia’s financial center  and  the world’s largest trading nation , respectively. 
 In 2019, Hong Kong was home to  3,184  startups, and its stock market remains a world leader, with  market capitalization numbers in 2018 up six times compared to 2000 . 
 China is no slouch either, having  the most number of unicorns the world  in 2019 and ranking highly across several key indicators, including being  the world’s second-largest economy , behind only the US. 
 The social, political, and economic stability in China over the last three decades has been instrumental to this. The government has forged a supportive business environment, crafting policies that support entrepreneurs both local and foreign. There are also ample business opportunities in both urban and rural areas of the country, and foreign investors can easily connect with local business partners.

 Across the border in Hong Kong,  it only takes a week to set up a company . According to the World Bank, the city has  the most business-friendly tax system in the globe , and it has been named  the world’s freest economy  for the 25th year in a row. Having no capital controls also makes funding and switching easy for potential business owners in Hong Kong. Additionally, the market has  a booming digital banking scene . 
 Navigating business challenges 
 Despite these plus factors, however, starting a company in these markets is not without its share of challenges. 
 For instance, Hong Kong and China have regulations that could affect a company’s finances. And while both places have world-class infrastructures, logistical problems such as remittance issues may still occur. Doing business in these markets may also be especially difficult for an entrepreneur who only speaks one language. 
 Cross-border payments hub  Tranglo  experienced these advantages and challenges first hand when it entered both markets. The Malaysia-based company aims to make  international business payments  easier for business owners and startups. 
 Tranglo has inked partnerships with fellow fintech players  WeChat Pay Hong Kong  and China’s  Alipay  so it can help clients expand their reach at low cost.

 For those looking to set up offices in Hong Kong and China, here are tips from Tranglo on how to successfully navigate these territories. 
 1. Hire people who know the markets well 
 China and Hong Kong have financial regulations that may drive up business expenses. For example, differences in trading currencies may mean that companies could incur additional foreign exchange exposure and be subjected to unpredictable global market movements. To make things more complicated, China also has strict restrictions on overseas media and information. 
 With these in mind, it’s crucial to have people on your team who are knowledgeable about local laws and customs as well as savvy with using the popular social media and communication applications in these places. 
 That’s why before Tranglo expanded to these markets, the company put together special project teams composed of legal, marketing, and product experts who have worked at or done business with Chinese and Hong Kong firms. 
 These teams got the ball rolling for the company. Their experience helped with networking at fintech conferences and exhibitions, where Tranglo CEO Jacky Lee first met representatives from WeChat Pay Hong Kong and Alipay. 
 Following the initial introductions, Lee took to WeChat to connect with WeChat Pay personnel, and ultimately a partnership between the two firms was born. 
 2. Overcome the language barrier 
 When working with partners from China and Hong Kong, entrepreneurs must speak as the locals do. Fluency in Mandarin is obligatory in China, but in Hong Kong it’s often better to hold business discussions in Cantonese or English. 
 “Conducting business discussions in the local languages will ensure points come across as intended and are not misunderstood,” says Tranglo’s Lee. 
 Team members who were fluent in either Mandarin or Cantonese were appointed to liaise with Alipay or WeChat Pay Hong Kong, respectively. To avoid misunderstandings, backups also sat in for every conference call.

 3. Have business flexibility and transparency 
 From contract negotiations to data sharing, flexibility is crucial in these markets. There are instances when potential partners may request for sensitive business information before finalizing an agreement. In such cases, businesses have to strike a balance between flexibility and transparency. 
 To secure a tie-up, Tranglo and its partners had to conduct plenty of negotiations on contracts, compliance, and marketing issues. Flexibility was vital especially during commercial discussions, where promotion strategies had to be aligned and Tranglo had to ensure that the needs of partners in targeted markets were met. 
 Making payment across borders easier 
 Its global expertise and familiarity with the Chinese and Hong Kong markets enabled Tranglo to secure partnerships. These collaborations were a boon to the startup’s overarching mission to consolidate the fragmented payment ecosystem and to streamline the remittance process. 
 “Within the Tranglo ecosystem, we integrate everything,” says Lee. “A business aiming to expand globally only needs to establish a partnership with us.”

 The round was led by LGT Lightstone Aspada and included participation from existing investors Unicorn India Ventures and Accion Venture Lab, according to a statement.

 Smartcoin runs a credit-underwriting algorithm that puts together a number of data points to build the risk profile of a prospective borrower and offer loan products that match. 
 The startup’s co-founder and CEO, Rohit Garg, said that the company’s goal has been to support India’s “credit-starved” lower- and middle-income segments. “Deeper insights into the customer’s financial and behavioral data, combined with a gamified ladder, enables unlocking better products over time,” he added. 
 The company plans to use the new funds to grow its loan book, expand its data science team, and grow its user base. Smartcoin also looks to use part of the funds to strengthen its AI and machine learning-based underwriting platform and launch new offerings. 
 The microlender began operations three years ago, offering loans to those who mainly borrow to fund their economic advancement. Since then, the startup said it has scaled up to serve about half a million customers across all the states and over 95% districts of India. 
 In 2017, the company raised an undisclosed amount of investment led by Unicorn India Ventures. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.10329417), (1, 0.89619255)]",[],"['India', 'Smartcoin']"
642424,Pinduoduo enters workplace collaboration market with Knock app," 
 Chinese social ecommerce company  Pinduoduo  has unveiled an enterprise communication app called Knock on Monday, stepping into the booming workplace collaboration market, local media outlet  Caijingtuya  reported.

 Knock provides basic functions including instant messages, to-do lists, contacts management, voice call, and audio conferencing. However, it lacks other popular features such as video conferencing, file transfer, and task approval. 
 Knock is currently available on iOS and Android stores, and users can register on the app with a phone number either as an individual user or as a member of an organization. Individual users have to create or join an organization before they can have full access to all of Knock’s features. 
 The first version of Knock was launched on January 26 this year for internal testing. However, the app has been used for Pinduoduo’s internal communication since the fourth quarter of 2019, a Pinduoduo employee told  Caijingtuya . 
 Since the end of the Chinese New Year holiday, more than 18 million companies have asked their employees to work from home due to the coronavirus outbreak. The number of telecommuters in China has exceeded 300 million, according to market research firm iiMedia. 
 Pinduoduo is a latecomer in the enterprise collaboration service market, as major players in China’s internet economy take steps to enhance their platforms due to the rising demand. 
 Alibaba’s DingTalk, Tencent’s WeChat Work, Huawei’s WeLink, and ByteDance’s Lark have all opened their remote working services to the public free of charge from late January. Baidu has also introduced Baidu Hi to the public on February 12, 2020, while Sohu launched a beta version of a new office app called Little E during the same month.

642068,"Shopee dominates mobile, but others have ‘ample room’ to catch up: report","  Shopee  has surpassed Alibaba-backed  Lazada  as the most used ecommerce app in Southeast Asia in the second half of 2019, latest data from iPrice, App Annie, and SimilarWeb show. 
 
  Photo credit: Shopee 
 
 The  Map of Ecommerce report for Q4 2019  shows that Shopee raked in the most number of monthly active users and downloads, overtaking Lazada. In terms of web visits, Shopee also takes the top spot with over 2 billion visits, followed by Lazada with around 1.8 billion visits. 
 According to iPrice, Shopee has been performing well across the region since Q1 2019, ranking first in mobile usage since the third quarter. “Shopee’s prominence in the top position is mainly spurred by its backing from a large company like Tencent,” the price comparison site told  Tech in Asia . 
 Various user acquisition and brand awareness initiatives, including recent marketing campaigns that involved prominent brand ambassadors and product diversification, has led to this growth, iPrice said. 
 
 
 
 
 Last year, the ecommerce site introduced a livestreaming feature, Shopee Live, on its app and had football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo in its promotional activities. It also held the 12.12 Shopee Super Show in Vietnam. 
 But while Shopee ranked first in mobile usage in Indonesia and Vietnam, Lazada remained dominant in the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia, according to the report. 
 Shopee has not yet turned a profit. Its parent firm, Sea, reported a net loss of over  US$1.4 billion  for 2019, in which cost of service for its ecommerce unit and other related services accounted for most of the loss. Alibaba, on the other hand, reported around US$1 billion in revenue for its international commerce retail business, accounting for only 5% of Alibaba’s total revenue of US$23.2 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. 
 Despite Shopee’s success in mobile usage, “there is still ample room for other ecommerce platforms such as Tokopedia, Bukalapak, and others to catch up to the top spot,” iPrice said. 
 In terms of most used ecommerce apps in the region, Indonesian ecommerce firms Tokopedia and Bukalapak followed in third and fourth places, respectively. 
 Citing data from the Indonesian Internet Providers Association, iPrice said that about 56% of internet users in the country never made ecommerce transactions and that about 53% of them have never visited any ecommerce platform. This, along with the government’s plan to ramp up internet usage in the country, is advantageous for local ecommerce firms “as they pride themselves as a homegrown company that highly localizes their business for Indonesians.” 
 
 
 
 
 The archipelago is also expected to generate  US$82 billion  in online retail sales by 2025 and account for over 50% of the region’s ecommerce market due to increasing internet access, according to Statista. 
 The Map of Ecommerce report also highlighted three up-and-comers in the region. Vietnam’s  Sendo  has been the fifth most downloaded ecommerce app for two consecutive quarters, while US-based  Wish  rose from the ranks in the second half of 2019 to become the fourth most downloaded app in Southeast Asia.  Singapore-based Zilingo , meanwhile, was one of the few fashion e-tailers to make it to the top 10.

 The fund, backed by BNB, BUSD, and WRX digital assets, will invest US$100,000 to US$5 million in both equity and tokens, according to a statement. 
 It looks to incubate blockchain projects and startups focused on solving industrial and social problems. The investments may include fiat-to-digital asset gateway solutions, trading platforms, payment and remittance solutions, digital asset wallets, stablecoins, decentralized financing platforms, and decentralized applications, among others. 
 Binance and WazirX will also partner with venture funds that are actively investing and supporting India’s blockchain space. 
 Additionally, the initiative will look to provide mentorship and support to universities and student organizations interested in setting up university blockchain technology incubators. Selected startup founders and teams will get direct access to Binance’s ecosystem of products and initiatives. 
 “We have more new initiatives in our pipeline that we will be coming out within the next few months to help build the Indian blockchain ecosystem from a broader scope, including project funding, technology and talent development,” said Changpeng Zhao, CEO and founder of Binance. 
 The team is now looking for talent with venture capital and blockchain research backgrounds to join the fund. It’s also searching for industry leaders, executives for business development and government relations, as well as advisors for its advisory committee.

 Grab Ventures Ignite Vietnam is a 14-week scale-up program  dedicated to early-stage startups in the country . With its partnership with IMDA, Grab is opening up the accelerator to Singapore-based startups looking to expand into the Vietnamese market. 
 Two companies from the city-state will be selected for the full Ignite program, according to a statement. They will be able to benefit from Grab’s cross-border expansion support to accelerate their entry into Vietnam. 
 The Singapore pilot is also set to give three other startups the opportunity to join a three-day bootcamp hosted by Grab, IMDA’s innovation space Pixel, and Digital Industry Singapore. 
 The five selected firms will be eligible to receive cloud credits of up to US$100,000 each, access to facilities at Pixel, as well as consultation and mentorship services. 
 According to the statement, Grab and IMDA will evaluate startups according to core team strength, current standing in the Singapore market, potential fit with the Vietnamese market, and readiness to expand, among others. 
 Startups interested in joining the Singapore leg of Ignite can apply by April 10 this year, Grab said. 
 Ignite was launched last month as an extension of the ongoing Grab Ventures Velocity accelerator focused on post-seed startups. Grab particularly encouraged startups from sectors such as mobility, food, payments, financial services, logistics, ecommerce, and AI to apply for the program.

642303,Gojek raises US$1.2b to take on Grab," Indonesian super app Gojek has closed US$1.2 billion in new funding, the company said in an internal memo. 
 The money in this tranche is all new and does not include money from previous announcements, a person familiar with Gojek says. 
 This long-awaited update follows the company’s  US$1 billion  raise in the first close of its series F round last year. Google, JD.com, and Tencent were involved in the first close, which was said to value the company at US$9.5 billion.

 From 2019 onward, the company has secured close to US$3 billion, which exceeded its US$2.5 billion target, it revealed in the internal memo. 
 Gojek has raised over US$5 billion since its inception. Its rival Grab, meanwhile, has hauled in nearly US$10 billion, although those resources are being deployed across Southeast Asia. 
 Gojek declined to comment for this story. An email announcing the news was sent out today to GoTroops – the moniker for Gojek employees. 
 Despite the new funding, the company is closely monitoring its spending. 
 “We have always been good at doing more with less and this ability is going to be more important than ever over the coming months,” the company said in the memo. 
 “As the economic slowdown takes hold, the availability of that investment will be reduced, so we should focus every dollar where we think it will make the most impact and not take our resources for granted.” 
 The fundraising comes amid merger talks between Grab and Gojek that have intensified this year, according to  The Information . Any potential merger, however, will likely see pushback from authorities. ",Terence Lee,0,2,"[(3, 0.99941164)]","['Gojek', 'GoTroops', 'Google']",[]
642207,Gojek mafia makes waves across Indonesian startup scene," In Silicon Valley, the term  “PayPal Mafia”  was popularized by  Fortune  magazine in 2007. It refers to the payments company’s alumni who have gone on to start, lead, or back other tech companies. The pack consists of prominent names including Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman.

 As the Indonesian startup ecosystem matures, it appears that the country has produced its own tech mafia, featuring some of the former top execs at the country’s biggest startup,  Gojek . 
 Nadiem Makarim, who founded the ride-hailing giant, was appointed last year to  become the education minister of Indonesia . Meanwhile, other former Gojek executives have either built their own companies or assumed executive roles at other local startups. 
 The increasing digital economic opportunities in Indonesia, the biggest digital market in Southeast Asia, is whetting the appetite of the Gojek mafia. The country’s internet-based economy’s gross merchandise value (GMV) is expected to reach US$133 billion in 2025 from US$40 billion last year, according to  estimates by Google, Temasek, and Bain . Goldman Sachs forecasts an even brighter future: US$228 billion GMV by 2025. 
 Here are the 10 members of the Gojek mafia. Four of them came from GoLife, Gojek’s lifestyle app which  discontinued most services  last year due to stagnant growth.

642243,Baidu sets up medical subsidiary Baidu Health amid Covid-19 crisis," China’s largest search engine,  Baidu , launched a subsidiary called Baidu Health on March 12, online news portal  Sina  reported, citing corporate registration information detected by intelligence provider Tianyancha.

 Baidu Health, with a registered capital of 30 million yuan (US$4.3 million), has a business scope of software, cosmetics, sanitizing materials, medical gear, and more. 
 Baidu declined to comment when contacted by  KrAsia  on Monday. 
 Baidu is one of many Chinese tech giants leveraging its capabilities to help the country contain the Covid-19 outbreak. With its telecommunication technologies, Huawei has powered a remote diagnosis platform in a new makeshift hospital in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. JD.com has used its Level 4 autonomous driving vehicles to deliver medical supplies to a hospital in Wuhan. 
 After the outbreak, Baidu launched a free medical consultation platform on its app to provide online access to doctors and answers to pneumonia-related questions. 
 By leveraging Baidu’s open-source deep learning platform PaddlePaddle and Baidu’s semantic segmentation toolkit PaddleSeg, Beijing-based data analysis company LinkingMed developed an AI-powered pneumonia screening and lesion detection system. The system, which has been put into use in a hospital in Hunan province, can pinpoint the disease in less than one minute with a detection accuracy of 92%. 
 Before establishing this subsidiary, Baidu applied to the authorities to include selling medical instruments into its business scope, and the company sought to donate eye-scanning machines to 500 impoverished counties across China,  KrAsia  reported in February 2019.

 After the deal closes, AMTD Digital is expected to have a 51% stake in PolicyPal – a mix of cash and equity – subject to MAS’ approval, Yap said. Yap will continue to lead PolicyPal as CEO. 
 The startup will also become a member company under AMTD Digital, acting as its operating vehicle to develop and expand in the Southeast Asian insurtech sector, the announcement said. PolicyPal will also collaborate with AMTD’s insurance brokerage company, AMTD Risk Solution, to promote online insurance services and risk management experience. 
 Launched in 2016, PolicyPal helps consumers to understand their insurance needs and provides them with financial planning solutions. It’s supported by 500 Startups, PayPal, and angel investor Koh Boon Hwee. With the acquisition, PolicyPal looks to ride on AMTD’s operating licenses in Hong Kong to expand into North Asia, Yap said. 
 AMTD Digital, meanwhile, has been working towards building a one-stop, cross-market digital financial services platform for Asian consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises. It wants to integrate digital banking, digital insurance, digital asset exchange, e-payment or remittance, and other licensed businesses in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, according to the statement. 
 Last year, AMTD Group, together with Chinese electronics company Xiaomi, established Airstar Bank and obtained a virtual banking license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. It has also teamed up with SP Group, Xiaomi, and Funding Societies to jointly apply for the Singapore  digital wholesale banking license . 
 AMTD Group said Singapore, which serves as the company’s regional headquarters, is an important hub for Southeast Asia’s fintech space. The deal with PolicyPal marks an important milestone for AMTD as it further invests in the city-state and the region’s fintech industry, the statement said.

642182,Declaring Covid-19 as a pandemic is our best shot at defeating an invisible enemy," Dear readers, 
 I’m glad that the World Health Organization (WHO) finally classified the Covid-19 outbreak a  pandemic . Truth be told, I wanted to use that label a month ago, but my colleague Eileen Ang wisely advised me not to. It was WHO’s call to make, not mine. 
 In my mind, it should have been declared a pandemic as early as mid-February. And it’s not because using it grabs readers’ attention. I knew that people would only take Covid-19 seriously if it were officially considered a problem of epic proportions. WHO’s declaration is having the desired effect – just look at the headlines in the last few days. 
 The US has  suspended flights from Europe for 30 days . Singapore is placing citizens and residents on  14-day home stay  if they traveled across Southeast Asia, Japan, Switzerland and the UK, while  Malaysia  will prohibit its citizens from going abroad and foreigners from entering the country for two weeks starting tomorrow. The Philippines  widened the quarantine  in the national capital region to cover the entire island of Luzon. Following the steps undertaken by hard-hit Italy,  Spain has imposed a nationwide lockdown  as Europe becomes the  “epicenter” of Covid-19  according to WHO.

 Only time will tell whether these government measures will help to eventually curb the pandemic. But the economic fallout from the unabated spread of the coronavirus is more worrying. Just look at how central banks are panicking: The  US Federal Reserve , for example, slashed its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to near zero. That’s the second time that it has reduced rates in less than two weeks. 
 Indeed, the  economic impact of Covid-19  will be bigger and longer-lasting than that of the 2008 global financial crisis, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said via Facebook. Some of the city-state’s biggest corporations are bracing for tougher times, with Singtel  freezing wages  and CapitaLand’s senior management and board members taking a  pay cut . Across Asia, our recent  survey  shows that the businesses of 8 in 10 of startups in the region have been negatively affected by the pandemic. 
 With the level of infections around the world surpassing that of China, the situation will most likely worsen before it gets better. 
   
 It’s hard to fight an invisible enemy, but it will be harder to win this battle if we don’t have the right data. To ensure that Asia’s tech and startup community have the information they need to make critical decisions, we’ve unlocked some of our subscriber-only articles about Covid-19 and its impact on business:

 * Travel slumps, ecommerce thrives as Wuhan coronavirus spreads  
 We need to stay healthy and vigilant during these times. Being careful doesn’t mean we’re paralyzed by the fear of getting infected by this dreaded disease. Life must go on. 
 Once we’ve put  precautions in place, we have to do our best to maintain a “business as usual” stance. That is the only way we can mitigate the economic malaise that will result from this pandemic. To this end,  Tech in Asia  is proceeding with this year’s  Product Development Conference  by hosting it online, making it our  first-ever virtual summit .

 Starting tomorrow, Deliveroo customers will be able to choose contact-free delivery at check out from the company’s app or website. Riders will be able to see when a customer has selected this option in the order’s delivery notes and then follow a process to ensure there is no contact when the food is delivered, the company’s announcement said. 
 Deliveroo said riders will place the thermal bag open on the ground outside the customer’s door, step back at least one meter, and wait for the customer to collect the food before the order can be completed. 
 Likewise, riders may opt for contactless orders or request to cancel an order without penalty if they feel an area is at high risk. 
 Launched in 2013, the London-based platform operates in over 500 towns and cities across 13 markets, including Australia, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, the UAE, Kuwait, and the UK. 
 Other players in the space have also launched contactless delivery services to cope with the Covid-19 outbreak. Earlier this year, China’s Meituan Dianping enabled its users to have their food delivered without having to interact with the courier. 
 Swiggy and Zomato, two foodtech unicorns based in India, have started allowing consumers to ask delivery partners to leave their orders at their doorstep as well. 
 Regional ride-hailing giant Grab has also implemented contactless delivery in Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Aside from dropping off orders outside its customers’ doors or at specific locations, the company is also encouraging its users to use cashless payment to minimize contact between its partners and consumers.

642079,Tech in Asia’s Product Development Conference is moving online!,"   
 Hi TIA community, 
 Here at  Tech in Asia , we are tracking, discussing, and reporting on the ups and downs of 2020. In addition to keeping tabs on the business impact of  Covid-19 on our region , we are also deeply concerned about the health and safety of our community. 
 Thus, we are excited to announce that this year’s Product Development Conference (PDC) will be hosted online, making it  Tech in Asia’s   first-ever virtual summit . 
 Even though we’ve made this decision for health reasons, in truth, this is a move that we have long considered. Now, anyone with an internet connection can join the  Tech in Asia  community, without worrying about travel logistics and timing as well as the costs of flights and accommodations. 
 We know that moving events online is a challenge. We may lose some defining characteristics of our conferences, such as the great in-person connections or the energy of a packed auditorium. We’re working tirelessly to see how we can bring these aspects alive digitally. 
 Ultimately, we view this as an opportunity to reinvent our own events business  and grow Asia’s online tech community. Building community has always been a core tenet of our mission. If taking our events online means better access and more resources for Asia’s tech community, then we eagerly arise to the challenge.   
 As we go online, expect to see innovation in our content and format to better deliver insights. We’re also planning to engage global speakers, increase networking connections, and lower ticket prices. 
 For starters, our PDC will now feature a two-geographic series hosted over two weeks so we can properly dive into market-specific insights: 
 
 July 1 to 2 (Tuesday and Wednesday): Building and scaling great products in Indonesia 
 July 8 to 9 (Tuesday and Wednesday): Developing and growing great products across Asia 
 
 Each one will feature interactive sessions with product leaders, opportunities for online networking, and exciting formats to learn and share alongside Asia’s product community. We have already confirmed top speakers, including Stevanus Christopel, head of design for Ovo, and Monica Rudijono, chief marketing officer for Lazada Indonesia. 
 For our partners and sponsors, we want to deliver the same great connections that we’ve always offered. If you’d like to be a sponsor for Asia’s first virtual product summit or to host your own virtual event with  Tech in Asia  Studios, please  get in touch . 
 As we monitor the outbreak, we will keep making decisions in the best interest of our community. Stay tuned for an update in early May about our annual  Tech in Asia  Conference, which is currently scheduled for late September. 
 Hope to see you online in July!

642099,Bringing electric motorbikes to Southeast Asia’s masses," Jakarta’s smog grows  thicker  by the year. Sputtering motorbikes clog the city’s congested streets in rising numbers, spewing toxic fumes as they weave in and out of traffic. 
 Indonesia has about  115 million  motorbikes – or almost half its human population. These two-wheelers are affordable and easy to drive, making it the leading mode of transportation in many countries. 
 
  From left: COO and co-founder Joel Chang, CEO and co-founder James Chan / Photo credit: Ion Mobility 
 
 James Chan and Joel Chang, co-founders of Singapore-based  Ion Mobility , are eyeing a big opportunity. If they can bring affordable electric motorbikes to the masses, they won’t just make a ton of money – they can cut down air pollution, improve the health of city dwellers, and mitigate climate change. 
 They’re not the first e-motorbike maker out there, but they’re in the running to create the first mainstream one. 
 It’s a grandiose goal, but Chan wants nothing less. After stints as a government servant, startup investor, and tech executive, he’s aiming for the moon. “I want my three young kids to know that their father is doing something that can make an impact on the world,” he says. 
 Chang was the co-founder of  Scorpio Electric , an e-motorbike outfit also based in the city-state that targets premium customers. He later realized that his beliefs changed – instead of pushing for exclusivity, he thought creating an affordable product should be the way to go. 
 The entrepreneurs met and found that they had the same vision. In October 2019, they took the first step of registering their company. 
 No petrol needed 
 Ion Mobility remains an embryo. It’s refining its prototype – which works and  packs a punch  – in a sparse industrial estate. The startup has lined up a dealer in Indonesia to gear up for a commercial launch in the second half of this year. 
 While the founders toyed with the idea of enticing business users first, they ended up in the consumer market. Businesses hesitate to adopt something without consumers doing it first, Chang reasons. 
 Their first product – dubbed Model 1 – won’t appeal to everyone. Instead, they’re wooing Indonesia’s middle-class millennials, a sizeable and growing group that’s more conscious about climate change compared to older generations. 
 Still, cost savings will be a draw. Compared to the gas-guzzling equivalent, Chan expects their motorbike’s power consumption to cost six to seven times less for every kilometer of travel. This benefit partly stems from how an electric motor doesn’t consume any power when idle, whereas a gasoline engine would keep running. 
 And because their e-motorbike – which can be charged from a wall socket – lacks fuel components like a spark plug and doesn’t need engine oil, maintenance will cost two or three times less, Chan claims.

 The Model 1 is hooked up to the internet. Sensors on the vehicle would collect data about its performance and inform the owner when it’s time to send it in for maintenance. A well-tuned bike, in turn, would consume less energy. Driving behavior data could also help improve future designs. 
 A full charge, which takes three hours, allows two days of commuting to and from the workplace. This means that the bike is not suitable for heavy-duty usage – turning it into an  ojek  Indonesia’s motorcycle taxis – isn’t ideal. But that’s not a segment that Ion Mobility is targeting – for now. 
 They’ll listen to feedback for Model 1 before deciding what the next product should be, Chang says. 
 Not a ride-hailer 
 Ion Mobility is breaking away from how traditional motorbike makers earn income. “We’re not interested in one-off revenues,” he adds, keeping the details under wraps for the time being. 
 “We’re not running a ride-hailing platform,” Chan hints. He notes that incumbents are aligning and sharing margins with financiers, distributors, dealers, and aftersales networks, making it a formidable ecosystem to go up against. 
 And unlike Gogoro, an e-scooter startup from Taiwan (full list of industry players  here ), Ion Mobility doesn’t believe in the battery-swapping model, which lets users replace empty power packs with fresh ones either at home or at a petrol kiosk. 
 Yes, this approach lets users get to 100% power in a jiffy as opposed to waiting three hours. But the cost and effort of maintaining a battery-swapping network, let alone designing and committing to a power pack and the swapping interface, isn’t worth it. 
 “Swapping has not been able to scale,” Chang observes.

 On the other hand, relying on the ubiquitous wall socket allows Ion Mobility to stay lean. The company is finalizing its pre-series A funding round and has only relied on money from its founders so far. 
 While launching a hardware product is expensive, Chan says that the team has reduced the upfront capital needed to go to market through its expertise, experiences, and supply chain relationships. 
 “Without raising a series A, we’ll be able to launch the bike, which I think is unheard of in this region,” he adds. 
 Fending off copycats 
 With the long list of e-motorbike players and how two-wheelers are less complex than four-wheelers, the market may become overcrowded fast. 
 Chan disagrees. “I don’t think any successful product is easy to copy. If I extend the same logic, one could assert that mobile phones are easier to copy than laptops, which is not necessarily true,” he adds. 
 Designing a motorbike also has more constraints when compared to a car due to the lower surface and volume. 
 
  Photo credit: Ion Mobility 
 
 And besides, even if Ion Mobility’s design is copied, it can build a moat out of the operational complexity of running supply chain, revenue, and distribution models that makes sense. A solid brand is hard to replicate too. 
 These factors explain why Tesla has kept the lead despite an onslaught of competition from incumbent car-makers. 
 Preventing deaths 
 The hope is that clean private transportation can lower the world’s carbon footprint. In vehicles that run on fossil fuels, the engine serves as a power generator, converting fuel into electricity. For electric vehicles, power generation starts and ends at the power plant – making the process more efficient due to the economies of scale, Chang says. 
 Indeed,  studies   have   shown  that in their entire life cycle, electric vehicles often emit less greenhouse gases compared to gasoline or diesel counterparts. 
 However, if electric vehicles get their power supply from “dirty” sources like coal, they could add to pollution instead of curbing it. 
 So while electric vehicles are a key part of the equation, their environmental impact will only be maximized when they’re plugged into a clean power grid.

 And yet, if mass adoption of electric bikes leads to less smog on the street level, that counts as a win – vehicle exhausts have been linked to a whole host of  health problems . Air pollution causes 7 million premature deaths each year, the  World Health Organization estimates . 
 “We’re not going to be able to change the world overnight,” Chan says. “Even Elon Musk had to go through a bunch of iterations.” ",Terence Lee,2,6,"[(1, 0.6667316), (2, 0.06837651), (3, 0.26485932)]",[],"['Taiwan', 'Singapore', 'Indonesia', 'Jakarta']"
641686,Q and A with a former Alibaba executive: Every crisis presents opportunities," Dear Readers,

 We reconnected and exchanged a few messages after he read  this commentary . Given that he was with Alibaba during the SARS outbreak in 2003, I thought a Q and A with him would be helpful so he can share his experience with you. 
 I hope you find Porter’s insights useful. We’ve also unlocked our reports on Covid-19 so you can read it for free. If you like our work, please support us  by subscribing . 
 
  How the coronavirus outbreak will make China’s tech titans stronger than ever  
  8 in 10 Asian startups’ businesses hit by coronavirus outbreak: Tech in Asia survey  
  Travel slumps, ecommerce thrives as coronavirus spreads  
  Asian tech deals slow as novel coronavirus epidemic spreads  
 
 Q and A with Porter Erisman 
 
  Jack Ma and Porter Erisman (right) 
 
  
  What I learned from Jack and my colleagues at Alibaba was that the old adage is true – every crisis presents opportunities.
  
  WW:  When did you join Alibaba and what was your role? 
  PE:  I joined Alibaba in April 2000, just as the company was moving out of Jack Ma’s apartment. For the next eight years I served as a vice president in a variety of international roles, ranging from marketing to website operations. 
  WW:  Prior to SARS, could you describe the mood and general plans at Alibaba? 
  PE:  SARS hit China – and Alibaba – in spring of 2003. It came at a time when the company had just reached profitability, and the mood was at an all-time high after a long internet winter that followed the dot-com bust. We were finally growing again and entered 2003 with big, ambitious plans to grow the company even more. But of course, when a colleague of mine was confirmed a SARS case, all those plans changed. 
  WW:  That sucks, and it does  sound familiar . Anyway, you were quarantined for 10 days – what happened? How was your work affected? 
  PE:  In spring of 2003, we attended the Canton Fair, a very important trade show for us at the time. We had invested about US$300,000 for promotional activities at the event, so the team was hesitant to cancel. But because the Canton Fair was held in Guangzhou – the SARS epicenter – it proved risky and, in retrospect, foolish for us to attend. 
 When we got back to Hangzhou, a colleague who had been sitting next to me at the Alibaba booth became a confirmed SARS case and was hospitalized. I and seven others were put into quarantine in our homes. I was locked in my apartment and a guard was placed at the apartment lobby. But the local government was actually very good to me and brought me flowers and food, so I felt safe and cared for. 
 Sensing the risk to the operations, Jack Ma had everyone from the Hangzhou headquarters take computers home and we set up a virtual operation so that we could still run the company. This proved to be an important decision because not long after our first set of quarantines happened, the entire Hangzhou headquarters, which had about 400 employees, was put in quarantine. 
 For the next week or so, the whole company was run virtually, with our Hangzhou colleagues working from home. We had customer service phone calls rerouted to our homes, and all the family members of staff – including grandmas and grandpas – would answer the phone, “Hello, Alibaba” before passing the phone to our Alibaba colleague. It was run so smoothly that the vast majority of our customers around the world had no idea that we were quarantined. 
 
  Screengrab from  Crocodile in the Yangtze – The Alibaba Story  
 
  WW:  How did then-CEO Jack Ma react? And how did he communicate to the team? 
  PE:  SARS could have destroyed the company, but instead, it brought our team much closer together. And I think it was all because of Jack Ma’s reaction. 
 While most of us would have panicked, Jack stayed calm and rallied us to stick together to keep the company running. He pointed out that it was important not only for Alibaba’s survival but also for the survival of all of the small and medium-sized businesses that depended on Alibaba. He used the crisis to bring the company together, and the employees responded incredibly well. 
 While working from home, colleagues held online karaoke contests and got busy in chat groups to keep everyone’s spirits up. 
 Fortunately, after a week our colleague was released from the hospital, and we were released from quarantine. When we arrived back at work, we were a stronger team than before the crisis. 
  WW:  What did you learn from the experience that you’d like other entrepreneurs to know? 
  PE:  What I learned from Jack and my colleagues at Alibaba was that the old adage is true – every crisis presents opportunities. 
 When we entered 2003 we had big plans. When the SARS crisis hit, all of those plans changed. We could have hung our heads and thought about how none of our original plans for the year could be realized. But as Jack Ma likes to say, “Change is the only constant,” and it is important to embrace change. So we were forced to stay calm, face the new reality, and find opportunities where we could. 
 First, we found that SARS was an opportunity to bring the team together to face a common challenge. How we overcame SARS as a team not only served as a source of inspiration at the time, but also added to the company lore. Even today, new Alibaba colleagues are taught about how the team faced the challenge successfully as an example of the importance of staying positive and embracing opportunities in the face of a crisis. Here, Jack Ma’s leadership and communication to the team were key. 
 Second, we realized that SARS was an opportunity to grow ecommerce in China. In 2003, many small businesses were still doing things in traditional, inefficient ways. But when buyers and sellers stopped wanting to meet face to face, it meant that they finally had to adopt ecommerce and the growth trend accelerated. This was further accelerated when we partnered with the government to hold training seminars throughout the country for small businesses to teach them how to do business online. It can be said that 2003 was the year that ecommerce really took off and went mainstream in China. 
 Third, we used the opportunity to launch new business ideas. In fact, the consumer ecommerce boom in China started during the SARS outbreak, which was also when Alibaba’s Taobao site was launched. People may not know that Taobao’s founders were working together, quarantined in Alibaba’s original apartment before we even publicly launched the company. Just think about it: A US$400+ billion business was launched when things seemed most bleak. There can be no doubt that some of the next generation of wildly successful businesses are being developed and launched today – even when it seems like our darkest hour. 
 Finally, the Covid-19 crisis presents other opportunities for us all, beyond business. Maybe it’s time to write that book or screenplay you’ve always dreamed about. Maybe it’s time to slow down a bit and focus on that exercise plan that you’ve been putting off and take up yoga or do push-ups and sit-ups at home. 
 I had my own grand plans for the year that are now on pause, but I see it as a wonderful opportunity to spend time with my 3-year old daughter and 5-month old son. I now have the chance to focus on them and see their changes every day. And I’m sure that some day – after we’ve overcome this challenge – we will look back and fondly recall those times when we slowed down and spent time together as a family. Maybe that’s the best opportunity of all. 
  This Q and A was edited for clarity and brevity.

642051,Indonesian consumer watchdog disapproves of possible Grab-Gojek merger," Indonesia’s consumer watchdog has expressed disapproval should a merger between ride-hailing giants Gojek and Grab arise. 
 Tulus Abadi, the chair of daily management at the Indonesian Consumers Foundation (YLKI), told local media outlet  Bisnis  on Thursday that the merger would enable the resulting company to monopolize the country’s ride-hailing industry. 
 “The risk of violating consumer rights will be very large because there is no more opportunity to choose. There is only one price and no competition,” he said. 
 
  Photo credit: The Low Down 
 
 Abadi also urged the Business Competition Supervisory Commission (KPPU) to further its involvement in Grab and Gojek’s discussions to protect the rights of the general public. 
 In February,  The Information  reported that Grab and Gojek were  in talks  about a possible merger. Grab had told some of its investors that its archrival expects at least a 50% stake in the combined entity’s business in Indonesia for its own shareholders, the report said. 
 However, a Gojek spokesperson told  Tech in Asia  that the reports weren’t accurate, while Grab declined to comment on the matter. 
 Citing sources, the  Financial Times  reported earlier this week that “powerful shareholders” have pushed SoftBank to help bring the merger closer to reality after two years of on-and-off talks between the two companies. 
 “The forces at play here are higher than simply what Grab or Gojek want – or indeed don’t want. This is about a number of long-term influential shareholders in both companies who want to either stem the losses or find a way to exit their investments,” one Grab investor was quoted as saying in the report. 
 The Singapore-based unicorn counts companies such as SoftBank, Vertex Ventures, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and Booking Holdings, among others, as investors. Gojek’s backers, on the other hand, include the likes of Google, Tencent, and Temasek.

642041,FabHotels moves in on India as market leader Oyo downsizes," When Vaibhav Aggarwal went to Bangalore for a friend’s wedding seven years ago, he wasn’t too pleased with his accommodations. 
 He had paid around US$50 for a room at a hotel that promised a fancy lobby and restaurant. But three booking changes later, he had to settle for a room that “worked,” Aggarwal tells  Tech in Asia . That experience planted the seed for Casa2 Stays, a budget hotel aggregator that he co-founded with Adarsh Manpuria in 2014. The company runs and operates the FabHotels website and brand. 
 The six-year old startup is rapidly emerging as a worthy competitor to market leader Oyo Hotels and Homes. This comes as negative news about the Masayoshi Son-backed hotel room aggregator shows no signs of abating. Earlier this month,  Bloomberg   reported  that Oyo is culling its global staff by about 5,000 to 25,000 people. Oyo is downsizing its operations following years of rapid expansion as it focuses on profitability in 2020. The steepest cut would be in China, where the Covid-19 pandemic has triggered a slump, the company said. 
 In comparison, FabHotels is under no such pressure, contends Aggarwal. 
 “Our mantra has always been sustainable growth rather than growth at any cost,” says the Wharton-educated entrepreneur, who got a master’s degree in business from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “The average hotel owner, who is anywhere between 40 to 60 years old, doesn’t fully grasp the intricacies of managing a hotel,” he says, adding that they mostly sell rooms online or to corporations. 
 
   FabHotels co-founder Vaibhav Aggarwal  
 
 Right from the start, FabHotels focused on hospitality because it yielded a high return on investment as well as offered a promising profile of customers and “good” operational support, says Aggarwal. The average daily rate per night of about 1,900 rupees (US$25.61) is double that of Oyo’s 950 rupees (US$12.80), the co-founder claims. This translates into higher returns for our hotel partners, he says. Oyo uses dynamic prices across its multiple brands, a person familiar with the company’s thinking said. 
 Discovering a niche 
 Looking back at the Bangalore snafu, Aggarwal says he realized there was untapped potential in a market crowded with online travel and hotel aggregators. 
 Another friend who attended the 2013 wedding had booked a room for about US$20 a night. “While this small hotel lacked a lobby and a restaurant, the room was spick and span for an overnight stay,” Aggarwal recalls. “I wondered why such properties were not more easily discoverable.” 
 He and Manpuria decided to start FabHotels the following year after speaking to fellow travelers and corporate administrators who handle business trips. A common complaint was the lack of budget hotels for corporate travelers, shares Aggarwal. 
 When FabHotels began operations, it was bootstrapped with about US$100,000 and listed only four properties over 12 months. At the end of July 2015, Accel Partners and Qualcomm Ventures led the seed investment round with around US$2.3 million in total. 
 
   Photo credit: FabHotels  
 
 Today, the startup has about 11,000 rooms, and two-thirds are in India’s top eight cities and biggest business centers, says Aggarwal. More than 40% of FabHotels’ business comes from direct tie-ups with corporates, with 90% driven by business travelers, he says. FabHotels aims to have about 22,000 rooms in its inventory in the next 18 months. 
 The company has also benefited from hiring staff who understand the business. At present , around 175 out of its 800 employees have a hospitality background. 
 We don’t know yet if the situation has bottomed out or things are going to get worse from here. 
 However, Aggarwal doesn’t dismiss the challenges that come with being in an emerging market such as India. Oyo’s troubles have had a domino effect on the industry, with many hotel owners and customers hesitating to partner with online startups. 
 “Any high-growth company goes through growth pains,” he says in reference to Oyo. “I do think the overall ecosystem is resilient enough to withstand minor issues.” 
 As if that weren’t enough, the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted an already uncertain business environment. 
 “We are seeing a 20% to 25% decline in business travel,” notes Aggarwal. “We don’t know yet if the situation has bottomed out or things are going to get worse from here.” FabHotels is on wait-and-see mode to assess the pandemic’s full impact before making adjustments to its business, he says. 
 Profitability over growth 
 Aggarwal hopes that FabHotels’ operating metrics will help in raising funds despite the  tepid  climate for Indian startups. 
 FabHotels has a gross margin of over 20%, and it hopes to break even in the next four quarters. “Our monthly cash requirements have been reduced by more than half over the last six months,” he says. 
 That helped put the company’s valuation at US$100 million when it secured US$25 million in series B funding in 2019. Its series A round in 2016 valued the company at US$20 million. 
 FabHotels aims to raise further capital this year to invest in expansion and technology as well as online and offline distribution, says Aggarwal. “Our capital requirements have been minimal compared to competitors,” he adds. 
 The company is also focused on improving its  Net Promoter Score  (NPS), an industry management metric that measures customer experience. The NPS ranges from -100 to 100 and assesses a customer’s willingness to recommend a company’s products or services to others. 
 FabHotels has an NPS of 77% on the customer side, according to Aggarwal. 
 “If you are not able to keep your stakeholders (hotel partners and guests) happy, then you will not survive in this industry,” Aggarwal says.

642021,Bytedance’s music streaming app Resso has officially launched in Indonesia,"  Bytedance ’s music streaming platform Resso was officially launched in Indonesia on March 11 this year after undergoing a trial period since December 2019,  Daily Social  reported. Resso offers social sharing services to enable users to interact with each other while enjoying music.

 Resso displays lyrics in real-time and allows users to share their favorite parts of a song on social media platforms. Users can also leave comments under individual songs to spark or join discussions with community members. Moreover, Resso also generates music-accompanied GIFs and video clips. 
 According to the report, Resso will continue to add to its music catalog by collaborating with local and global music labels and music aggregator platforms. To date, Resso has partnered with various major music labels such as Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and T-Series. 
 Resso utilizes a freemium business model. To download tracks and listen to music without being interrupted by ads, the platform offers paid plans that cost US$3.37 for Android users and US$4.06 for iOS users. 
 In Indonesia, Resso faces competition from YouTube Music, Tencent’s Joox, and Spotify. 
 With this new app, Bytedance wants to springboard off the popularity of its viral video-sharing platform, TikTok. Indonesia is an important market for TikTok, as it had approximately 81 million downloads in the country as of May 2019, which made up about 42% of total downloads in Southeast Asia, estimated at 190 million last year.

641959,"Hoolah is tapping into a growing millennial demand to ‘buy now, pay later’ in Asia"," Suppose you were deliberating whether or not to purchase a US$1,500 television online. Instead of paying the full amount upfront, you’re now offered an option to pay just one-third of the price upfront, and spread out the remaining sum over the next two months. It’s a free-to-use option with zero interest, assuming subsequent payments are made on time. 
 For many, the choice could mean the difference between a purchase and an abandoned cart. 
 
  Hoolah COO Arvin Singh (L) and CEO Stuart Thornton (R) / Photo credit: Hoolah 
 
  Hoolah , a Singapore-based startup that offers such installments, says its service has increased average transaction values by up to 50% and conversion rates for merchants by 35%, on average. 
 Founded in 2017, the company is part of a growing trend of buy-now-pay-later platforms looking to tap into the millennial market – one of the fastest-growing segments of ecommerce globally. 
 The firm recently announced an  eight-figure series A fundraise , counting investors like Genting Ventures – the subsidiary of multinational firm Genting Group – and former Lazada CEO Max Bittner. The investment will go into expanding its presence in Malaysia and building out its omnichannel capabilities. 
 Its partnership with Genting Group could also propel its ambitions to expand into the travel and leisure segments, as the Malaysian conglomerate operates hotels, theme parks, and cruise lines across the globe. 
 ‘Paying later’ in developed markets 
 For Hoolah co-founders Stuart Thornton and Arvin Singh, the millennial demand for credit is universal. “It’s not always about affordability. It’s about cash flow for consumers, about the younger generation shifting from perhaps a desire to use debit cards rather than credit cards for transactions,” says Thornton, who is also the startup’s CEO. 
 While pay-later firms are a  growing force  in Indonesia where they serve a large unbanked population, there’s a huge potential in developed markets as well, as companies like  Affirm  and  Afterpay  show. 
 US-founded Affirm, which serves over 3,000 merchants, says that half of its customers are millennials or Generation Z. 
 Startups like Hoolah essentially offer what credit cards already do, but are free to use. Zero-interest installment plans also appeal to consumers’ unwillingness – and sometimes inability – to pay for big-ticket items upfront. Late-payment charges for these platforms are often more transparent, too. 
 
  Hoolah team / Photo credit: Hoolah 
 
 Hoolah, for example, imposes a late fee capped at S$30 (US$21) on outstanding charges that add up to S$1,000 (US$713) and above and less for lower amounts. Its late fees are not meant to serve as a revenue stream but to “motivate the right behaviors on repayments,” Singh says. 
 That’s a less risky option compared to an average 20% charge that credit cards in Singapore can incur for late payments. Add to this the compound interest structure that credit cards use, and customers can quickly spiral into debt. 
 Other entities such as furniture stores are now providing installment plans as well. Courts, a retailer for furniture and electronic products, offers this option, but it charges interest rates of at least 11% per annum. Customers can, however, opt to spread their payments over up to 60 months. 
 Another example is Australia-based furniture retailer Harvey Norman, which provides zero-interest installment plans for purchases of S$500 and above, though this is limited to selected credit cards. Installment plans for consumer goods beyond furniture stores are uncommon. 
 Hoolah’s service, on the other hand, expands installment payment to new consumer verticals – it partners with over 300 merchants from fashion and accessories, electronics, furniture, to skincare. It limits installment payments to three months.

 The startup allows customers to pay using any Mastercard- or Visa-issued card from any bank. 
 Hoolah’s merchants also absolve themselves from any credit and fraud risks associated with transactions and obtain full payments upfront for a fee, which the startup declined to disclose. As a benchmark, Melbourne-based pay-later firm Afterpay charges merchants an average of 3.8% per transaction, while Affirm charges merchants between 2% to 3%. 
 Profitability concerns 
 Despite the traction of pay-later companies worldwide, profitability remains in question. 
 Afterpay, which has operations in Australia, New Zealand, the US, and the UK, has seen impressive top-line growth: Total income for the company surged 96% year on year to A$220 million (US$142 million) for the first half of the fiscal year ended December 2019. 
 This came as underlying sales, or gross merchandise product, across the platform grew 106% and active customers more than doubled to 7.3 million year on year, for the same period. In August last year, the company claimed to be onboarding 12,500 new customers a day. 
 But costs have remained high in the first half, with operating expenses more than tripling to A$80.6 million (US$52 million), while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) decreasing by 51% to A$6.8 million (US$4.4 million) from the same period last year. 
 “The result compares favorably to our [expectations] broadly – except for EBITDA – with [volume] and customers ahead, stable merchant fee margins, and improving loss rates,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Tim Piper. 
 Hoolah did not disclose its gross merchandise volume but said the annual volume of transactions it processed grew 15x between 2018 to 2019. 
 Enter the payments giants 
 Last year, Afterpay entered into a strategic partnership with US payments giant Visa to support the development of innovative solutions and drive business growth in the US. The development came after Afterpay reported  almost A$1 billion (US$654 million)  in transaction volumes in its full year of operations in the US.

 Visa had in June last year  launched its own installment payment program  which let participating issuers and merchants offer installment payments to their customers with their existing Visa cards. 
 “To me, this is a serious problem for Visa,”  The Motley Fool  analyst Taylor Carmichael  said in a note . “If Afterpay wins over millennials (as it is doing), well, that’s the future. Visa has arguably validated the Afterpay model by announcing in late June that it is going to enter this business as well.” 
 He predicts that a large financial company like Visa, PayPal, or Square, or even one of the big US banks will acquire Afterpay down the line. 
 For its part, Mastercard is forging strategic partnerships with banks and fintech companies as well. In Australasia, Afterpay offers its interest-free installments via a tie-up with the payments giant to share technology, data, and service capabilities, Sandeep Malhotra, executive vice president for Mastercard’s products and innovations team in Asia Pacific, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Despite this, Hoolah is confident that its localized approach in each market gives it an edge over these payment firms. 
 “We have a deep relationship with the consumer – that’s where partnerships with these investors certainly can be helpful for them as well,” Singh says.

 Through collaborations with relevant industry stakeholders, PropertyGuru Finance will offer digital home financing services such as instant in-principle approval, offers, refinance checks, mortgage rates, digital tools that help property buyers make financing decisions, and personalized advisory for long-term benefits, according to a statement. 
 While 70% of Singaporeans will start saving before looking for a home to buy, only 18% are very familiar with the home loan process, the company said. 
 “The mortgage journey is full of uncertainty, doubt, and inefficiency. More often than not, the process leads people to paying more than they should. Its complexity may even cost them the opportunity to own their dream home,” said Bjorn Sprengers, chief marketing officer and head of fintech at PropertyGuru. 
 With PropertyGuru Finance, the company said it will act as a real estate agent’s personal mortgage assistant, helping to offer property seekers not only available properties but also home finance options on a single platform. 
 The move is in line with PropertyGuru’s vision as it moves from a property marketplace to a “trust platform” in Southeast Asia. “Our aspiration is to enable Singapore’s first digital straight-through mortgage application by 2022 and the first fully digital property transaction by 2025,” said Sprengers. 
 Launched in 2007, PropertyGuru claims it takes up over 75% market share in Singapore. It also operates in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(3, 0.9995385)]","['PropertyGuru', 'fintech']","['Singapore', 'Malaysia', 'Vietnam', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia']"
641992,Oyo left with skeleton crew in China after massive layoffs," SoftBank-backed Indian hotel chain  Oyo  is undergoing a massive downsizing in China, slashing more than 7,000 employees since November, according to a report by local media outlet  Jiemian .

 The number of employees at Oyo China has plunged from more than 9,800 in November 2019 to about 2,700 as of March 10, according to the report, adding that the number of employees has plummeted by thousands per month since the beginning of 2020. 
 The company has halved its employees from almost every department. The technical support team, for example, has seen a 60% cut, said a former Oyo China executive. 
 In addition to massive layoffs, eight senior management members have left the company since July, five of which are founding members of Oyo China, including vice president of marketing and brand Zhang Jiahao and the vice president of operations Han Feng. 
 In response to the report, Oyo said March 11 that the company has been optimizing and refining the regional management structure, which may include adjustments in headcount. The total number of employees affected “will come out in the next few weeks,” the firm added. 
 Since Oyo entered China in November 2017, it has signed up more than 10,000 hotels as franchisees. The company claimed to have more than 10,000 employees in China as of September 2019, and once announced plans to double that number by the end of 2020. However, the Indian startup has faced a slew of negative media reports about its China business since last year, including financing difficulties and a wave of layoffs. 
 Oyo’s annual losses for the fiscal year 2018 to 2019 increased by a figure of six to  US$335 million , compared to a net loss of US$52 million for the previous year. Its China operation posted US$197 million in net losses, accounting for nearly 60% of the total, according to the company’s 2019 annual report. 
 The firm has also reportedly started global layoffs recently, with a plan to let over 5,000 employees go in the ongoing restructuring process that kicked off in January.

 The money will fund ShopBack’s expansion into Asia and beyond its core cashback service. 
 Existing backers Rakuten, EDBI, EV Growth, Cornerstone Ventures, and 33 Capital have also chipped in. 
 The startup has now raised a total of US$113 million since its inception. The new funds will cushion it through a rough economy – which is impacting the retail and F&amp;B industry.

 In the past two years, the company has  extended into  physical retail rewards via ShopBack Go with the goal of replacing paper loyalty cards. 
 It’s been diversifying beyond cashback, allowing users to discover new deals on the app. In Taiwan, users can even perform price comparisons, ShopBack CEO and co-founder Henry Chan tells  Tech in Asia . 
 In 2018, the startup  acquired Seedly , a financial media company for millennials. 
 It has also been investing in growth. In the financial year ending March 2019, it has increased both its top-line and bottom-line figures. Chan notes, though, that its business in Singapore is already profitable in terms of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT).

 Revenue from its other markets, meanwhile, has been sufficient to cover local costs, he adds. 
 Commenting on the startup’s gross margins, Chan says that it’s more focused on “positive unit economics” at the moment. “We do look at margins. But margins at scale is more meaningful. At the end of the day, a revenue of US$10m to US$20m is nice but not sizable,” he explains. 
 The company is looking to expand the amount of sales flowing through its platform (or gross merchandise volume), which stood at US$2 billion in 2019. 
 Chan expects most of Shopback’s local operations to turn profitable within three to four years after they’re established. He declines to comment on financial numbers for the financial year ending March 2020. “We’re now trying to get to ‘ramen’ profitability,” he says. 
 The company is present in seven markets, including Southeast Asia’s largest countries as well as Taiwan and Australia. 
 In some of these markets, it’s finding itself bumping against stronger indirect competition. Fave, for example, offers cashback along with a slew of tools for SMEs. Grab has its own rewards program.

 Right now, all except two of ShopBack’s markets are still in the aggressive expansion phase. Chan, however, says he’s “putting a mandate for them to breakeven now and shortcutting their growth.” The cashback business is turning self-sustaining, he believes. 
 Meanwhile, part of the losses has been going into new product lines that could become new revenue streams in the future. 
 “We’re always running a margin-positive business. We don’t subsidize,” he says. ",Terence Lee,0,3,"[(0, 0.26657227), (1, 0.71387225), (3, 0.019473445)]","['app', 'ShopBack']","['Singapore', 'Seedly', 'Asia', 'Taiwan', 'Australia', 'EDBI']"

 Right-Hand provides software-as-a-service solutions that help companies monitor, measure, and mitigate human-induced cybersecurity risk. Its services are offered complementary to traditional perimeter defense technologies, like email security platforms and firewalls. 
 “There is a massive gap between what most employees know about cybersecurity and their day-to-day behaviors online that inflict immense cyber risk for themselves and their employer,” Right-Hand’s CEO, Theo Nasser, said. “Right-Hand aims to bridge that gap.” 
 The company will use the fresh capital to support its product roadmap by expanding its engineering, research, and data science teams, Nasser told  Tech in Asia.  
 “Although humans present one of the biggest loopholes in cybersecurity, much of the focus from both investors and corporates alike have been on various technical solutions like threat detection systems, firewalls, and such. The human aspect is often overlooked,” Atlas Ventures’ investment director, Maxim Shkvaruk, said. 
 Right-Hand’s solutions are being used within the government and financial sectors across Southeast Asia and Australia, according to a statement. 
 Currently, its platform analyzes employee behavior in real time, and then produces analytics and training modules to educate employees on their potentially risky behaviors. The company’s products also help users become less susceptible to phishing attempts and comply with internal policies. 
 Market research firm IDC expects global spending on security products and services to reach US$151.2 billion in 2023, with Asia Pacific contributing US$34 billion. 
 Nasser said that Right-Hand expects its market opportunity to further grow as organizations continue to introduce new technologies and communication channels into their business, concurrently giving cyber criminals more opportunities to exploit.

641845,Commentary: China’s manufacturing confidence soars. It could be a false rally," Amid the doom and gloom that the Covid-19 outbreak has brought to the global economy, there’s one bright spot: The China Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is signaling a strong rebound in March for the manufacturing industry. 
   
 Underpinning this optimism is the fact that 90% of Chinese state-owned companies have  begun operations once more . Several multinational factories have restarted production as well, albeit at lower capacity levels. 
 Are we past the worst? 
 With the confidence level so high and Chinese production expected to normalize by the end of March, it may be easy to think that we are out of the woods. Unfortunately, the situation isn’t that simple. 
 As seen in the chart below, while infections in China have started plateauing, incidents abroad – in South Korea, Europe, and the US – are only beginning to climb. The World Health Organization has classified the Covid-19 crisis as  a pandemic  and urged governments to step up measures to contain the virus from spreading further. 
   
 Since the outbreak began accelerating in January, global supply chains have been disrupted as factories in China closed down in an effort to contain the virus. The chart below shows that this has severely affected the Chinese economy, with output, new orders, and employment all falling to record lows. Inventory backlog in the country has also accumulated at its fastest pace in nearly 15 years. 
   
 Profit warnings spike 
 Uncertain macroeconomic conditions have caused business activities to falter, leading to a deluge of profit warnings from companies across the world. 
 Hardware firms such as iPhone maker Foxconn  forecast  a 15% drop in first quarter revenue as it struggles to get production back to normal. Auto manufacturers such as Hyundai have suffered similar setbacks – the carmaker  suspended  operations at its factory complex in South Korea due to a lack of components from Chinese suppliers. Even Chinese internet giants Baidu and Weibo weren’t spared, with both companies  expecting  revenue this quarter to fall by up to 13% and 20%, respectively. 
 With the virus spreading worldwide and hampering the global economy, the impact on China may be significant even if authorities succeed in containing the outbreak in the mainland. 
 The pandemic will likely cut global demand as consumers everywhere err on the side of caution and limit outside activities. Governments are scrambling to curb the outbreak. The  US has suspended  all travel from Europe, except the UK, for 30 days effective March 13. Italy recently placed the entire country on lockdown. 
 Startups hit 
 Conferences have been canceled across many industries, which translates to fewer business opportunities in the short term around the world. For the tech industry alone, various conferences like South by Southwest, Google’s I/O 2020, F8, and the Mobile World Congress have all been suspended. The cancelation of the Mobile World Congress in itself amounts to a  US$480 million  economic loss, according to PredictHQ. 
 Air travel is another sector that’s suffering. The International Air Transport Association recently warned that the airline industry could lose  US$113 billion  this year due to the virus. The pessimism is spreading to other industries, with eight in 10 startups saying their businesses have been negatively affected, according to a  Tech in Asia   survey  conducted in February. 
   
 Even the release of the hotly anticipated James Bond  movie ,  No Time to Die , has been delayed indefinitely due to fears of poor sales at the box office. The NBA too has just cut short its current season after a player  tested positive for the novel coronavirus . 
 Few industries will be immune from the upcoming economic slowdown arising from the coronavirus pandemic. 
 Central banks can’t save us 
 In response to the worsening crisis, central banks have initiated monetary policy measures to ease the economic impacts of the outbreak. Most recently, the Federal Reserve  slashed  interest rates by 50 basis points – the most since the global financial crisis of 2008 – to cushion the US economy. 
 Governments have also rolled out fiscal stimulus packages to help small and medium-sized enterprises across countries to weather the storm. The Singapore government is giving a S$4 billion (US$2.9 billion)  support package  to businesses that have been severely hit by the outbreak. China is also providing US$60 billion in  loans  to help the most vulnerable firms stay afloat. 
 However, these measures won’t be enough to prop up the global economy. While lower borrowing costs and fiscal stimulus might be effective in increasing demand during normal conditions, both will have little sway when people fear for their safety. Such moves may mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic, but they are unlikely to prevent a major slowdown. 
 Ultimately, if it takes too long to bring the pandemic under  control , governments will have to choose between letting it run its course (similar to a seasonal flu) in order to keep economic activity alive or enact strict quarantines aimed at safeguarding public health but can sink the economy. 
 The global economy is likely to get a lot worse before it gets better. Indeed, Sequoia Capital has dubbed the Covid-19 outbreak as the  black swan event of 2020  that could put the brakes on the global economy for a long time.

 Founded by 21-year-old entrepreneurs Kush Taneja and Sambhav Jain, FamPay claims to be the first payments app for teenagers and their families in India. 
 The app allows teenagers to get a card without a bank account. With the FamCard, they can purchase online and in-store goods, as well as make peer-to-peer, card, and unified payments interface payments. Parents can also top up their child’s FamPay account and let them spend the funds under their supervision. 
 In August last year, FamPay launched an experiment to test the market opportunity, where it attracted over 20,000 users in seven days, the company claims. It said that gamification and social elements that encouraged sharing contributed to the growth. 
 “Most of the products built in India are focused on adults, and there’s nothing out there for teenagers between the age of 12 and 18 years,” said Taneja. “[Generation] Z expects a combination of something cool, trustworthy, and social, and that’s the sweet spot we are working day and night to cater to.”

 The new errand service promises to deliver everything from groceries, beverages, medicines, and even flowers within a city, with a starting rate of 12 yuan (US$1.72) for the first four kilometers, 20 yuan for a delivery distance of four to 10 kilometers, and 30 yuan for a distance higher than 10 kilometers. 
 Didi piloted the service in Chengdu and Hangzhou, with drivers from the firm’s dedicated service Didi Chauffeur as the first batch of errand runners. The service will be launched in more cities, and Didi will start recruiting new employees soon, the firm told  KrAsia . 
 Didi added that its errand service will become an additional income source for Didi Chauffeur’s drivers. Its dedicated driver business, which provides qualified drivers to car owners, has been hit heavily amid the coronavirus outbreak, as people are reluctant to go outside or drive their own cars. 
 As many as 11.4 billion express deliveries were completed in China in 2018, up 23% from the previous year, according to  the State Post Bureau , which regulates the country’s postal service provider, China Post. That translates to a market worth 90.5 billion yuan (US$12.7 billion). 
 Food delivery giants such as Meituan Dianping and Ele.me have already tapped into this fast-growing market before Didi. Meituan, China’s largest on-demand services platform, tapped its takeout delivery fleet to offer an intra-city errand service from March 2017. Its main rival, Alibaba’s Ele.me, followed suit a month later. 
 For intra-city deliveries in Hangzhou, Meituan charges 8 yuan as a starting rate, going up 1 yuan per kilometer within six kilometers and 2 yuan for deliveries from six to 100 kilometers away. In contrast, Ele.me has a starting rate of 10 yuan in Hangzhou but does not specify its pricing rules for delivery radius. These companies all have different prices, depending on the city. 
 Didi has already tested the waters in China’s on-demand sector. It made a foray into food delivery services in April 2018 with a pilot launch in Wuxi, Jiangsu. However, the company halted domestic food delivery expansion several months later, when it had to manage a big crisis after multiple sexual assaults and murders occurred in Didi’s carpooling service. 
 Recently, the company announced plans to officially launch a food delivery service in Japan starting from April, challenging Uber Eats – the service provided by its main rival in the Japanese market, Uber Technologies –  KrAsia  reported.

641815,Sales automation startup Novocall bags $500k in 500 Startups-led round," Singapore-based sales automation firm  Novocall  has secured S$700,000 (US$500,000) in a seed round led by 500 Durians, the Southeast Asia-focused fund of Silicon Valley VC firm 500 Startups. 
 500 Startups Thailand and Expara Asia Ventures, as well as angel investors such as Exabytes’ founder and CEO, Chan Kee Siak, also participated in the round, according to a statement.

 Novocall is a business-to-business software-as-a-service company that provides conversational sales solutions, which automate sales processes for agents and give them more information about their clients. “This helps sales and marketing teams drive more pipelines from the same traffic,” said the firm’s co-founder and CEO, Huang Jing Jie. 
 With the new capital, the company said it will be able to accelerate its product and customer development. While the company currently has clients in Singapore and Malaysia, it plans to expand to more markets in the region, particularly in Indonesia and Thailand. 
 To date, Novocall claims that its services are being used by over 2,000 businesses across 42 countries globally, clocking in over 400,000 minutes on its platform through 100,000 calls. It also serves small- and medium-sized enterprises, notably those in the education and travel sectors. 
 Novocall was founded in January 2018 by Huang, Jionghan Ng, and Amos Choo – alumni of the Singapore University of Technology and Design. 
 It had previously received a grant of S$30,000 (US$21,600) from Enterprise Singapore’s SG Founder Grant, in partnership with the Singapore Management University’s Business Innovation Generator, and went through an acceleration program with UOB’s FinLab.

641804,US-based medtech firm Breath-Dx raises funds from Singapore VC firm,"  Breath Diagnostics Inc. (Breath-Dx) , a US-based breath analysis platform, today announced that it has secured an undisclosed amount of investment from HealthXCapital, a Singapore-based healthcare-focused venture capital firm.

 With the investment, the two organizations will seek pan-Asian investment, conduct clinical studies, and implement market penetration strategies across the US and Asia, according to a statement. Following the investment, Arda Minocherhomjee, a HealthXCapital representative and a managing partner of the Chicago Growth Fund, will join Breath-Dx’s board of directors. 
 Founded in 2014, Breath-Dx said it aims to create a non-invasive, easy-to-use, and affordable diagnostic tool for lung cancer screening. It has developed a platform called OneBreath, which detects lung cancer by analyzing a single exhaled breath. 
 The platform picks up “volatile organic markers,” giving it the potential to expand into identifying other cancer indications, as well as a variety of other disease states, according to the statement. The test will also be used to monitor potential cancer recurrence even after surgery. 
 The company plans to use the new funds to develop its product, scale manufacturing to support clinical trials, and build management infrastructure. 
 Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and Asia constitutes over 51% of lung cancer incidences, the company said. 
 “Despite the region’s dramatic growth in recent decades, cancer screening in Asia is still a challenge, thus exposing the vast majority of the population to cancer risks,” said Seemant Jauhari, a partner at HealthXCapital.

641800,Lippo Group makes strategic investment in Singapore payments startup MoolahGo," Lippo Group, a multinational conglomerate based out of Indonesia, has made a strategic investment in Singapore fintech startup  MoolahGo  for an undisclosed sum as part of its pre-series A raise.

 Prior to this financing round, MoolahGo announced in March last year that it had received seed funding from Eric Barbier, the founder and former CEO of payments firm Thunes (previously known as TransferTo). 
 Established in 2018, MoolahGo operates an online financial service marketplace that connects consumers, businesses, and providers directly, removing the need for traditional intermediaries. After starting out in the business-to-consumer and customer-to-customer markets, the multicurrency payments firm has since expanded to offer services to enterprise clients. 
 Effective from January this year, the startup is also considered as a major payment institution licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore under the new Payment Services Act. 
 MoolahGo said it plans to use the fresh funds to bring the other payment services it has been developing to market, including mobile payments, and looks to deploy part of the new capital to open up new markets in the region. 
 With the investment, the Lippo Group has broadened its portfolio of fintech services. The Indonesian services giant also established digital payments firm Ovo in 2016 and made it into one of the country’s local unicorns. 
 In late 2019, Lippo founder Mochtar Riady confirmed that his group had  sold over 70% of its stake in Ovo  and is keeping the rest, citing the company’s spending as the reason for the divestment.  The Jakarta Post  reported at the time that Lippo was pouring US$50 million a month into the e-wallet startup.

641541,"Bytedance poaching Facebook, Google talent in Singapore push"," Bytedance is on the hunt for over a hundred new employees in Singapore as it shapes up for a  possible initial public offering  later this year and tries to extend its footprint outside of China. 
 It has poached plenty of top tech talent from the likes of Facebook, Google, and Grab in recent months to staff its growing office in the city-state.

 The Beijing-based company may also be planning to set up its new ad network in Singapore, making Southeast Asia the cornerstone of its global monetization strategy. 
 Monetization drive 
 At the time of writing, Bytedance was advertising for 68 positions in Singapore – more than in any of its other offices apart from Beijing and Mountain View, California – while its flagship video app TikTok had another 42 live job ads in the city-state. 
 People who have recently moved to senior roles in Bytedance’s Singapore office came from big tech players including Facebook, Grab, Google, Microsoft, and Accenture. 
 Many of the roles filled in the last few months or that are currently being advertised – including sales, client account management, and data-related jobs – appear to be centred around monetization of Bytedance’s various platforms. 
 Since closing  a US$3 billion funding round  in late 2018 the company has been rumored to be preparing for an IPO, with either Hong Kong or New York said to be the likely venue. It  recently denied rumors  that it would seek to float in Hong Kong during the first quarter of 2020. Its listing plans may, in any case, be delayed due to the continuing spread of Covid-19, which Sequoia Capital dubs the  black swan event  that could trigger a global economic slowdown. 
 Bytedance’s two key products – short-video streamer TikTok (known as Douyin in China) and news app Jinri Toutiao – rely on ads to generate revenue, which could take a hit if the economy stalls. 
   
 One notable post on Bytedance’s careers portal is an invitation to apply as the head of Pangle, which is described as the company’s  global ad network . 
 A web search for Pangle leads to a URL for Ocean Engine, which appears to be an earlier incarnation of Bytedance’s ads sales platform. 
 A Bytedance spokesperson told  Tech in Asia  that Pangle is already available in Japan, but didn’t confirm whether its global headquarters will be in Singapore or which other markets it may expand to. 
 However, a  privacy policy  on the Ocean Engine site indicates that the name “Pangle” refers to “Bytedance Pte. Ltd. incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Singapore.” 
 According to the Bytedance representative, Pangle is a video advertising platform offering “interactive and high performing in-app advertising solutions.” The platform “aggregates high-quality ad inventory from a vast number of mobile apps and provides the inventory to advertisers on an auction basis.” 
 The company welcomes “people from all backgrounds,” the spokesperson adds. “If tackling challenges in a fast-changing industry does not scare you then working with us is your next step as we challenge you to move the world.” 
 Ease of doing business? 
 If Bytedance does decide to set up Pangle’s headquarters in Singapore, it wouldn’t be the first time it has done so for one of its subsidiaries. 
  Lark , the company’s workplace productivity suite, is also based in the city-state. Lark Technologies Pte Ltd, the Bytedance unit that develops the product, was incorporated in Singapore in November 2018. 
 The company spokesperson didn’t share why Bytedance picked Singapore as the base for Lark. 
 But the city-state’s business environment has a sterling reputation, consistently landing in the top three spots of the  World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index  for the past 13 years. In comparison, China remains lower down the list despite making significant progress, taking 31st place as of 2019.

 Likewise, Singapore ranked fourth – along with Switzerland and Sweden – in Transparency International’s  2019 Corruption Perceptions Index while  China was at 80th place. 
 These rankings may go some way towards explaining Bytedance’s decision to locate some of its services in the city-state. 
 The company has also faced censorship in China. In April 2018, Jinri Toutiao was  removed from app stores  at the behest of the Chinese government, purportedly to “regulate order in the broadcasting environment.” TikTok has since  faced criticism  for kowtowing to the authorities in Beijing by allegedly censoring its users’ videos.

641603,The 4 most important economies in the world for startups," I believe the countries that provide the best growth environment for startups today are in Southeast Asia. 
 Usually, the US, China, and India get all the attention, but for startups, Southeast Asia is where the real action is. Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia have just the right mix of economic growth, population size, investment, and entrepreneurial ferment to make them the critical countries in the world for these companies. 
   
 These markets are among the fastest growing in the world, and together, they have an  average gross domestic product growth rate  of 5.3%. Vietnam has the fastest growth, with 7.1% in 2018. 
 These countries have large populations where the young make up a significant share. Combined, they have a total population of  more than 460 million , with  tech-oriented under-25s  accounting for two out of every five citizens. 
 This is partly why the internet economies in these four countries are rapidly growing.  Research by Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company  puts internet economy growth in Indonesia as high as 49% per year since 2015. Even Malaysia, which is at the lower end of the regional spectrum with 20% annual growth rates, is a standout compared to most other countries in the world. 
 One for all 
 Business models that work well in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, or Malaysia will often be transferrable to other countries inthe region. That’s not to say that you can afford to underestimate local conditions. Indonesian unicorn Gojek is expanding via local “founder teams” and brand names in other countries, for instance. 
 But in all four economies, startups are helping solve problems that are common to their populations. That might mean bringing financial services to the previously unbanked or helping farmers get better prices for their goods. It could also mean serving the large fast-growing middle-class market with entertainment, delivery, travel, and other services. 
 “If you are growing in any one of these countries, you can use the same marketing channels to expand into the others,” Duco van Breemen, general manager of Sydney-based startup hub Haymarket HQ, told me. With his experience in the field, he has advised hundreds of founders. 
 If your business is located in one of these countries, you could also get a helping hand worth at least US$50,000 a year for an early-stage startup, said van Breemen. Local governments are aggressively courting startups with visas, grants, free co-working spaces, and networking programs. 
  The Malaysia Digital Hub , for example, offers free or easy visas, company registration, banking, housing, and connections to mentors and entrepreneurs. They make it extremely easy for foreign founders to grow their businesses in Malaysia as well. 
 Similar programs are on offer in the other countries. In Thailand, for example, the  Board of Investment  promotes investment with a range of support and services. Indonesia hopes  its programs , which include workshops, hackathons, bootcamps, and incubation programs, will help startups succeed in its vast market. 
 Malaysia 
 Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, has the country’s best startup climate. The successes that have been born there include ride-sharing giant Grab, wedding portal Wedding.com.my, deal site Sale Duck, and fintech firm iMoney. 
 One of Malaysia’s biggest advantages is that English is the country’s second-most spoken language. Most locals speak it fluently. 
 Compared to nearby Singapore, labor, housing, and office expenses are significantly cheaper.  Statistics on Numbeo  show that rent is 308% higher in Singapore than in Kuala Lumpur, eating out costs 120% more, and overall consumer prices are 90% higher. Your funding will go much further in Malaysia. 
 Meanwhile, Singapore and its wealthy investors are only a 60-minute flight away. 
 Thailand 
 Thailand is no longer just a great place for a beach vacation. Its fast-growing internet economy, high quality of life, low cost of living, and regional connectivity provide startups with tremendous opportunities. Thailand has Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy. 
 Its capital Bangkok is by far the most favorable city for a startup. Personally, I think it has the best pool of recruits, largest investor community, and most extensive startup ecosystem in the country. Regional center Chiang Mai is a distant second. 
 You can rent a high-quality  co-working space  in central Bangkok for about US$12 per day, and the  monthly cost of living  for a single person can be as little as US$650. Your bootstrapping can go much further with lower expenses. 
 It’s good to note though that Thailand doesn’t have the fastest-growing economy among its Southeast Asian peers. It does offer a large market that’s full of opportunities and a government eager to use startup grants and other assistance to push its country into a future that it calls “ Thailand 4.0 .” 
 Vietnam 
 A 2019 report from  StartupBlink  shows that of the countries discussed here, Vietnam has the least developed startup ecosystem, and I believe that is true. Despite this, its economy is thriving, thanks to the investment displaced from China due to the trade war. 
  Foreign direct investment jumped 7.2%  in fiscal year 2019 as manufacturers moved production to Vietnam to avoid higher costs and tariffs in China. The northern port city of Haiphong, home to at least 90 companies with Greater China investment, saw its gross domestic product surge by 16% in 2019 alone. 
 Vietnam has a large population of 95 million. Despite its communist past, I believe the country has an almost national obsession for technology and entrepreneurship. 
 Take Vietnamese coder Dong Nguyen’s story, for instance. In 2013, the Hanoi native created the game Flappy Bird, which still has the Apple App Store record for the most downloads in a single month.  CNET  recently named Flappy Bird one of the  25 most important apps  of the decade, alongside such giants as Twitter, Facebook, and Google Maps. 
 Because of success stories like this, Vietnam’s startup ecosystem attracted  triple the investment  in 2018 and 2017, hitting almost US$900 million. There are huge opportunities in the market. In fintech alone, a recent survey found  120 Vietnamese companies operating in the space . The mobile payments market could also expand by 18% a year to reach nearly  US$71 billion by 2025 . 
 Indonesia 
 In a region full of unpolished gems, Indonesia is the largest of all. Yes, it struggles with poor governance and infrastructure. Even so, it has a bigger population and economy than Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia put together, offering businesses unparalleled opportunities. 
 Francisco Widjojo, managing partner at private investment firm Arkblu Capital, told me that smart entrepreneurs see the challenges of doing business in Indonesia as a barrier to entry. The business environment protects you from new competitors, especially from offshore rivals. 
 “We focus on businesses that target the mass market,” he said. “Price point is very important. You can build brand loyalty not just in the major cities like Jakarta, but right across the country.” 
 Mass market strategies make sense in Indonesia because of the huge size of its population, the fourth largest in the world. The country already has four unicorns -Bukalapak, Tokopedia, Traveloka, and Ovo – in addition to the decacorn ride-hailing company, Gojek (see my analysis  here ). The government wants three more unicorns by 2024, and the internet economy is forecast to grow to  US$100 billion by 2025 . 
 For founders, it helps that Indonesia is the second-largest recipient of venture capital in Southeast Asia, behind only Singapore. The government’s push to eliminate poverty and become a prosperous country by 2045 provides many opportunities as well. 
 Whether you choose Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, or Vietnam, or choose to operate across all of these large Southeast Asian economies, I believe they provide the best growth environment in the world today.

 The new version – which will be released in China as soon as this month – will focus on cloud-based file management as well as document and spreadsheet editing, according to the report. 
 Lark, known as Feishu in China, was launched in April 2019 and provides remote-work services, allowing people to chat, conduct calls and meetings, access calendars, and use cloud storage. 
 With a team of over 1,700 people, the division that handles Lark is led by Xin Xie, a Bytedance vice president who reports directly to CEO Yiming Zhang, said sources. 
 As the Covid-19 outbreak spread and Chinese companies encouraged remote work, Lark gained traction, with daily downloads in the country reaching up to 22,000 in February. Bytedance will leverage this traction, focusing on the Chinese market and targeting individual users, according to the report. 
 The size of the global collaboration software market is projected to reach  US$16.6 billion  by 2025, rising at a compound annual growth rate exceeding 9% from 2018 to 2025.

641782,Behind CXA’s difficult journey to launching its ambitious insurtech platform," Like many others that have taken the same road, Singapore insurtech startup  CXA Group  is finding that it isn’t easy to transform itself into a technology company. 
 Scaling its insurance brokerage business into a technology-led, software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform required a hefty investment, but the challenges haven’t stopped at spending.

 The increasing demands of its new platform have placed pressure on its cash flow and forced the company to retrench staff, according to some employees. Last week,  Tech in Asia  reported  layoffs at the startup , a move that was necessary to keep its business “trim,” according to founder and CEO Rosaline Chow Koo. 
 “What we got rid of were either non-performers or roles that were automated, or were made redundant with this new model,” Koo tells  Tech in Asia . “As a startup, you don’t have that much money for extra fat.” 
 The job cuts come amid fundraising efforts and negotiations with current investors. The new funds will help sustain CXA’s operations before the platform’s launch, which is expected sometime this month or in April. 
 “Many of our existing investors – either from series A, B, or our  US$25 million round  – are topping up right now,” Koo says. “We need more money because we have 150 tech people now. It’s an evolution of our business.” 
 While Koo had announced that CXA was looking to raise a fresh US$50 million round last September, she clarifies that this current fundraising is part of an earlier tranche of investment. 
 Becoming a tech company 
 Koo set up CXA in 2013 after a stint at Mercer Marsh Benefits, using US$5 million of her life savings. “I was in this industry for eight years and I ran 14 countries,” the chief executive explained in a  2014 interview .

 She observed that companies faced similar issues around corporate health insurance, irrespective of geography. 
 “Companies’ insurance benefits are rising exponentially fast, yet employees don’t understand insurance. At the same time, every employee’s health is getting worse, but because healthcare and insurance are so paper-intensive and there are so many different vendors in the supply chain, HR has way too much work,” Koo said at the time. 
 For years, CXA was dependent on a brokerage team that went door to door to acquire new clients, but its new software-led platform has the potential to change that. Large banks and insurers that have signed long-term contracts with the startup will instantly give it access to the “hundreds of thousands” of corporate clients. 
 “So if they license the CXA platform and offer it to all of their SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), and then the apps are used for each employee of those SMEs or large corporate clients, I don’t have to go door to door anymore,” Koo says. 
 CXA’s ambitious platform will be licensed to major banks and insurers, which can then sell healthcare benefits to their clients at a cost savings of between 15% and 35%. It does this by eliminating  third-party administrators  fees and connecting directly to doctors, clinics, e-pharmacies, gyms, and more. 
 At present, CXA’s brokerage business accounts for 95% of its revenue. But that will change as it becomes a SaaS platform, where it will earn a licensing fee on top of a cut it gets from every transaction that takes place in its ecosystem of health and wellness partners. 
 An expensive platform 
 CXA couldn’t build the platform alone. To do so, it hired global software consultancy ThoughtWorks, which also helped to build Gojek’s platforms, under the recommendation of Openspace Ventures, one of its series A investors. ThoughtWorks would help to fast track CXA’s transition into a software-led platform with minimal configuration so it could be replicated for multiple clients. 
 ThoughtWorks has a reputation for being costly: It charged CXA between US$500,000 to nearly US$1 million monthly for the 10 months it was engaged, according to estimates by former employees. 
 Koo declined to disclose the exact amount, but she admitted that the software vendor’s services were “very expensive,” adding that CXA is “still paying off” the bill.

 It was believed that the potential value of SaaS platform would justify the expense, an ex-employee familiar with the matter says. In theory, a SaaS model achieves better unit economics and is easier to scale compared to a customized solution. 
 Several former employees say “opposing forces” between strategy and execution teams have delayed development, as clients continued to be assured that they would get customization, even though that’s incompatible with the newly built software platform. 
 At the same time, migrating existing clients to a new SaaS platform would have entailed “difficult conversations” about losing the customization they were promised, and “nobody wanted that,” an ex-employee explains. 
 “There’s not going to be much customization,” Koo clarifies. “75% to 80% of the platform we’re building is completely reusable.” While the platform has been co-developed by HSBC and other clients, it will be one that “many clients can use.” 
 The platform is also still being fine-tuned. 
 “For one client, we’re probably launching this month or April – depending on when we get all the sign-offs,” Koo says. “Another one is launching in May, [then] another one in June. You’re going to see quite a few launches coming up in the next few months.” 
 A hiring spree 
 As development of the ThoughtWorks-built platform reached a certain stage, CXA ramped up hiring in both Singapore and Vietnam late last year. Because the startup wanted to own the intellectual property, it replaced ThoughtWorks with “70 people in Vietnam and a lot of new people in Singapore,” says Koo.

 A  hub set up in Ho Chi Minh  houses CXA’s new technology team in Vietnam. A previous employee says that it was critical to recruit quickly in the country in order to reduce ThoughtWorks-related costs. 
 CXA added a total of about 100 people between 2018 and 2019. “When you hire that fast, you may not hire all the right people,” Koo notes. “In some places, we probably hired too many.” 
 This rapid upsizing placed pressure on some existing teams and long-tenured staff, hurting the company’s “incredible” culture in the process, former employees contend. 
 A number of existing and former employees say that teams were asked to drive the company towards unicorn status “at any cost.” Within weeks, a workplace that an ex-staff describes as challenging and fun  became one that generated a “strong feeling of being unsafe” in many, with their jobs hanging on the line. 
 Several employees witnessed colleagues being shouted at and “belittled” in front of other staff, their confidence “shattered.” 
 I have been fairly vocal about making the hard decisions to push out toxic leaders.  
 Those who pushed back on management decisions or who questioned practices quickly fell out of favor and were “shut up and pushed out,” ex-employees allege. 
 “Questioning has always been fine at CXA,” Koo says. “I’ve found that in startups, leadership and alignment matters much more than in established firms as time and resources are scarce.” 
 Sources say that the dramatic change in culture led to employees’ subsequent dismissals or resignations as working conditions turned hostile. Many recent hires had an average tenure of just a few months. 
 “We cannot afford to have leaders who do not perform or [who] spread negativity across the organization,” Koo points out. “I have been fairly vocal about making the hard decisions to push out toxic leaders to ensure that we do not have a hostile or political working environment. Culture really matters for startup success.” 
 Some have blamed politicking within the company for its internal struggles, citing competing interests as well as differing cultures and expectations between longtime staff and employees hired within the last six to nine months. 
 “There are some incredibly smart people in CXA and some incredibly great people to work with – from a professional, friendship and cultural level,” one ex-employee says. “That part was fantastic.” 
 Operational setbacks 
 Koo believes the Covid-19 outbreak is among the “operational challenges” that the startup faces. But a source tells  Tech in Asia  that signs of trouble began late last year, marked by high-profile resignations including Neil Persaud, the company’s chief people officer who was also a member of the board. 
 Several leadership members – including the heads of strategy, product, marketing, ecommerce, and partnerships – have either left or were replaced in the last couple of months, former employees observe.

 In addition to letting staff go,  Tech in Asia  understands that CXA is also cutting back on commercial contracts for paid software as the company races to secure new funds to meet vendor and payroll obligations. 
 Current and former employees have voiced concerns about the startup’s steep expenses and burn rates, based on conversations they had with senior management employees. 
 In response to queries about CXA’s cash flow, Koo says the startup currently has a runway of six months, but she’s hopeful that the new funds will extend that to nine in order to tide the company over until its series C round. 
 “We’ve spent a huge amount of money and [now] the platform’s finished and we’re about to launch,” Koo says. “What [the new fundraise] does is it gives us the rest of the runway to finish that part of the platform and launch that.” 
 Shareholder Openspace Ventures is satisfied with the progress of CXA. “We are confident that the CXA team has built one of the best insurtech platforms in the region and is well positioned for its next phase of growth through its software-driven business model,” a spokesperson for the fund tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Despite the difficulties, Koo remains optimistic. “We’re getting to the really neat stage,” Koo says. “It took me six years, but we’re actually becoming a tech company.” ",Melissa Goh,0,8,"[(0, 0.041971676), (2, 0.76957446), (3, 0.18843)]","['SaaS', 'Gojek', 'HSBC', 'CXA', 'ThoughtWorks']","['Asia', 'Vietnam', 'Singapore', 'Commonwealth']"
641769,Honestbee retrenches 80% of staff following Habitat’s temporary closure," Struggling online food and grocery delivery startup  Honestbee  has retrenched about 80% of its staff, or roughly 100 of its 130-strong team, following the temporary shut down of its supermarket Habitat. 
 The company also told its staff that payment of their salaries and contributions for February will be delayed until it acquires further funding,  The Straits Times  reported.

 In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Honestbee told  Tech in Asia  that the company the company made the decision due to “several external commercial pressures” that led to Habitat’s temporary closure. “The company has decided to reduce its non-core staff as it does not foresee operating Habitat at its full strength over the next few weeks.” 
 Most of those affected were Habitat’s operational staff in culinary, service, retail, and warehousing, the spokesperson added. 
 In February, Honestbee announced that it would temporarily close down its grocery store amid the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak and a decline in the business’ walk-in customers. Habitat’s landlord, LHN Space Resources, had also been unwilling to extend the lease. 
 The company’s management has decided to continue the suspension of Habitat’s operations “in view of the difficult commercial circumstances” until further notice, the Honestbee spokesperson said. 
 According to a  court document  seen by  Tech in Asia  late last month, Honestbee is mulling over the permanent closure of Habitat, as continuing to run Habitat would incur “significant overheads and working capital,” said CEO Lay Ann Ong. 
 The document also showed that talks with an overseas retail conglomerate for a US$50 million injection have stalled, as the large company is reluctant to “fund the debt restructuring” of Honestbee and is concerned over the “uncertainty” caused by the coronavirus outbreak, said Ong.

641744,Alipay to open up platform to 40 million service providers in China,"  Alipay , the mobile payment service operated by Alibaba’s Ant Financial Services, announced it will open up its platform to 40 million service providers to become a one-stop platform for various digital services. 
 The move marks a positional shift for the company, which has previously been focused on providing financial services.

 To help users cope with the impact of Covid-19, Alipay said it introduced an incentive program that lets developers create mini programs on the platform. Within a week, it saw over 1,200 developers respond and 181 mini programs created, according to a statement. The services include grocery delivery, legal and medical consultation, and logistics, among others. 
 According to Alipay, consumer demand for digital services has been growing rapidly, with searches for lifestyle services on the Alipay app increasing by 300% in 2019 alone. 
 To carry out the initiative, Alipay will update its platform to let service providers tap into traffic within the Alipay app. In addition, service providers will be able to leverage Alipay mini programs, which can run on all major platforms within the Alibaba ecosystem such as Tmall and AutoNavi, to reach a broader audience. 
 Under the three-year plan, Alipay will also work with 50,000 independent software vendors (ISVs) to support service providers, increase efficiencies, and help them reach more customers by 2030. ISVs are companies that package Alipay’s technologies into solutions to meet the needs of specific industries, including consumer retail, food and beverage, hospitality, transportation, and medical services. 
 Alipay added support for mini programs in September 2017 to make it easier for third-party services to join the app’s ecosystem. It looked to take on WeChat’s own instant apps, which it launched earlier in January 2017. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(2, 0.9995386)]","['app', 'Alipay']","['Alibaba', 'Alipay']"
641739,Malaysian court dismisses Grab’s request to review decision on $20.9m fine," Malaysia’s High Court yesterday dismissed Grab’s request to review the proposed decision of Malaysia Competition Commission (MyCC) back in October 2019 to fine the ride-hailing giant US$20.9 million for abusing its dominant position to prevent drivers from “promoting and providing advertising services for its competitors.”

 According to a local media report, Grab’s application was considered “premature” and therefore dismissed. A spokesperson for Grab told  KrAsia  that the company will file for an appeal because “this is an issue of significant public importance not only for Grab, but also for the wider business community.” 
 Grab has repeatedly said that the company has fully complied with Malaysia’s Competition Act 2010 and that it is a common practice for “businesses to have a say on the availability and type of third-party advertising that appears alongside its service” to protect user experience. 
 Although this case in Malaysia is not related to the Grab-Uber merger, Grab is still entangled in several legal headaches across Southeast Asia due to its dominant position following the merger. 
 Today in Ho Chi Minh City, Grab Vietnam is attending a hearing to appeal the decision coming out of a lengthy lawsuit between Grab and traditional taxi firm Vinasun. 
 The lawsuit, which has already lasted 18 months, was the first of its kind in Vietnam between a tech company – a disruptor – and a firm whose business model was under existential threat. Grab was initially ordered to pay Vinasun US$208,700 in damages.

 With the new fund, Lyra looks to focus on global opportunities, particularly in Southeast Asia, the US, Israel, and Europe, the company told  Tech in Asia . The firm also said it’s interested in working with companies that are ready to expand to Japan and Southeast Asia. 
 The deal with TSI complements Lyra’s existing partnership with Japanese ecommerce firm Zozo, according to a statement. 
 Formerly known as Start Today Ventures, Lyra was founded in 2017 to support companies across the fashion value chain, including new-retail models, SaaS businesses, and materials innovation. 
 According to the company, the fashion and retail industry is rapidly changing, with companies investing more in digital platforms, AI analytics, and processing technologies, among others. 
 The firm earlier invested in Syte AI, an Israel-based visual AI company whose clients include online luxury fashion retail platform Farfetch, Marks &amp; Spencer, and online fashion retailer Boohoo. Other portfolio companies include UK-based SaaS platform Mercaux, Thai fashion ecommerce startup Pomelo, Indonesian lifestyle brand Brodo, and Singapore-based retail tech company Pixibo. 
 Most recently, it invested in US-based Neighborhood Goods, which is reinventing the department store experience with various community-based activities.

 Major investors in the new fund included returning limited partners such as government-backed SME Support Japan, social media company Gree, and Mizuho Financial Group members Mizuho Bank and Mizuho Capital. 
 Strive announced the first close of the fund at  US$130 million  in May 2019. At the time, it had already invested in edtech startup ClassPlus and Tokyo-based TrustDock, which provides an application programming interface for know-your-customer services. 
 Through Fund III, the firm has also co-invested with other leading VCs such as Sequoia Capital, Monk’s Hill Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners, and Accel Partners as it aims to be a cross-border Asian fund with a strong presence in India, Southeast Asia, and Japan. 
 Strive also announced it had promoted Nikhil Kapur last year to serve as a partner. Kapur has made more than a dozen investments in his last four years with the company, leading Fund III’s investments in Southeast Asia and India, the company said. 
 The firm has led seed-stage investments in companies such as Saleswhale and Hasura. It has also backed healthtech startup Medtrail and fintech company Kudo, which has since been acquired by ride-hailing giant Grab.

 As the Covid-19 outbreak rages on, it could trigger a prolonged global economic slowdown, creating a challenging environment for business. Startups need to be nimble and agile to cope with the effects of this viral disease, which  Sequoia Capital dubbed  as “the  black swan  of 2020.” 
 Covid-19 is negatively affecting eight out of 10 startup businesses, according to a recent  Tech in Asia   survey . The travel industry is the hardest hit, as the majority of businesses cancel travel plans to minimize the spread of this illness. 
 That’s certainly adding to the challenges of Indian hotel startup Oyo, which had just announced plans to  retrench  5,000 employees globally in an effort to cut costs and boost profitability. Our latest visual story tracks Oyo’s  dizzying rise  to decacorn status – a great achievement, but investors are  questioning the valuation  for the SoftBank-backed loss-making company.

 Founded in 2018, Omnichat specializes in cross-platform marketing, including tracking customer browsing behavior, providing automatic shopping guides, and retargeting, among others. 
 It also offers a customer service system that integrates with ecommerce websites, Line, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp. Omnnichat said it expects to integrate new communication platforms such as WeChat and Telegram this year. 
 It looks to use the new funds to bankroll its customer acquisition efforts in Taiwan this year and expansion into Singapore and Malaysia in 2021. 
 The company also expects to launch an affiliate program this year, inviting digital marketing-related companies, agencies, and consultants to collaborate on developing more ecommerce solutions. 
 According to Omnichat co-founder Alan Chan, the development of the US$42.7 billion ecommerce industry is already at its mature stages. “Even small ecommerce companies attach great importance to indicators such as traffic, data analysis, membership management, and marketing conversion rate,” he said. 
 The startup said it had about 3,600 new customers by the end of 2019, with over 70% of which coming from Taiwan. It has also recently worked with well-known Taiwanese ecommerce brands including HH Herbal and Toyselect.

  Mod.io CEO Scott Reismanis / Photo credit: Mod.io 
 
 Founded in 2018, Mod.io is a gaming service that aims to make user-generated content (UGC) more accessible to game developers across platforms and stores. It provides a clientless API so developers can easily create and share content and modifications (or mods). 
 The service currently supports games with a C++ software development kit and native plugins for game engines Unity and Unreal, according to a statement. 
 Mod.io plans to use the funding to support more platforms such as consoles, mobile, and virtual reality, in addition to PC. It also plans to partner with more gaming studios. 
 “Creating a constant flow of content updates is expensive and time-consuming for developers,” Scott Reismanis, CEO of Mod.io, said, adding that his company wants to make things more cost-effective. 
 The company claims it has delivered over 500,000 hours of content across 31 games in 12 months, with 100,000 daily active users and 22 million downloads. 
 UGC in games is a huge untapped opportunity, according to Harri Manninen, founding partner at Play Ventures. Roblox, a US-based gaming creation system using UGC, is now valued at  US$4 billion , according to the  Wall Street Journal . It recently raised US$150 million in a series G funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz’s late-stage venture fund. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.99941176)]",['UGC'],"['US', 'Australia']"

641430,Grab bets on convenience to boost GrabPay after changes in rewards program," Grab recently made some of the  biggest changes yet  to its GrabRewards loyalty program in Singapore. This comes after similar moves in Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. 
 These changes have proven controversial in some quarters. Dismayed users took to social media to air their grievances, while several personal finance sites gave a generally negative response, with some referring to the updates as a “devaluation.” 
 So what is it that’s got them all hot under the collar? 
 Under the new scheme, all GrabPay users will have to spend more than they did previously to get the same number of GrabRewards points. Users paying for Grab services in cash will no longer receive any points. 
 Here’s a comparison between the points tallies under the old and “revalued” GrabRewards systems (scroll table right):

 Here’s a snapshot of some of the reactions on social media: 
     
 New services, gamification 
 Grab’s defense is that while the changes means fewer points per dollar spent, it has simply reduced the multipliers on points accrual. The apparent deficit is offset by adding to the number of channels through which points can be earned. 
 A company spokesperson tells  Tech in Asia  that the changes were done “to reflect the overall growth of our ecosystem and the increased ways and places users can earn and spend their reward points.” Grab was still largely a ride-hailing service when the program was rolled out in 2016, but it has since expanded into areas like food delivery and payments, providing more opportunities to amass points, the representative says. 
 Grab has also been introducing different ways for users to gain rewards through gamification, including challenges, flash sales, and “moment-based” campaigns. 
 One example is its  Zodiac Coin Hunt , which went live in mid-January to coincide with the Lunar New Year period. The game gives users the chance to win weekly prizes of up to S$58,888, along with promos from participating merchants. According to Grab, nearly half its active users took part in the challenge. 
 GrabPay Card 
 Another more recent addition to the Grab services lineup is the GrabPay Card, a physical and virtual debit card launched in partnership with Mastercard and linked to users’ GrabPay wallets. 
 Through this card, Grab users can now spend money in their GrabPay wallet internationally, both inside and outside of Southeast Asia. The physical card can be used at close to 53 million Mastercard-accepting merchants worldwide.

 Users can also accrue GrabRewards points each time they spend on their card. This allows them “to earn GrabRewards points globally at millions of merchants, online, in-app, and offline,” according to the Grab spokesperson. 
 Removing points multipliers for cash payments altogether is designed to boost the usage of GrabPay. “We want to encourage users to adopt digital payments as a way to enhance their level of convenience as they transact on our ecosystem,” the representative says. 
 User numbers at risk? 
 As suggested by some of the more negative responses to the GrabRewards revisions, at least some users have indicated they will reduce their spending on Grab services or avoid using GrabPay altogether. 
 While Grab seems to think this doesn’t present a long-term problem, it does raise questions about the company’s ability to retain some of its customers who were initially drawn to GrabPay by the promise of rewards. 
 As with many young, high-growth, consumer-facing businesses, it initially used GrabRewards-based promos such as discount vouchers to attract users to its platform. This became particularly important for driving up the adoption of GrabPay, which is central to long-term sustainability because the service can be expanded outside of Grab’s own ecosystem. 
 It’s like a bad-tasting medicine that just has to be taken. 
 But such generous loyalty schemes are expensive for the companies that implement them, observes Zennon Kapron, director of fintech advisory firm Kapronasia. 
 With intense competition, especially on the payments side, GrabRewards “simply was not sustainable,” he tells  Tech in Asia . 
 “Although there’s no perfect time to devalue a rewards program, the best time was yesterday and the next best is today. It’s like a bad-tasting medicine that just has to be taken.” 
 How this affects customer retention remains to be seen, he adds. “The average Chinese millennial watches their rewards closely so I wouldn’t be surprised to see [Southeast Asians] shift away from Grab [and jump] to other platforms, where possible.”

 But Grab may have an advantage here: Few platforms in Southeast Asia can offer the same breadth and depth of services. While Gojek is Grab’s closest competitor, the Indonesian super app doesn’t offer rewards points outside of Indonesia. 
 What will be key is whether Grab has already reached that inflexion point of becoming an indispensable app for Southeast Asian consumers. 
 The course charted by Chinese payments apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay provides a point of comparison. “In China, there was a significant amount of friction in traditional payment methods,” Kapron explains. 
 “Using a card often meant inserting, typing a PIN, and then signing. Alipay offered a much more convenient approach to payment. Although incentives did help to get both consumers and merchants onto the Alipay platform, the convenience kept them there.” ",Jack Ellis,0,5,"[(2, 0.91438234), (3, 0.08553659)]","['app', 'fintech', 'PIN', 'Alipay', 'GrabPay', 'Mastercard', 'GrabRewards']","['Singapore', 'Asia', 'Kapronasia', 'Alipay', 'Cambodia', 'Philippines', 'Vietnam', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia', 'China']"

 “Southeast Asia is a very attractive market, with our digital users growing to 300,000 in just eight months. Our goal is to reach 10 million students in the coming years as Asia comes online by making education more affordable and accessible to them,” said Zookal co-founder and CEO Ahmed Haider. 
 The round was led by existing investors Koh Boon Hwee, a former chairman of Singapore Airlines, and Unigestion chairman Bernard Sabrier. It also included participation from Singaporean construction and property development company Wee Hur Holdings. 
 Zookal has now raised a total of A$25 million (US$16.5 million) in capital, according to a statement. 
 Aside from doubling down on Southeast Asia, the Sydney-based startup will also use the fresh funding to triple the size of its engineering team and make key management hires. It recently appointed Manuel Silva, a former director of engineering and consumer product at ecommerce firm The Iconic, as vice president of engineering. 
 Founded in 2011, Zookal started off with a focus on providing physical textbooks to capture first-year students. It has since expanded to offer book rentals, digital videos, e-textbooks, and other digital services. 
 According to Haider, Zookal is on track to reach A$35 million (US$23 million) in revenue this year, up from A$25 million (US$16.5 million) in 2019, growing at 264% compound annual growth rate. 
 The company said it has served over 750,000 users across Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Philippines over the past eight years.

 The startup plans to use the new funds to increase the capacity of its material recovery facility to about 2,000 tons per day in 2024 and develop smart city platforms for waste management, according to a statement.

 Citing data from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Waste4Change said that 69% of Indonesia’s waste goes to landfills, 23.5% is managed illegally by being burned, buried, or littered, and only 7.5% is recycled or composted. 
 To tackle this problem, the company plans to improve its waste management system on a larger scale by working with cities and districts in the country. It will develop a smart-city solution for waste management, which would cover waste issue monitoring, financing solutions for upstream-to-downstream waste management projects, and waste management socialization and education delivery. 
 Waste4Change looks to launch it this year. 
 The technology will later be developed together with Sampah Muda, a waste management startup that joined Waste4Change in January this year. 
 “We believe that technology support and active collaboration between stakeholders, such as the private sector, investors, government, and the community, are the main keys to implement Circular Economy and zero-waste Indonesia,” said Waste4Change managing director Mohamad Bijaksana Junerosano. 
 Founded in 2014, Waste4Change provides services that consist of four aspects: consult, campaign, collect, and create. These include responsible waste management consultation and education efforts, as well as responsible waste collection management and recycling services. 
 The company started off managing waste from only one office building. It has since expanded to serve almost 40 commercial areas and 2,000 homes. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(0, 0.9995714)]",[],['Indonesia']

 Founded in April last year, the startup matches migrant workers to jobs through its digital platform, with an initial focus on serving construction workers in the city-state. 
 The platform collects and analyzes data points to find jobs based on the users’ skills and experience. By sending a message to Sama on WhatsApp, they can start the sign-up process, including uploading identification documents, training certificates, and proof of prior work history. Workers will then be matched with jobs at companies that also use the platform. 
 According to a statement, the startup has obtained a license from the Ministry of Manpower earlier this year, enabling it to work directly with companies to address their hiring needs. 
 Due to various middlement and outdated processes, workers currently pay up to S$10,000 (US$7,228) in agent fees to secure a job in Singapore, according to Sama. With a team of five, the startup aims to lower these fees through technology. 
 “We see migrant workers traveling to and from construction sites in Singapore daily. They and their families are at the bottom of the pyramid,” said Melhuish. “Despite this, many pay up to nine months’ salary in commissions to middlemen to secure their jobs. Sama aims to stop this and ensure they get a fair deal.”

 Established late last year, First Digital Trust offers solutions for the delivery of digital asset custody. Legacy Trust spun out the business to help it focus more on its traditional trust and pensions businesses while giving its digital asset segment the flexibility to innovate. 
 The company recently announced plans to roll out a new rapid settlement and clearing network, which will give custodian clients the ability to transfer digital assets seamlessly across the region. It will initially be restricted to fiat and crypto assets, but can be expanded to accommodate other assets such as tokenized securities. 
 First Digital Trust plans to use the new funds to help with the launch of the new service in May. 
 In addition, the company also said it is working with Nogle to further develop its platform, which aims to bring legacy financial services to the digital asset sector and set the industry standard for custodianship of digital assets. 
 “The unique synergies between our two companies will accelerate our vision of creating a world where people can trade and transact digitized assets freely,” said First Digital Trust chief operating officer Gunnar Jaerv. 
 Based in Taiwan, Nogle aims to empower entrepreneurship through the provision and development of proprietary technology, business consultancy, funding, and human resources. Prior to being the lead investor in First Digital Trust, Nogle has backed leading tech firms such as global messenger app Telegram and Hong Kong-based fintech firm TNG.

641590,Openspace Ventures to raise $200m for third fund," Singapore-based venture capital firm  Openspace Ventures  said it’s looking to raise US$200 million for its third fund, which it quietly launched earlier this year. 
 With the new fund, the firm will continue looking for series A and B investments in Southeast Asia, Hian Goh, founding partner at Openspace Ventures, told  Tech in Asia.

 It was reported last year that the VC firm was also looking to launch a US$300 million growth opportunity fund. Goh told  DealStreetAsia , which first reported about the company’s new fund, that the firm is still in talks with its limited partners for co-investment efforts. 
 Founded in 2014, Openspace Ventures said it has more than US$225 million assets under management from a range of global and regional institutional investors. It currently has 27 portfolio companies, covering business-to-customer and business-to-business technologies in local, regional, and global markets. 
 Most recently, it co-led a  US$10 million  series B funding round for Finnomena, a Thailand-based digital wealth management platform. Its other investments include Indonesian unicorn Gojek, healthtech platform Halodoc, fintech firm FinAccel, communication SaaS firm Whispir, and health insurance company CXA Group, among others. 
 Openspace Ventures, formerly known as NSI Ventures, closed its debut fund at US$80 million. In 2018, it raised  US$135 million  for its second fund from Singapore sovereign fund Temasek and US private equity firm StepStone Group. 
 As of December 2018, Southeast Asia made up less than 1% of the US$3.6 trillion in total global private capital and venture capital assets under management (PEVC AUM), according to Preqin. But the industry is  growing , with the combined PEVC AUM in the region rising by 8.6% from US$26 billion to US$28 billion between 2017 and 2018.

641438,Asian startups in state of tension amid coronavirus pandemic: Tech in Asia survey," Asian startups are becoming increasingly worried as the Covid-19 outbreak starts to negatively affect their businesses, according to a recent  Tech in Asia  survey of over 140 industry professionals and founders. 
 About 80% of those surveyed said their businesses have been negatively influenced by the  pandemic , which Sequoia Capital described as a  black swan event  that could trigger a prolonged global economic slowdown. Three in 10 respondents said they were heavily and severely hit by the outbreak. 
   
 With more than 70% of the startups canceling business trips to minimize the spread of the virus, companies in the travel industry were the most severely affected. 
 A Singapore-based travel agency said the company had already lost more than US$20 million in potential revenue due to booking cancellations. “We acquire hotels by paying a fixed amount every month,” a company executive said. “Now, we still have to pay monthly, yet we have no bookings. We have to break contract with our hotel partners. We can’t pay them anymore.” 
   
 The spike in infections has drawn parallelisms between the new disease and SARS, with some experts suggesting that the  global economic cost  of the outbreak would be much more severe compared to the latter. 
 The potential economic fallout was amplified when the Federal Reserve recently  slashed interest rates  by 50 basis points – the biggest cut since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2008 – amid mounting concerns that the novel coronavirus outbreak would stall the record expansion of the US economy. 
 If Covid-19 continues to spread, the world may again be heading for another crisis of epic proportions. 
 With much of China in lockdown to contain the virus from further spreading, the global supply chain has been significantly disrupted. As a result, some companies (about 27% of survey respondents) are looking for alternative suppliers outside of the mainland. 
   
 Companies are right to prepare for the worst. Indeed, some are attempting to conserve as much cash by holding back expansion plans and slowing down hiring efforts. This makes sense considering that 40% of the startups  Tech in Asia  surveyed were seeing delays in fundraising activities. 
   
 It pays to be nimble and flexible during these uncertain times, when companies are already reporting losses in potential revenue. 
   
 As the situation appears to worsen every day, nations should be counting on their governments to come to the rescue. Unfortunately 68% of Asian startups do not trust their governments’ ability to manage the outbreak. 
   
 While such skepticism is understandable, it’s also not healthy. Life must go on. Eventually, things will be back to normal, and we might even see a big surge in economic activity just like what happened post-SARS.

 The new fund has already made four investments in Southeast Asia, including Indonesian digital SME lender  Koinworks , productive consumer financing startup  Julo , insurtech company  Sunday , and commerce and fintech firm Ula. 
 “Southeast Asia is the biggest strategic step-up region for this fund [Accion Quona Inclusion Fund],” Quona partner Ganesh Rengaswamy, who oversees the company’s Asia investments, told  Tech in Asia . He added that the company onboarded Dan Bertoli, previously a venture partner at Singapore-based Qualgro and chief investment officer at Telenor, in 2019 to focus on the region. 
 “In total, we will continue to be very active in Southeast Asia […],” Rengaswamy said. 
 The fund’s other investments so far include Brazil’s   Contabilizei ,  Pakistan’s  Finja , India’s  ZestMoney , South Africa’s  Lulalend , Mexico’s  Klar , Brazil’s  Kovi , and East Africa’s  Sokowatch . 
 Quona said it currently has US$363 million in assets under management following the close of Accion Quona Inclusion Fund. 
 The fund, which exceeded its US$150 million target, included commitments from entities such as global asset managers and insurance companies, investment and commercial banks, university endowments, foundations, family offices, and development finance institutions. 
 Quona got its start at Accion before becoming an independent venture firm in 2015. Since then, the company has supported more than 20 fintech companies looking to expand access for underserved consumers and small businesses.

641586,Moovaz receives series A funding from YCH Group venture arm SCAngels," 
 
 YCH Group, Singapore’s largest homegrown supply chain solutions company, announced an undisclosed series A investment by its corporate venture arm SCAngels in local logistics startup  Moovaz . The fresh funds will be put toward developing features that will simplify processes in the niche but highly lucrative global relocation industry.

 Moovaz’s platform utilizes an interactive marketplace and machine intelligence to refresh the traditionally slow, expensive, and opaque processes involving multiple intermediaries of the relocation industry. Right now, the company has a global network of more than 2,000 partners that are certified moving service providers. 
 “Moovaz has clearly disrupted an industry that, though fundamentally sound, is clearly due for rejuvenation. With their collaboration with SCAngels, they are given an advantage over their competitors in solving traditional challenges such as under-utilization of capacities and information asymmetry, which have constantly plagued the relocation industry,” said SCAngels partner and YCH Group chief investment officer, James Ong, in a statement. 
 On top of the investment, Moovaz will be able to utilize YCH’s business know-how and supply chain processes, as well as collaborate with YCH’s network of freight forwarding partners to realize operational efficiencies. SCAngels will, in turn, provide Moovaz with market access through multiple networks across Asia, mentorship with SCAngels’ industry experts, and technology and business collaborations. 
 As a co-investment partner of SCAngels, SGInnovate will also contribute to the funding, which is in tandem with Singapore’s Research, Innovation, and Enterprise 2020 Plan (RIE2020). The partners identify and co-invests in Singapore-based startups with intellectual property and global market potential in the domains of services and the digital economy, aligning with the government’s push to cultivate smart logistics in the city-state. 
 “The global mobile workforce is set to grow to 1.8 billion people, and we are changing the way professionals and families embark on their new life adventures. We are immensely pleased to have the backing and support of Singapore’s largest homegrown supply chain solutions company,” said Moovaz CEO Lee Junxian. 
 The startup previously received US$1 million in seed funding from Mojo Partners in June 2018, as well as an undisclosed amount from Hustle Fund in February 2019. Previously an offline moving service provider, Moovaz started their online service just a year ago.

 In addition to the funding, Laboratik also announced that Sou Hotta, the co-founder of Vietnamese AI product developer Cinnamon, has joined the team as vice president of engineering. Humanyze founder and MIT Media Lab visiting researcher Ben Waber was also appointed as an advisor to the startup. 
 Founded in July 2015, Laboratik develops team analytics products and services using natural language processing. It plans to use the new funds to further develop its offerings and strengthen its sales efforts in Japan and in its international markets. 
 The startup said it aims to help companies effectively manage and understand their teams, especially as workplace chat applications and remote work opportunities have become more commonplace. 
 Its flagship product, We, analyzes workplace chat interactions and automatically generates team engagement visuals, which can then be used to identify internal communication conditions and problems. The product, which is still in beta stage, has already been used in dozens of companies and by thousands of users, the company said. 
 Laboratik’s earlier service, A, is a bot that integrates with team communication tool Slack. It measures team conditions as well as quantifies the amount of each member’s chat communication and analyzes the users’ emotional tendency using NLP. 
 The company had previously raised US$800,000 in a seed round led by Archetype Ventures, according to Crunchbase. It also secured US$100,000 in an angel round in 2017 and US$200,000 in debt financing in 2016.

641436,How baby boomer investors are driving P2P lending," Baby boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, have sometimes been described as the “Lucky Generation.” 
 This group has spent the best part of their years in peaceful, economically prosperous times. In many countries, it’s a generation that has enjoyed a social security safety net and expanding personal freedoms. On top of this, they’ve managed to buy their own homes and build a degree of wealth that succeeding generations might only be able to dream of. 
 
  Photo credit: Farhan Perdana 
 
 As the youngest of this demographic moves into their senior years, the group as a whole is embracing digital technologies. These include digital-enabled services and banking products, with one of the most novel, compelling banking solutions being peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. 
 It’s worth taking a look at how this generation could be affecting and driving P2P lending, especially in markets like Oceania and Asia. 
 Enthusiastic participants 
 There’s one convincing argument that this generation could be a major driving force behind P2P lending, and that’s how this demographic has already embraced the sharing economy. Baby boomers have actively participated both as consumers and as service providers in this industry. 
 Research shows that  44% of those over 55 years old  have been making use of services such as Uber, Airbnb, and eBay to boost their income. A significant percentage said that the on-demand economy allowed them to generate income from assets and skills that they otherwise  wouldn’t have been able to profit from . 
 These avenues include selling things online, renting out a spare room, driving for a ride-sharing platform, or participating in P2P lending. As they enter retirement and work less, these platforms provide a convenient way to earn additional income. 
 Four percent of baby boomers have already made use of P2P lending platforms to  generate extra cash . The comparatively lower rate of adoption at the moment could be due to the fact that P2P platforms are newer than more established segments. 
 Indeed, newer sharing-economy services such as P2P lending and online outsourcing have been found to offer the largest relative potential for user growth. The estimated addressable market for Australia’s P2P lenders could be  around US$75 billion . 
 In New Zealand, the sector is also at a nascent stage, though with strong potential for growth. With baby boomers controlling a  significant percentage  of the country’s total disposable income spending, they could end up being major investors and consumers in the space when it does mature. 
 Similarly, Asia also has a strong demand for P2P lending, with the market  growing from  US$108 billion to US$330 billion between 2015 and 2017. 
 Malaysia and Indonesia, in particular, have experienced strong demand, but the Singaporean market has demonstrated the highest interest in the sector. Currently, the biggest players in the industry include Funding Societies, MoolahSense, Capital Match, CoAssets, Minterest, SeedIn, and Validus. 
 MoolahSense is backed by high-profile firms like East Ventures and Pix Vine Capital. Funding Societies is also active in Indonesia and Malaysia and  is backed by  Sequoia India and SoftBank Ventures Asia Corp. 
 In Hong Kong, key players include  Queen Capital, WeLend, and WeLab . WeLab, in particular,  has high-profile investors  like Li Ka-shing’s TOM Group and Sequoia Capital. China’s contracting sector remains an exception in East Asia  due to  government regulations in response to pyramid schemes. 
 Sharing economy’s appeal 
 Flexibility, convenience, and low barriers to entry could be other benefits that attract baby boomers to sharing platforms. The on-demand economy is a nondiscriminatory environment where older workers can contribute their skills, experience, and assets. They can earn extra income while working around their personal and other work commitments. 
 Additionally, with  people living longer , the need to build a larger retirement nest egg for financial security has become more important. Some people from this demographic might be embracing the sharing economy because they want to stay productive and involved in the workforce. Others might be looking to explore different investment opportunities to keep their money working for them. 
 The sector’s strengthening regulatory frameworks have engendered a higher level of trust in shared-economy platforms. As more reputable providers offer P2P services, more consumers from this generation might  be more likely  to try similar services. 
 Although the  regulatory challenges  of protecting consumers and ensuring fair competition remain, both the Australian and New Zealand governments are enhancing their regulatory frameworks in response to the rise of these disruptive platforms. 
 However, the trick is to balance this with fostering industry rather than  constraining  it as China has done, though necessarily in response to unscrupulous local operators. 
 Singapore and Thailand serve as useful case studies of  “sandboxing” frameworks . These regulatory systems allow fintech startups to experiment under government supervision, balancing liberalization with protections for consumers. This could reduce the risk of the kind of unscrupulous behavior that devastated China’s P2P lending industry. 
 Market volatility and low interest rates fueling participation 
 Although millennials dominate in terms of usage, baby boomers are the  fastest-growing earners  in the overall sharing economy. Factors such as  share market volatility  and very low interest rates and yields contribute to the need to generate extra income through alternative means. 
 Individuals from this group are making an average of US$115 a month through the sharing economy. This figure is  trending upward , suggesting that this generation’s sharing-economy earnings have the potential for significant growth in the coming years. 
 Those among this cohort are accustomed to a lifestyle that they may  find hard  to downgrade from, which might be further motivating them to seek out alternative income streams. 
 Most recently, incidents like the Covid-19 outbreak could have a compounding impact on the growth of P2P lending. With tens of millions of people confined to their homes, internet-based services  are experiencing a surge  in customers in countries like China. 
 Generally, wider trends like the explosion of fintech in Southeast Asia could further propel the P2P lending sector across the region. Similar driving factors include smart devices, AI, AR, and 5G. These technologies allow new, faster ways to offer fintech services and engage with consumers. 
 Summing up 
 Baby boomers could well be a significant driving factor behind the rise of the sharing economy and the growth of alternative financing products like P2P lending. This generation could eventually make up a large percentage of the industry as both lenders and consumers. 
 This group is likely to have the time, assets and resources, and disposable cash to continue expanding their participation in the sharing economy. Additionally, they’re motivated by enhanced regulation leading to greater certainty and trust. 
 As more people from the demographic become aware of the benefits of P2P lending, they could constitute a main driving force behind the expansion of this nontraditional lending segment. Lastly, effective regulatory systems like sandboxing can balance liberalization with needed consumer protections, especially in Asia.

641338,Commentary: Move fast and stay helpful," Dear Readers, 
 Two Indonesians have tested positive for Covid-19 this week, marking the first confirmed cases in the country. Given how critical Indonesia is to Southeast Asia’s tech community, we can expect even tougher times ahead. 
 The common advice is to stay calm and immediately make necessary changes to minimize the impact on business. As a friend who was at Alibaba during the SARS epidemic told me, “there are real opportunities even in these difficult times.” Also, the Covid-19 outbreak won’t last forever, so we need to get through this crisis the best way we can. 
 I’ll be speaking to him again soon, and I hope to share more about our conversations with you next week. 
 Spend and be helpful 
 Truth be told, I find that I’ve been spending less money lately. 
 I’m not just saving something for a rainy day – it’s also because my family and I have avoided going outdoors after Covid-19 hit. So there’s little reason and fewer opportunities to spend. 
 It seems like that’s the case for most people. Some of the mom and pop shops around my neighborhood are mostly empty, and as someone who also operates a business, I feel for them. 
 A couple of days ago, after picking up my daughter from school, my wife and I made a point to visit a nearby provision store to buy a snack. We wanted to show support with our wallet. 
 We ended up getting more than a snack. My daughter saw a  flock of toy ducks and wanted it, so we bought it too. 
 
  “Duck-duck.” 
 
 It turned out to be a pretty good purchase. My daughter’s been having fun playing with her rubber duckies when she showers. My wife and I have explained to her that there’s a nasty virus going around. She seemed to understand and took the initiative to clean the ducks, too. 
 The conversation went something like this: 
 Me: “Eh, do you remember the virus? Duck-duck was outside for a long time, so what should you do?” 
 Daughter: “I clean duck-duck. I want bubbles (she means soap) – I clean daddy, too!” 😂 
 Of course, I’m not encouraging you to spend blindly just to show support – you can do other things to offer encouragement. You can buy what you need and from time to time give your loved ones a little treat as well. A small boost can go a long way. 
 Moving fast is also one way to be helpful. We’d love to hear from you about how  Tech in Asia  can improve and serve you better. It will mean a lot to us if you can  fill out this user survey . 🙏 
 Thank you and see you next week!

 The probes were to find out if the Starbucks rival had fabricated its operational and financial figures, including per-store per-day sales, net selling price per item, and advertising expenses, according to a  TechNode  report. 
 The development comes after US-based investment firm Muddy Waters Research recently  tweeted  that it received an anonymous 89-page report alleging that Luckin was reporting fraudulent figures. For instance, the report claims that the startup inflated its number of items per-store per-day by at least 69% in the third quarter of 2019 and 88% in the quarter that followed. 
 As a result, Luckin’s share price fell 10.74% to roughly US$32.49 per share on January 31. However, it bounced back in February as its shares soared 21.8%, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. 
 Luckin denied the allegations in February, calling the report misleading, flawed, and without merit. “Luckin Coffee firmly stands by its business model and is confident in benefiting from the strong growth of China’s coffee market in the future,” it said. 
 At the end of last year, Luckin claimed to be the largest coffee chain in China with 4,507 stores. In comparison, Starbucks has about 4,300 outlets in the country. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(1, 0.99948233)]",['Starbucks'],"['US', 'China']"

The round also saw investors Unitus Ventures and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation making a partial exit, according to a statement. 
 The Bengaluru-based startup said it will use the new funds to further develop its AI conversation intelligence platform and expand across Asia Pacific and North America.

 Salesken, which started commercial operations in 2019, uses machine learning and data science tools to learn industry best practices and sales tactics used by top-performing salespeople. 
 Sales teams using the platform receive intelligence on various aspects of the sales pitch, including lead qualification and pricing discussions. The technology also helps them gauge the sentiments of their customers during conversations. 
 Inside sales, which employs over 20 million people globally, is a rapidly growing industry worldwide with nearly 48% of all sales teams now selling products over the phone or web conferencing tools, according to Salesken. 
 “Companies squander a third of their customer acquisition costs on preventable lead losses. They also face the unpredictability of sales outcomes and an inability to replicate success at scale,” said Surga Thilakan, co-founder and CEO at Salesken. “Salesken.ai helps them by enabling sales teams in real time, during their customer conversations, and in adopting a more scientific approach to sales management.” 
 The global conversational AI market is expected to grow to  US$15.7 billion  by 2024 from US$4.2 billion in 2019, with a compound annual growth rate of 30.2%, according to a report. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.99950796)]","['Salesken', 'AI', 'Bengaluru']",['AI']
641388,Monk’s Hill closes second Southeast Asia fund at $100m," Singapore-based VC firm  Monk’s Hill Ventures  has closed its second Southeast Asia fund at US$100 million to focus on series A opportunities in the region.

 The company said in a LinkedIn post that it welcomed an expanded base of limited partners for Fund II, bringing in a group of global and diverse investors such as US-based endowments and foundations, sovereign funds, insurance companies, corporates, and family offices. 
 Temasek, which is an LP in the company’s first fund, is also a main investor in the second fund, according to  Venture Capital Journal , which first reported about the development. It’s also looking to launch a separate opportunity fund. 
 Kuo-Yi Lim and Peng T. Ong, the managing partners of Fund I, will continue to lead the new fund. 
 Monk’s Hill plans to continue investing in founders aiming to address sizable market opportunities in tech, specifically at the early stage. “We focus on investing in founders with a plan to scale up profitably in major economies including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines,” a spokesperson for Monk’s Hill told  Tech in Asia.  
 Monk’s Hill also said it has already deployed some of Fund II’s capital, investing in Indonesian business-to-business restaurant supply marketplace Stoqo, Singapore-based talent recruitment and career discovery platform Glints, and project collaboration app Padlet. 
 The company said it did not have a target size for the fund, but set a hard cap of US$150 million in a 2018 SEC filing. 
 In comparison, Monk’s Hill raised  US$80 million  for its first Southeast Asia fund, which invested between US$1 million and US$3 million into series A and B startups in the region, as well as in Silicon Valley. It previously injected funds into logistics provider Ninja Van, on-demand warehouse service provider Waresix, and English learning app ELSA. 
 “Today, our Fund I portfolio companies are performing strongly with healthy revenues and margins,” the company said. Monk’s Hill has backed over 20 startups to date.

641395,Sequoia warns startups of ‘turbulence’ as coronavirus outbreak persists," Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital urged its portfolio companies to brace for the negative business impact of Covid-19, which it dubs “the black swan of 2020.” 
 “We know the stress you are under and are here to help,” the company wrote Friday in a  letter  addressed to Sequoia founders and CEOs. “In the interim, we should brace ourselves for turbulence and have a prepared mindset for the scenarios that may play out.”

 As of this writing, there are over 98,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 globally and more than 3,300 deaths. 
 Sequoia said that many companies are facing challenges amid the outbreak, including a sharp decline in business activity. “Some companies have seen their growth rates drop sharply between December [2019] and February [2020]. Several companies that were on track are now at risk of missing their Q1 2020 plans as the effects of the virus ripple wider,” Sequoia said. 
 The lockdown in China has also affected the global supply chain. “Hardware, direct-to-consumer, and retailing companies may need to find alternative suppliers,” Sequoia suggests. Software businesses, however, while less exposed to supply chain disruptions, remain at risk, according to the company. 
 Sequoia said companies are also suffering from meeting cancellations as a result of travel bans in some international locations and firms discouraging non-essential travels. 
 The VC firm has backed tech giants like Airbnb and Apple. Just this week, Airbnb said it could  push back  its IPO plans in 2020 in light of the virus outbreak. Apple, meanwhile, is reportedly facing a  shortage  in stock of replacement iPhones. 
 Sequoia said that it will take time, “perhaps several quarters,” before the virus is completely contained. “It will take even longer for the global economy to recover its footing,” it added. 
 The firm said companies should consider every assumption about their business, including runway, fundraising, sales forecasts, marketing, team headcount, and capital spending. 
 “Nobody ever regrets making fast and decisive adjustments to changing circumstances,” Sequoia said as it shared a lesson from experiencing economic downturns in its 50 years of operation. 
 It also suggests that leadership in business plays an important role during difficult times. “A distinctive feature of enduring companies is the way their leaders react to moments like these.” 
 “As Darwin surmised, those who survive ‘are not the strongest or the most intelligent, but the most adaptable to change’,” the company said. ",Doris Yu,1,2,"[(0, 0.2462935), (1, 0.010282901), (2, 0.74333346)]","['Apple', 'VC']","['Airbnb', 'Apple', 'China']"
641362,Edtech firm Byju’s keeps India focus as revenue growth triples," Amid the slow deflation of the global startup bubble, a little-known edtech company seems to be defying all odds on its way to decacorn status. 
 Think and Learn, the owner and operator of learning app Byju’s, expects the platform’s revenue to reach about US$200 million for the year to March this year. That’s more than a three-fold jump from the about US$64 million revenue it earned a year earlier, chief operating officer Mrinal Mohit tells  Tech in Asia . 
 
   Byju Raveendran, the founder &amp; CEO of Byju’s.  
 
 If those claims look a little tall, imagine this: Byju’s expects its revenue to double to about US$400 million by March 2021. 
 Mohit says increasing demand for tech-based educational aids in India is boosting Byju’s growth. “Every year, we realize that the segment is much bigger than what we thought before,” he says. 
 There are some 500 million people in India aged between 5 and 24 years old,  according  to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF) – a government think tank. “This provides a great opportunity for the education sector,” it says in its industry report. 
 India is now the second-largest market for e-learning after the US, IBEF reports. The e-learning segment is expected to reach over US$1.9 billion by 2021, with around 9.5 million users. 
 The profit mantra 
 Byju’s has set a blistering pace of revenue growth, and its operating margins are at about 30%, Mohit says. That’s an enviable number for most global startups that are struggling to turn profitable. Margins are high due to the low cost of production relative to the scale, says Mohit. 
 The pivot toward profitability for tech startups came in the wake of the WeWork fiasco, when the co-working startup pulled its initial public offering after struggling to sell shares at a reported valuation of US$10 billion. 
 In 2019, total funding for technology startups dropped by 22% from a year earlier,  according  to research by startup accelerator HexGn. Asia “bore the brunt” with investments down 47%, and deals down 27%, it said. 
 But education tech companies are defying this trend. 
 About one-third of edtech companies attracted venture capital funding in 2019, with 1,019 firms  raising  US$14 billion cumulatively, according to research firm RS Components. Byju leads the pack. 
 
   Source: RS Components  
 
 In February, the 15-year old company was  valued  at about US$8.2 billion, following a fresh US$200 million funding by private equity firm General Atlantic in its series F round. 
 Handling the pressure 
 Byju’s content is strong enough for the company to not cut corners despite a lofty valuation, says Mohit. Other startups have been in the news of late due to dodgy practices used to clock aggressive growth. 
 Unlike legacy educational institutions using rote learning, Byju uses online visual aids to explain fundamental concepts in science and math, the COO says. 
 Given its four-year head start, Byju’s has a strong content pipeline. “Byju’s had literally no competition [at the time],” says Mohit. 
 
   Mrinal Mohit, Chief Operating Officer, Byju’s. Source: Byju’s  
 
 It also helped that the initial 300 content producers who joined the company were mostly former students. The team was also focused on the product instead of raising venture capital, says Mohit. 
 “At the end of the class, if I can solve a geometry question, that is what matters to me,” he shares. 
 The company’s flagship product, its learning app for grades four to 12, has over 42 million registered users of which 3 million buy annual subscriptions, the company claims. A student spends an average 71 minutes on the app, it says. 
 Compelling content 
 The company’s founder, Byju Raveendran, had previously worked as an engineer in a Singapore shipping company. On his trips back home to India, he would coach friends who were taking the notoriously difficult entrance exam to the Indian Institute of Management. 
 As word spread, Raveendran started teaching more students, often with as many as 800 pupils at a time. On one such occasion, Raveendran was teaching a group of students in a hotel’s banquet hall. 
 The sheer rush of people to the hotel prompted Ranjan Pai, a partner with Aarin Capital, to inquire with the hotel staff what the fuss was all about. 
 “Where is the math teacher?” asked Pai. He was surprised to realize that there was no teacher but just a video playing on a large screen, recounts Mohit. 
 Pai decided to invest in the company to help it scale, Mohit says. Aarin Capital invested US$9 million at the time. Pai did not respond to  Tech in Asia ’s request for comment. 
 People always pay you upfront. 
 Unlike other startups, Byju’s wants to remain focused on its core target audience, Mohit says. 
 It will double down on the K-12 segment, Mohit says. Even with a projected revenue of about US$400 million in 2021, Byju’s would have only tapped less than 2% of the addressable market, he says. 
 And it helps to be profitable too. Byju’s is India’s only profitable unicorn. “In education it is easy,” Mohit says. “People always pay you upfront.” 
 On top of this, the team’s middle-class values mean Byju’s has been penny-pinching in spending the money raised, says Mohit. While declining to share numbers, he says the firm has used only a fraction of the amount. 
 In January of 2019, Byju’s acquired US-based Osmo, a maker of educational games, for about US$120 million. It was founded in 2013 by ex-Google engineers Pramod Sharma and Jerome Scholler. The acquisition will help Byju’s develop a mobile app that will allow students to scan questions and get answers via the platform, says Mohit. Moving forward, acquisitions will be selective and rare, he says. 
 Byju’s will expand its medium of instruction from English to seven major Indian languages, says Mohit. That will help it dominate and scale in its home market of India. 
 In 2020, the firm will also concentrate on becoming a primary source of learning instead of mainly being an education aid. “This year, the vision is to become an at-home learning company rather than just a learning app,” Mohit says. Byju’s will also introduce solutions allowing students to ask questions on the platform, he says. 
 According to the firm, it won’t be expanding into high-growth and emerging markets such as Southeast Asia and Africa at least for a year. “We don’t want to spread ourselves too thin,” Mohit says.

641418,SoftBank becomes largest backer of Beike in $2.4b series D+," 
 
 Real estate platform  Beike  has secured over US$2.4 billion in its series D+ financing round, which was closed in November 2019, the company  confirmed  with local media  Tencent News  on Wednesday. Having poured in US$1 billion, SoftBank became the largest backer in this round. 
 Other participants include Tencent, Hillhouse Capital, and Sequoia Capital.

 The fresh funding will be used for tech research and development, product innovation, and talent recruitment, said the firm. Beike will have a valuation of US$14 billion after this round. 
 Beike was founded in April 2018 after real estate brokerage Lianjia, already dominant in large cities such as Beijing, refocused and rebranded its online business to connect property agents and property seekers across the country. Prior to this round, Beike had closed a US$1.2 billion series D financing round in July 2019, in which Tencent injected US$800 million, according to a  36Kr  report. 
 As of December 2019, Beike had expanded to 106 Chinese cities, counting more than 235 real estate brands, 38,000 brick-and-mortar brokerages, and 360,000 brokers on its platform. 
 The company was reportedly aiming for an initial public offering in Hong Kong this year, targeting a value of US$20 billion to US$30 billion. 
 China’s real estate market has seen an upsurge in sales in recent years. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that sales of residential properties have grown to  13.94 trillion yuan  (US$2.01 trillion), up 10.3% year on year, double the sales figure of  6.24 trillion yuan  in 2014. 
 With an eye on the online Chinese real estate market, SoftBank also invested another US$1 billion via its Vision Fund into Chinese apartment rental platform Ziroom, also an offshoot of Lianjia. The Vision Fund directly injected US$500 million and bought an additional US$500 million shares from Ziroom founders,  The Wall Street Journal  reported. 
 These two investments came at a time when Softbank’s Vision Fund has been criticized for a series of recent investment missteps. It has previously injected US$2 billion to US office-sharing company WeWork in January 2019, which failed its IPO in September and had to be bailed out with a US$9.5 billion rescue package. Another portfolio company, Indian hospitality giant Oyo, will reportedly have a massive layoff of over 5,000 employees globally. 
 SoftBank posted an operating loss of US$2.1 billion from its US$100 billion Vision Fund for the three months ended December 2019.

641361,"Patamar Capital raising second fund as it looks into lending, SME enablers in Indonesia"," Patamar Capital, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm that focuses on emerging markets in Asia, is in the midst of raising its second fund even as the spread of Covid-19 has slowed fundraising across the region’s tech startup space, says the firm’s Jakarta-based partner Dondi Hananto. 
 The firm is confident it will raise US$150 million by the end of this year (though progress has been  affected by the virus ). Its first fund of US$45 million was launched back in 2014 and has been fully deployed. The same is true for its more recent US$3 million “mini-fund” focused on female founders.

 Patamar has a portfolio of 20 startups across India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. These companies include fintech startup Mapan (acquired by Gojek in 2017), fintech lender Dana Cita, and Indonesian ecommerce platform Sayurbox. 
 While the firm remains focused on these four main markets, its investment strategy has somewhat evolved since the first fund, Hananto says. For Indonesia in particular, Patamar is eyeing opportunities in online lending as well as small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) enablers. 
 Online lending and SME enablers 
 With the Indonesian payments space dominated by market leaders Ovo and GoPay, Hananto believes the opportunities are in lending, including lending that specializes in specific niches. Such companies are already present in Patamar’s current portfolio – Dana Cita is a fintech lender that focuses on student loans, while Kinara Capital provides loans to micro and small enterprises. 
 “There are many multifinance companies in Indonesia – big ones as well – that focus solely on car and motorcycle loans,” Hananto says. “I believe the new lending fintech startups can also be quite specific [but also] grow big or [become] scalable enough to be in that specific sector.” 
 Insurance is of interest to the company as well, including those that protect small-ticket items. One example, Hananto mentioned, is Grab’s recent partnership with Indonesian  insurtech firm Qoala , which lets Grab drivers insure their mobile phones – an important productive resource. 
 Such insurance products can be sold through online channels, Hananto says, while bigger-ticket items – whether it is vehicle or life insurance – would still need to be sold face-to-face through agents. “We learned a lot from Aldi [Haryopratomo] on how the company grew their network of agents,” he says, referring to the co-founder of Mapan. 
 Credit risk 
 While Patamar remains bullish on fintech, Hananto says it’s been a challenge to assess the risk for microloans. 
 In underbanked markets such as Indonesia, verifying borrower data is a challenge due to a lack of credit scoring for many consumers. While, the amount of alternative data to verify creditworthiness – such as mobile phone activities, ecommerce transactions, and the like – have started to proliferate and are being used by many of the country’s online lenders, Hananto says such data still isn’t sufficient to predict a borrower’s behavior. 
 “The only way to create this is to get people to start borrowing [then] basically your credit model will improve over time,” he says. “We’ll just need to see who can survive until we have a real, working, proper, and robust credit model.”

 Patamar is also keen on investing in service providers and  tech enablers  for SMEs in line with its mandate to help address the needs of such businesses as well as low- and middle-income consumers. 
 For instance, the firm is interested in companies that provide automation solutions to help make SMEs’ supply chain management systems more efficient and boost productivity. Such solutions would be key to companies like Sayurbox. Since a bulk of its operations are still handled manually, the team easily gets overwhelmed when receiving hundreds of orders a day. 
 “I really like how Jack Ma articulates this,” Hananto says. “First, you help SMEs to sell because that’s exactly what they need. Once that develops, then you help them become more efficient.” ",Putra Muskita,0,3,"[(3, 0.99979436)]","['Gojek', 'Hananto', 'fintech', 'SME']","['Sayurbox', 'Qoala', 'Asia', 'Patamar', 'India', 'Hananto', 'Philippines', 'GoPay', 'Vietnam', 'Mapan', 'Indonesia', 'Jakarta']"
641396,Paktor cuts jobs as two key markets slump; sees bright spot in voice dating app," Paktor, a Singapore-headquartered startup running a slew of dating apps and an offline dating agency, has conducted multiple layoffs since 2018, three sources familiar with the company tell  Tech in Asia . They also said that the startup has made more cuts this year. 
 The company’s headcount has fallen from about 250 to 190 between 2018 and 2019, according to ex-staff familiar with the numbers, even as it saw strong growth in Goodnight, its voice-focused dating app. 
 Paktor’s CEO Shn Juay says that the startup now has around 200 employees. It makes job cuts every year as part of regular operational reviews, she adds. 
 
  Photo credit: Paktor. 
 
 She admits that Paktor has been “more aggressive this year in terms of the resizing.” It will shed 5% of its workforce by the end of Q1. 
 “We want to centralize some of our resources in Taiwan, such as marketing and technology,” Juay explains. 
 Another reason for the cuts is how Covid-19 has dampened business in two of its core markets, Hong Kong and South Korea. In Hong Kong, the political protests also made an impact, the CEO adds. 
 A third of Paktor’s revenue comes from its offline dating agency, which organizes large-scale events for singles and matches them for one-to-one dates. 
 These business lines have been hit as the environment made it challenging for people to go on dates or gather in large crowds. All Paktor-run events have also been canceled in the past two months, Juay says. 
 “We’d book restaurants for couples meeting for the first time. And they’ll arrive, only to find that the restaurant had been closed for the day or the week,” she adds. 
 Cost-cutting moves 
 Since 2018, the company has been tightening belts to extend its financial runway: some benefits had been reduced and the regular layoffs made some employees tense. 
 “People tended to be edgy,” says an ex-employee. “When we did a quarterly town hall where it’s said that the company’s not doing well, people will start to worry if they’re next to go.” 
 Its cash flow situation improved in the second half of 2019 where it was almost breaking even every month, the person adds. Juay says that Paktor was cash flow-positive in 2019 and most of 2018. 
 But the company’s cash flow appears to have taken another hit this year, another source tells  Tech in Asia . 
 Juay declines to comment when asked about the company’s cash flow and whether it’ll will be able to meet payroll and liability obligations. She did say that she’s not expecting more cuts after March. The startup is also looking to hire in Taiwan, although plans have not been finalized.

 Meanwhile, Joseph Phua, the CEO of Paktor’s parent firm M17 Entertainment, isn’t worried about the subsidiary’s cash flow. 
 “The last time I had to worry about Paktor was three years ago,” he says, referring to the dating app startup’s merger with M17 in 2016. That was the last time he looked at its financials. 
 Phua explains that the group does not keep cash at the subsidiary level. This means M17 regularly withdraws and consolidates money from its 16 subsidiaries. Money is then injected downstream as needed. 
 This means that it’s difficult for any employee within Paktor to have a true view of its cash flow just by looking at its financial statement. 
 “I’ve not received a request for cash disbursement from any of our subsidiaries,” he says. 
 Online entertainment soars 
 Following a botched attempt on the New York Stock Exchange, Phua has been shaping M17 up for a second run at a listing. 
 Sources tell  Tech in Asia  that M17 held advanced talks to sell Paktor to other dating app firms last year. No deal materialized as Phua didn’t get the valuation he wanted. Paktor did not attempt to raise more capital on its own, Juay confirms. 
  See:  M17’s ill-fated IPO: CEO reveals all   
 Phua adds: “Paktor is the only regional dating play […] Global players have not been able to penetrate these markets fully and hence, Paktor is extremely attractive.” 
 A person familiar with the talks says that almost every single dating group in the world has made an offer. 
 A bright spot is  GoodNight , an app that starts voice conversations between strangers. 
   
 It ranks fifth in the dating category on Google Play in five countries, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. 
 Overall, Phua says that Paktor makes up a small part of M17, which focuses on livestreaming. While its offline elements have been affected by Covid-19, traffic to its entertainment apps has spiked as more people are passing the time while confined at home. 
 “For the last six weeks, we’ve had record numbers every day,” he says.

 Founded in 2016, the fintech company says it focuses on digital-first engagement with customers, data-driven methods, customer experience, and financial fitness. It offers services not only with resolving its customers’ accounts but also accessing resources that empower their financial fitness. 
 The new funds will allow the company to support the needs of its large clients and expand overseas, starting with the UK, InDebted co-founder and CEO Josh Foreman told  SmartCompany . 
 Foreman said the company has seen its revenue grow 300% in the past 12 months and its valuation increase 18x since its seed round. It secured A$1 million (US$659,000) in a seed round from Reinventure in 2017. 
 InDebted, which has served over 250,000 customers to date, has more than 60 employees across its three offices in Sydney, Manila, and London. 
 The latest funding round brings its total capital raised to A$17 million (US$11.2 million). 
 The debt collection software market is projected to reach  US$5.7 billion , growing at a compound annual growth rate of 9.4% from 2019 to 2026, according to a report.

 The company will use the new funds to expand its network of experts in Asia, invest further in its team, and accelerate the development of its own expert data platform. It will also enhance its business development and sales functions to drive both regional and global growth and exposure, as well as optimize its client-expert matching system. 
 The startup provides research consulting services, delivering insights into regions and industries through various formats, depending on the client’s need. Other services include expert interviews by telephone or face-to-face, online surveys, short-term expert staffing, as well as market reports and local tours. 
 “The sharing economy has become a widely accepted concept with the sharing of tangible assets such as cars and houses becoming mainstream in the last decade. Arches is building a platform that shares people’s intangible assets, namely ‘knowledge,’ across countries,” said Hiroki Kato, CEO of Arches. 
 The company seeks to address the lack of industry information, which businesses that are looking to expand into other markets need. According to Arches, these types of information belonged only to “a small group of insiders” and that public data are “extremely limited.” 
 The firm currently has clients in Japan, Asia, Europe, and the US.

 The startup provides revenue management and distribution solutions to independent hotels, and is currently working with over 2,000 hotel partners across eight markets in Asia Pacific. 
 It has grown threefold since the beginning of last year. The company had also expanded its operations to Australia, Malaysia, and Thailand in 2019. 
 “We enjoyed a strong year, and our performance validates our approach. We believe in focusing on the right things, delivering meaningful value for our hotel partners, and growing responsibly,” Zuzu Hospitality co-founder Vikram Malhi said in a statement. 
 To smoothen the process of penetrating the Vietnamese market, the company has appointed Ho Vu Phuong Chi and Nhung Nguyen as the new head of sales and country manager, respectively, of its Vietnam operations. Ho and Nhung will be immediately tasked with acquiring independent hotel partners in Ho Chi Minh City, Danang, and Hanoi. 
 “Between our recent hires and the staff that have been with us since the beginning, we have now assembled a strong team of leaders. We’re confident their skills and experience will continue to fuel our growth in the region,” added Malhi. 
 With the Covid-19 crisis severely impacting tourism throughout the world, 2020 is widely expected to be a challenging year for the hospitality industry. Independent hotels, which are unable to diversify their online pipelines are among those at greatest risk. More than ever, it is vital for hoteliers to become discoverable on platforms such as online travel agencies. 
 In light of this global crisis, the hotel industry has taken a hit, and it will take new approaches, channels, and attention to mitigate the situation. Zuzu Hospitality helps these small players by equipping them with the latest technologies and skilled resources. 
 “Our data-driven online revenue management and distribution services are even more necessary, valuable, and urgent during this period, as they can help independent hotels access new channels of demand to mitigate the losses of current travelers,” said Dan Lynn, Zuzu Hospitality’s co-founder.

 Aside from manufacturing smart glasses, Mad Gaze, which was established in 2013, also offers various solutions that include an app-based online marketplace, an automatic AR app generator, a developer platform, and a remote solution platform. 
 The startup said it plans to funnel the fresh investment into research and development for new smart glasses, optical technology, and AR technology. It also looks to venture into smart watches and expand into new markets. To date, Mad Gaze has launched seven AR glasses. 
 While it focused on producing products for business use in the past, the company said it designed its latest offering, Glow, specifically for the consumer market. 
 “With simply plugging into the smartphone, [Glow] streams the mobile screen onto the glasses. It is more personal and easily integrated with consumers’ everyday life,” said Mad Gaze CEO Jordan Cheng. 
 According to a 2018 Digi-Capital report, Chinese investments into computer vision and AR technologies increased to US$3.9 billion during the year. At the same time, VC sentiment on virtual reality softened significantly, the report noted. 
 Another company in the space is Sky Limit Entertainment, a tech company that aims to create immersive entertainment and cultural experiences in China.

 Founded in 2019, Singapore-headquartered ESPL creates mobile ecosystems for amateur esports leagues globally. It uses a franchise model, which allows esports players to participate in global tournaments. Aside from mobile esports, it also features PC and console-based video games on its content network. 
 The company will use the fresh capital to roll out ESPL-branded tournaments and platforms to 10 countries in its first year of operation. During the roll-out’s initial phase, it aims to set a global footprint across 16 countries in Asia, Europe, and the US. 
 According to ESPL, it will collaborate with one tournament partner in each country, operating under a hybrid model of on-ground and online tournaments. 
 The first ESPL season is set to run from April to November 2020, according to the company. It will also announce additional key international partnerships soon. 
 ESPL has so far sealed partnerships in Southeast Asia and Latin America, according to the statement. It has entered its first media partnership with eGG Network, an esports TV network with a presence in Southeast Asia and Australia with about 100 million TV viewers. 
 “Esports is poised to surpass traditional sports. Research suggests that the global esports audience is expected to reach 645 million in 2020, surpassing baseball, rugby, and American football,” said Khailee Ng, managing partner at 500 Startups. 
 The number of investments in the esports industry  doubled  to 68 in 2018 from 34 in 2017, according to Deloitte. With an 837% year-over-year growth rate, investments reached US$4.5 billion in 2018 from just US$490 million the year before.

640883,Oyo’s precarious rise from $1b to $10b in valuation,"    ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
  Oyo was pretty obscure in the first four years of its life, but SoftBank’s involvement changed all that.  
 Within two years, the Indian hospitality startup grew into a unicorn. In another two years, it became a decacorn. 
 Its eye-popping valuation, however,  could land Oyo in hot water . 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
 Oyo’s latest round, valuing it at US$10 billion, was unusual because its founder, Ritesh Agarwal, was borrowing as much as US$700 million to buy back shares in his company. 
 The round was also being negotiated even as WeWork’s problems were surfacing and before Oyo’s own troubles emerged. 
 With its losses widening in tandem with revenue, Oyo will need to prove that its business model is workable, let alone justify its hefty valuation. 
 Doing so won’t be easy. Even as Oyo eyes a global conquest, homegrown competitors may win local battles and force it to retreat. 
 Perhaps being a regional giant isn’t so bad, after all.

 The startup also concurrently announced its new direct-to-consumer offering through its strategic investment into fitness apparel company  Lyft .

 Owned by athlete and entrepreneur Edward Kato, Lyft produces and sells branded merchandise online. Together with the brand, AnyMind will be launching a service for social media influencers and content creators to produce and market their own line of products. 
 The company will use the new funds to scale its D2C business and move into new markets such as India and the Middle East. It also looks to extend its digital out-of-home advertising services – currently available in Thailand through VGI AnyMind Technology – into Japan and the rest of Asia. 
 According to AnyMind CEO and co-founder Kosuke Sogo, the collaboration with Lyft falls in line with its strategy of leveraging its connections with marketers and influencers across Asia to provide value and growth for both sides of the ecosystem. 
 Previously known as AdAsia Holdings, AnyMind has three business units: AdAsia for advertising, CastingAsia for influencer marketing, and TalentMind for human resources. 
 In March last year, it closed its series B funding round at  US$21.4 million  after receiving investment from VGI Global Media and Japanese financial services company Tokyo Century. It also  raised capital  for the same round from messaging app Line and Mirai Creation Fund back in October 2018. It has secured a total of US$62.3 million of capital to date. 
 Recently, AnyMind agreed to  acquire  Japan-based influencer network  Grove  in a deal that saw the Singaporean company taking 91,600 shares of Grove at 51% ownership.

 “Our first focus of 2020 is growth with profitability,” Ritesh Agarwal, founder and CEO at Oyo, was quoted as saying in the report. Agarwal also said that the company is focusing on improved corporate governance and relationships with hotels. 
 According to the chief exec, the company’s global headcount will be slashed by 17% from 30,000 staff in January. “By the time our restructuring process is complete, Oyo will have over 25,000 employees worldwide.” 
 Oyo intends to cut half of its 6,000 direct full-time staff in China amid the novel coronavirus outbreak, according to sources. “In China, the coronavirus has hit us, and in specific provinces, we are trying hard to keep hotels open – as many as possible,” said Agarwal. “It’s a tough time for our hotel partners.” 
 The development comes after the startup reportedly asked some 600 of its employees in China and about 1,200 staff in India to leave earlier this year. 
 Last year, the company’s valuation was estimated to reach  US$10 billion , after securing US$1.5 billion from SoftBank and RA Hospitality. However, according to a report, the downturn of Oyo’s Chinese business, which is influenced by the Covid-19 disease, may hurt its valuation to fall to about  US$6 billion . 
 Oyo reported  widening losses  at US$335 million for the financial year ended in March 2019 from US$52 million a year earlier. Revenue, meanwhile, grew a little more than four and a half times to US$951 million. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(2, 0.9995)]","['Oyo', 'SoftBank']","['US', 'India', 'China']"
640949,A low-key $300m company plans to disrupt Indonesia’s supply chain ‘mafia’," Bizzy Group has had a busy few years behind the scenes. 
 The Jakarta-based startup was established in 2015 as an e-procurement platform. 
 Andrew Mawikere became its CEO two years later and brought on a key investor: Sinar Mas Digital Ventures, the venture capital arm of one of Indonesia’s largest conglomerates, Sinar Mas Group. 
 That relationship deepened in 2018 after an unusual move. Bizzy merged with Sinar Mas companies that are larger and older – a logistics firm founded in 1992 and a distribution company that was set up the following year. 
 Bizzy Group was born.

 The company has the lofty ambition of simplifying Indonesia’s unruly logistics network. With Mawikere at the helm, it sought to unify all parts of the supply chain, from ports to warehouses to distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. 
 These puzzle pieces would be linked through an open digital platform that would allow any manufacturer to deliver goods to any part of the country. 
 
  How Bizzy shortens the supply chain / Image credit: Tech in Asia 
 
 The group, which is valued at a combined US$300 million, made US$290 million in sales last year. Bizzy Digital is the startup that’s building the platform sitting atop the established distribution (nearing profit) and logistics (now profitable) arms. The digital unit is raising US$9 million and is close to securing a lead investor for the round. 
 Getting into shape 
 The journey leading up to the fundraising had been rough. Bizzy had to merge a team of startup yuppies with blue-collar workers that form the bulk of the organization. 
 “The drivers, warehouse workers, salesmen – you cannot govern them through OKRs (objective and key results),” says Mawikere, referring to a goal-setting system that’s popular among tech companies. 
 And while digital workers prize flexible work arrangements, blue-collar workers value structure. “They have to be in the warehouse by a certain time, and they have to leave by a certain time,” he adds.

 Next, Bizzy had to trim the fat. The company found itself biting off more than it could chew as it chased big goals. 
 “A lot of it is inspired by Alibaba,” says Glenn Lai, Bizzy’s vice president of digital distribution and logistics. While the Chinese tech titan had the capability to do it all at once, Bizzy needed to pick its spots. 
 The startup ended up putting more resources into the distribution business because it was showing the most promise. 
 I had to suck it up and do it. 
 The move drew fire: A finite budget meant that while some departments grew, others had to shrink. Plans were postponed, and this pissed off some employees. 
 “People had a whole dream of what they will contribute to for five years,” recounts Lai. “Suddenly, the entire plan got shifted down for an entire year.” 
 This process was painful for Mawikere, too. He decided to shut down the e-procurement platform – an idea that he believed in but wasn’t working out. 
 “I had to suck it up and do it. I had to be away for two weeks just to clear my head,” he recalls. 
 In total, 300 people were let go in the exercise, leaving the company with a headcount of 2,700. 
 “It was painful for us, but we came out on the other side a lot more focused,” adds Lai. 
 Breaking the wholesale mafia 
 Indonesia is a unique market for logistics. The country’s large geography, population, and under-developed infrastructure has created a supply chain that could go seven layers deep. 
 Distributors work with sub-distributors. Sometimes, agents come between buyers and sellers.  Warungs  – or roadside stores – sit at the far end of the chain. 
 Because  warungs  change locations often and deal mostly in cash, specialized wholesalers exist to sell goods to them. 
 Some players, however, are parasitic. Lai points to a “mafia-like network of wholesalers” who are bullying buyers into accepting inflated prices. 
 Solving  warung  owners’ pain points will make an impact. After all, traditional retail accounts for 83% of retail sales in Indonesia, according to a research report by investment firm CLSA. 
   
 Among some big fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, ecommerce accounts for under 5% of their sales, CLSA believes. This explains why online marketplaces like Bukalapak, Tokopedia, and Blibli are partnering with  warungs  to offset the low adoption of ecommerce, which is caused by the country’s  inadequate infrastructure .

 Meanwhile, modern retailers are facing heat from ecommerce players. Their growth has stalled, and convenience store chain Alfamart’s net shop additions have dropped to historical lows, CLSA notes. 
 Supermarkets are struggling too as Indonesians tend not to buy in bulk, says Lai. That consumer habit, coupled with underdeveloped infrastructure, makes it hard for them to scale up. 
 The government, after encountering pressure from traditional shop owners, has enacted  regulations  to impose limits on retail chains. 
 This is all good news for  warung  owners, who will likely continue to play a big role in the average Indonesian’s life. 
 By combining its distribution network with a series of tools that make managing the supply chain easier, Bizzy is helping  warung  owners to earn a better living. 
 Bizzy has relationships with brands and owns 200 trucks and 27 warehouses across Indonesia. It doesn’t need to build up its distribution network from scratch, unlike competitor Warung Pintar. 
 Its software platforms include: 
 
 
 Fieldforce:  A tool for managing and monitoring salespeople 
 
 Tokosmart:  An app that lets retailers purchase directly from Bizzy and other distributors 
 
 Bizzy POS:  An inventory management system for retailers 
 
 Over 20,000 retailers are already buying from Tokosmart at least once a month, with an additional 10,000 doing so every other month. 
 
  Bizzy’s components / Image credit: Bizzy 
 
 Sellers on Tokosmart are earning a 19% growth in sales on average compared to before they joined the platform. Meanwhile, retailers on Warung Pintar have also seen their margins improve, according to CLSA’s research. 
 That’s because store owners on a digital network can place orders anytime instead of waiting for a salesperson to arrive. Sellers can also discover new items on the app. 
 “Whenever I go to restaurants [in Indonesia], half the menu items are out of stock,” says Lai. Tokosmart can reduce lost income by helping sellers replenish items quicker. 
 Uncovering hidden logistics fleets 
 Indonesia’s supply chain has another quirk: Its logistics cost is about  a quarter  of its entire gross domestic product, which is  higher  than its Southeast Asian neighbors. This speaks to both the opportunity and inefficiency in the space. 
 In 2018, the country ranked 46th in the world in terms of logistics efficiency, behind Southeast Asia’s main markets except the Philippines, according to the  World Bank .

 Finally, about 90% of the world’s logistics fleets are privately owned. As such, they’re only accessible to their owners, unlike the DHLs of the world. This trend is acute in Indonesia, which has a  higher percentage  of private fleets than the global average. 
 Bizzy Digital envisions that Truckway, its fleet and route management and optimization software, will make these private fleets accessible. 
 Lai says these fleets are underused as they tend to be overloaded for a few days and completely idle on others. The plan is to open up Truckway to any distributor or manufacturer – sort of an Uber for delivery trucks. 
 Long way to go 
 Of course, Bizzy Digital is new, so it’s far from where it needs to be. It’s eating its own dogfood by testing out its software internally. It’s slowly opening them up to third parties. 
 Bizzy’s penetration of traditional stores is only a drop in the ocean compared to the country’s estimated total of 3.5 million to 5 million  warungs . 
  See:  What’s driving the revival of Southeast Asia’s B2B ecommerce   
 Many  warung  owners continue to resist technology, with some fearing that they’d have to pay taxes after coming on board. 
 Lai, however, says the increase in sales for each owner will far outweigh the taxes, which is pegged at  1% for businesses  with a gross turnover of below US$340,000 a year. The average  warung  doesn’t make anywhere near that much.

 On the payments front, about 95% of retailers on Bizzy’s network pay for goods in cash, but that’s because the platform had only started adding digital payments a couple of months ago. 
 Bizzy can persuade up to 30% of them to adopt digital payments by this year, Lai believes. That number could go up to 50% in a few years. 
 The company also faces the sheer complexity of managing three business units and four digital product lines – along with the numerous competitors within each category to deal with. 
 We’re thinking at least three to four steps ahead. 
 But Bizzy is not thinking too far ahead. 
 Yes, it has plans: Its distribution arm is diversifying beyond FMCG. It’s finding ways to help  warungs  earn more, such as aggregating and selling their shelf space to brands as well as allowing them to sell digital goods (which competitors are already doing). 
 But the supposed benefit of Bizzy is that it combines the nimbleness of a startup with the resources of a corporation. 
 “We’re thinking at least three to four steps ahead, rather than 20 steps ahead,” says Lai.

641131,Why did Grab buy a robo-advisor few people know about?," Taken at face value, Grab’s acquisition of  Bento Invest  last month made plenty of sense. By bringing the robo-advisor into the fold, the super app could further its ambition of padding out its financial services offering – not only to bring affordable wealth management products to it users, but also to support its bid for a digital banking license in Singapore. 
 But the deal also came with a number of unanswered questions: Why did Grab opt for Singapore-based Bento, a relatively unknown player, in a world seemingly awash with higher profile robo-advisory startups with their own user bases and better brand recognition? 
 ‘Most suitable partner’ 
 Grab didn’t disclose financial details of  the acquisition . A filing with Singapore’s Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority indicates that Bento – now known as GrabInvest – and its holding company have combined paid-up share capital of S$6 million (US$4.31 million). 
 Bento co-founder and former CEO Chandrima Das has joined Grab as its head of wealth management and is responsible for GrabInvest. She will be reporting to Philip Chew, head of investment and new businesses within Grab Financial Group, which is headed by senior managing director Reuben Lai. The robo-advisor’s 11 other employees have made the move to Grab as well. 
 Lai tells  Tech in Asia  that Grab saw Bento as the “most suitable partner” in the robo-advisor space due to its proprietary tech and experience in digital wealth and asset management.

 Bento may not have as much brand recognition as firms like  StashAway ,  Autowealth , or  Kristal.AI , but it has been an active player in the Singapore robo-advisor market since launching in October 2016. 
 This inconspicuousness is perhaps explained by the fact that it has mainly sold white-label solutions to financial services providers, while its smaller business-to-consumer operations have focused on managing assets for high-net-worth individuals, charities, and endowments. 
 “Bento’s clients represent some of the largest financial institutions in the region, and we are excited to welcome them to the Grab family,” Lai says, without naming any of those clients. 
 Such an “out-of-the-box” solution may have proven more attractive to Grab from the perspective of getting a wealth management service to market as quickly as possible. It may also have come at a more attractive price point than some of the better-known robo brands out there. 
 The fact that millions of… payments are already going through the platform gives Grab a significant edge in attracting funds. 
 Ultimately, Grab may have seen the acquisition mainly as a means to acquire the necessary regulatory clearance, as quickly and affordably as possible. 
 To sell wealth management products to retail consumers, Grab needed to attain a capital markets service license under the Retail Licensed Fund Management Company (retail LFMC) category from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). 
 Such rules require retail LFMCs to have a minimum base capital of S$500,000 (US$359,000), as well as “financial resources which are in excess of its total risk requirements,” a minimum of three full-time Singapore-based employees with at least five years’ experience, and a CEO with at least 10 years’ experience. 
 Lai says that Grab “received the license with the acquisition of Bento,” indicating that the onboarding of the Bento team is what enabled GrabInvest to meet these MAS requirements. 
 Alipay playbook 
 GrabInvest is set to go live on the Grab app in the first half of 2020 in Singapore, with expansion in other markets to follow. 
 Although Grab has done significant work in building out its Grab Financial portfolio, wealth management has remained a product gap, says Zennon Kapron, director of fintech advisory firm Kapronasia. 
  Yu’ebao  – the money market fund that China’s Alipay made available to its users in 2013 and which was, until this year, the world’s  largest such fund  – gives an indication of Grab’s future plans. Similar mobile-first, easy-to-access, and low-risk investment options could likewise prove a big success in Southeast Asia, Kapron tells  Tech in Asia .

 Grab is likely to “capture more consumer wallet share,” he says. “The wealth management offering, on its own, might not be enough to bring new users to the Grab platform, but it should help to better monetize those that are already on there.” 
 In Singapore, consumers already have a variety of wealth management options to choose from. In addition to consumer-facing robo-advisory startups, legacy banks have also been busy adding automated investment features – such as DBS’s  DigiPortfolio  and OCBC’s  RoboInvest . 
 Lai isn’t able to disclose what GrabInvest will cost to consumers at this stage. “What we can say is that in Singapore, we will not be charging some fees which the mass retail market typically has to pay – such as entry and exit loads, performance fees, and so on,” he says. 
 Digibank push 
 Another backdrop to the Bento deal is Grab’s pending application for a digital bank license under Singapore’s nascent virtual banking system. 
 Last year, Grab revealed it was  forming a consortium  with telecom giant Singtel to apply for a full license under the scheme. It’ll be one of 21 groups  competing for the licenses . 
 To be successful, applicants will have to demonstrate that they can build a viable, profitable business over the long term. That’s going to be a tough ask for Grab – which has yet to turn a profit overall – to do on its own. 
 
  Tech companies like Grab and Singtel will be going up against traditional incumbents in the race for digital banking licenses in Singapore. / Photo credit: 123RF 
 
 In Singapore’s mature banking marketplace, basic deposit and checking services won’t cut it. Given this, products – such as insurance and investment – that digibanks can tack on to their core offerings are likely to be key to sustainability. That means more M&amp;As are on the horizon, says Frank Troise, Asia-Pacific CEO at fintech consultancy SenaHill Partners. 
 “All of the digibank applicants need a wealth proposition ASAP,” Troise tells  Tech in Asia . “It’s the only clear offering that gets them to accomplish the profitability requirement of the MAS. Grab and Singtel are now first, and we expect the other digibank applicants to do the same very shortly.” 
 The ace up Grab’s sleeve is its massive user base, with its app installed on millions of mobile devices across Southeast Asia. Partnering with Singtel – the biggest phone carrier in Singapore which has associates in Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines – is only likely to compound that user-base advantage. 
 “The fact that millions of individuals are using the platform every month and that payments are already going through the platform gives [GrabInvest] a significant edge in attracting funds,” Kapron says.

641192,Sea increases 2019 adjusted revenue threefold to $2.9b," Southeast Asian internet giant  Sea  has posted total adjusted revenue for full year 2019 at US$2.9 billion, nearly tripling the US$1 billion it recorded during the same period in 2018.

 The result was mainly driven by its digital entertainment unit Garena, which raked in US$1.8 billion for 2019. That represents a 167.4% increase from the US$661 million it posted in 2018. 
 The gaming unit also recently hit a record 60 million daily active users and 354.7 million quarterly active users. Citing data from App Annie, Sea said that its self-developed game  Free Fire  was the highest-grossing mobile game in Latin America and in Southeast Asia in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2019. 
 Shopee, on the other hand, recorded US$942.1 million during the reported financial year, up 224.1% from 2018’s US$290.7 million. Sea said that in Indonesia, year-on-year growth for Shopee’s GMV and orders accelerated each quarter last year, ultimately registering over 188 million orders for the market in the fourth quarter. 
 Meanwhile, Sea’s net loss widened to roughly US$1.45 billion for 2019, increasing 51.7% from US$961 million a year ago. The cost of service for its ecommerce unit and other related services accounted for most of the loss, taking up US$907.5 million. Its digital entertainment segment took up US$436 million. 
 Looking ahead, Sea expects Garena’s 2020 adjusted revenue to fall somewhere between US$1.9 billion and US$2 billion, and around US$1.7 billion to US$1.8 billion for Shopee. 
 In addition to Garena and Shopee, Sea also operates SeaMoney, its digital financial business that offers e-wallet services, payment processing, credit-related digital financial offerings, and other financial products. 
 Throughout 2019, Sea said that it has been working on further integrating SeaMoney with its Shopee platform across different markets. In January 2020, over 30% of Shopee gross orders in Indonesia were paid using the payment arm’s e-wallet, said the company. Quarterly paying users for the e-wallet services have also exceeded 8 million in Q4 2019.

641052,3 tips for establishing a remote working culture in your company," There’s been a surge of interest in remote work in recent years, thanks to the increasing number of benefits associated with the practice and the widespread availability of technology. 
 “With cloud technologies and collaborative solutions made more available, we’re seeing companies embrace remote working,” explains Joey Lim, commercial lead of Asia Pacific for  Lark , a collaboration and communication platform headquartered in Singapore. 
 Lim also cites co-working spaces as a contributor to the trend. 
 Pros and cons of remote work 
 Flexible working arrangements have been found to  increase productivity and make employees happier . But despite the benefits, some more traditional businesses are still hesitant to implement such policies due to the challenges they pose. 
 By working out of the office, employees may feel isolated from their colleagues and face difficulties in developing relationships with each other. This is a significant issue, especially for younger staff who may require more guidance, according to Lim.

 Additionally, many remote workers find themselves unable to unplug, suffering from  poor work-life balance  as a result. On the other hand, managers also  worry  about being unable to manage employees who are out of sight and fear that business processes might slow down because of ineffective communication. 
 However, the pros seem to outweigh the cons. 
 Aside from  boosting productivity , remote work also helps companies  save thousands of dollars , by cutting down on absenteeism and office operating costs. 
 It also appeals to potential employees. According to Lim,  recent research  has found that flexible work arrangements are a key factor for job-seeking millennials. 
 Overall, the practice goes a long way in  increasing employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention  – a good incentive for businesses to begin looking into the approach. 
 But there’s more to implementing these policies than just announcing that employees are free to work wherever they want. Here are Lim’s three tips on how businesses can create a culture of remote working. 
 1. Change the way you understand performance 
 Before flexible working arrangements can be effective, companies need to change the way they understand key performance indicators and productivity. 
 “It always starts at the top by having managers not penalize colleagues who are working remotely,” Lim explains. “Do not account for the actual physical hours of work because the work outcome will speak for itself.” 
 Businesses need to  shift away from looking at time spent in the office  as an indicator of effort and focus on measuring employees’ performance by their results. 
 “Give them the benefit of the doubt that when you give them the right tools with the right outcome, objectives, and support, they will achieve it without being physically in the office,” Lim says. 
 For example,  payment platform Stripe formalized its flexible work processes  in 2019, opening a remote engineering hub that allows staff to work from anywhere in the world. 
 This marked a shift from the belief that physical, in-person collaboration was necessary for product development and led to greater satisfaction with the output of the firm’s engineers. 
 2. Invest in technology 
 The internet is the biggest enabler of remote work, allowing employees to perform their roles from almost anywhere in the world, as long as they have a broadband connection. 
 Many businesses leverage new technologies in order to get things done. Tools like Lark provide an all-in-one platform for businesses to streamline their processes. 
 Integrated advertising agency Dentsu X, which uses Lark’s services, particularly benefits from the platform’s document collaboration tools when making pitches for clients. The platform allows staff to edit respective sections within the same deck and track different versions of documents with ease. 
 The agency also used Lark’s video conferencing services and calendars in order to communicate effectively with clients and team members, regardless of distance. 
 This enabled Dentsu X to decrease turnaround time on projects, allowing its staff to work more effectively. 
 3. Create processes to support the policy 
 Anyone who has worked remotely has likely been on chaotic video conference calls, where people talk over each other and get distracted by something off-screen. 
 In order for these video conferences to be effective, Lim suggests implementing simple rules like muting when not speaking, waiting one’s turn to chime in, and not multitasking while on the call. This allows teams to function as if they were speaking face to face. 
 Businesses also need to communicate clearly to their employees what results they expect to see so that workers know what they have to do, says Lim. 
 Enterprises with remote working arrangements in place should also consider making the extra effort to establish a cohesive company culture by holding annual retreats that bring employees from different locations together so they can get to know each other outside of the workplace. 
 Remote working the future

 The number of remote workers is on the rise, having  more than doubled in the last decade . In a climate where business outcomes have become more important, having flexible work arrangements is vital for companies to attract and retain employees. 
 Ultimately, creating a culture of remote working relies on one simple thing. 
 “Trust your people,” says Lim.

641023,"Pay-later startup Hoolah banks 8-figure investment from Genting Ventures, others","  Hoolah , a buy-now-pay-later startup based in Singapore, has raised an “eight-figure” sum in its series A funding round led by investment firm Allectus Capital. 
 Singapore-based venture capital firm iGlobe Partners was a returning investor to the round. Other investors also include Genting Ventures, the investment arm of resort and casino operator Genting Group, former Lazada CEO Max Bittner as well as FNZ Asia Pacific CEO Tim Neville. 
 The startup’s latest fundraise follows its  expansion into Malaysia  – its first overseas market – last month.

 The company will focus on building out its omnichannel capabilities to open up an app-based installment payment option to physical retail shoppers, co-founders Stuart Thornton and Arvin Singh told  Tech in Asia . The startup will also be hiring across sales, marketing, and technology roles as it expands the service in Malaysia. 
 “A lot of our merchants in our portfolio already have businesses focusing on the Malaysian market and so for us, that was a natural progression,” says Thornton. “The total retail market there is significant as well,” he says, adding that Malaysia’s population is six times larger than Singapore and its ecommerce market is growing 20% year on year. 
 Pay-later companies typically offer consumers interest-free installment plans that break up payments for high-purchase items into smaller, more affordable sums. Firms like Melbourne-based  Afterpay  and San Francisco’s  Affirm  have been a hit among aspirational millenials in developed markets, who value the quality that comes with higher-end products but may not always have the capacity to shell out big amounts upfront. 
 Hoolah offers a three-month installment plan and charges a late payment fee that’s capped at S$30 (US$21.50). Before approving a transaction, it conducts an instant credit check on customers based on data points obtained from merchants and customers. Unlike consumer lending companies, no cash is exchanged between the pay-later company and the consumer. 
 It’s a three-way win: customers pay only a fraction of the original price upfront. Retailers receive payments in full upon a successful order and benefit from better sales conversions and lower rates of cart abandonment. Hoolah earns a fee off the transaction. 
 “The real value, from a merchant perspective, is being able to increase the number of transactions that their consumers make with them,” Thornton says. “They get the money back in their pocket very quickly. Then they can move on to managing the next customer and selling the next product.” 
 The startup claims to have increased average transaction values by up to 50% and conversion rates for merchants by 35% on average. 
 Hoolah works with more than 300 merchants, including online furniture store  HipVan , wireless speakers retailer  Sonos , and skincare brand  Skin Inc . It says its platform is being used by “tens of thousands” of users. 
 While its merchant pool is currently focused on consumer verticals such as fashion and accessories, electronics, and furniture, Hoolah plans to expand into the travel and leisure segment in the future. That makes its tie-up with Genting Group a strategic one. 
 “The business model and its target audience is potentially great for our own business, and we look forward to forming a strong partnership and contributing to Hoolah’s future growth,” Genting Ventures said in a statement.

641168,Overseas students-focused lending platform Leap raises $5.5m in Sequoia-led round,"  Leap Finance , a fintech platform for overseas Indian students, announced it has raised US$5.5 million in a round led by Sequoia India. 
 InCred founder and CEO Bhupinder Singh and Cred chief exec Kunal Shah were also among the leading angels that participated in the round, according to a statement.

 Acting as a neobank for international students, Leap creates modern financial products and services designed specifically for Indian learners. The startup said its technology takes several alternative and derived data points into account to determine a borrower’s future income potential, then gives a loan offer in less than 10 minutes based on the results. 
 Its first product is a graduate student loan that can offer interest rates as low as 8% and full study cost coverage without requiring collateral. Leap said it is currently accepting applications from students pursuing graduate studies in the US in the upcoming fall season this year, looking to finance 1,000 students. 
 According to the statement, there has been a growing trend of students from emerging markets pursuing specialized education in more developed countries. Last year, about 5 million students pursued higher education opportunities outside their home countries, spending US$150 billion annually. 
 Vaibhav Singh, co-founder of Leap, said that while Indian students make up roughly 25% of a class in a number of graduate programs in the US, the loans available to them have much higher interest rates than their American peers. 
 “This disparity stems from systemic inefficiencies and lack of innovation. We have innovated on multiple dimensions – technology, financial structuring, and risk – to bring down the interest rate and improve customer experience,“ he added. 
 Singh established Leap in 2019 alongside fellow Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur graduate Arnav Kumar, who between them have worked for companies such as InCred, CapitalFloat, Zoomo, and SAIF Partners. 
 Currently operating with a 25-member strong team, Leap said it is currently in an aggressive hiring phase, looking to fill technology positions in Bangalore and capital markets roles in San Francisco. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(2, 0.99966246)]","['Leap', 'Cred', 'fintech']","['Bangalore', 'US']"
641115,Fintech firm Oriente secures $20m to bolster services in the Philippines," Hong Kong-based fintech firm  Oriente  announced it has secured US$20 million in debt funding from local multiasset investment company Silverhorn Group.

 The lending company plans to use the facility, which can increase to up to US$50 million, to grow its loan book. It will also enable Oriente to extend the reach of its digital credit and pay-later solutions in the Philippines through Cashalo, its fintech platform in the archipelago. 
 In less than 18 months, the Cashalo app has grown its user base to over 2.5 million customers after being downloaded more than 6.5 million times, Oriente said. The company also claims that the app has grown over 20% month on month since its launch. 
 According to data from professional services network KPMG and the World Bank, only 33% of Southeast Asian small- and medium-sized enterprises have access to loans or lines of credit. Research by the Asian Development Bank estimates that addressing this gap could increase gross domestic product by 9% to 14% in the region and generate more than US$380 billion in annual banking revenues globally. 
 “As we enter the next stage of growth on our mission to helping ignite economic opportunity for tens of millions of consumers and microenterprises, the support we receive from our debt partners is critical,” said Oriente co-founder Geoffrey Prentice. 
 Prentice, co-founder and former chief strategy officer at Skype, established Oriente in 2017 alongside BlackPine Private Equity founder Lawrence Chu and Oriente CEO Hubert Tai, former founding chief technology officer for financial assets trading platform LU.com, 
 Using technologies such as AI, machine learning, and data science, Oriente builds solutions that provide real-time credit scoring as well as digital and online-to-offline lending services across Southeast Asia. 
 Apart from Cashalo, the company also operates Indonesian peer-to-peer lending firm  Finmas , which recently secured a  business license  from the country’s Financial Services Authority to operate as a fintech lending platform.

  Grab Ventures Velocity  (GVV) has returned this year with its third cohort, inviting more post-seed Southeast Asian startups to accelerate through access to  Grab ’s ecosystem.

 GVV is the scale-up program for startups from  Grab Ventures , the startup’s investment and venture building arm. The latter was launched in 2018 with a vision to build and nurture the next generation of tech leaders in Southeast Asia. 
 The big theme of GVV Batch 3 is “enabling micro-entrepreneurs.” It has two tracks: First, GVV is looking for startups that can give value-added services and solutions for food small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to help grow their businesses by reducing costs or simplifying operations. Second, Grab is targeting startups that disrupt the logistics industry with innovations in the warehousing and trucking spaces. 
 One common problem faced by SMEs is the lack of resources to speed up daily operations and boost business growth, which is why GVV wants to find startups that can help them tackle such challenges. “SMEs need to manage their businesses more effectively in order to achieve better profits. This has encouraged us to choose supply chain logistics and business management solutions for restaurant owners to be our main focus for GVV Batch 3, which is also in line with the government’s efforts to advance SMEs,” said Grab Indonesia managing director Neneng Goenadi, at a press event in Jakarta today. 
 Coinciding with the launch of GVV Batch 3, Grab Ventures also signed a strategic memorandum of understanding with BRI Ventures to create new joint initiatives, aiming to further support the development of Indonesia’s startup community. 
 In a recent interview with  KrAsia , Chris Yeo, head of Grab Ventures said that Grab is looking for startups that have a clear business model and path to profitability. The startups should also be relevant and benefit Grab’s customer base, passengers, and drivers, as well as SMEs from its GrabFood and GrabPay ecosystems. 
 GVV has worked with 15 companies from its previous two batches, including Indonesian agritech startup TaniHub and insurtech platform Qoala. Registration for the third batch is now open, and as part of the program, selected startups will go through a series of mentoring sessions led by industry experts and they will also able to test their pilot product in the Grab platform and access its large customer base.

641155,WeChat targets Bytedance’s collaboration app Feishu in latest restriction," Tencent’s super app WeChat has blocked external links on its platform from  Bytedance’s enterprise communication and collaboration platform Feishu , also known as Lark overseas, according to an announcement released Saturday by Feishu on news aggregator Toutiao.

 Feishu said that on the afternoon of February 28 it received several complaints from users saying they could not open links shared on WeChat to Feishu’s app or website. When clicking on the links, users would get a message reading, “The URL contains content which redirects users to share and follow inappropriately and has been reported by many people. In order to maintain a healthy internet environment, it’s inaccessible.” 
 Additionally, when users try to share Feishu content on WeChat – e.g. a contact QR code or video conference – WeChat would show a message that says, “The app is blocked from being shared. Unable to share on WeChat.” 
 According to local media outlet  TMT , citing a WeChat insider familiar with this matter, the super app banned Feishu’s links since the latter are  against the external link sharing regulations of WeChat . Tencent has not released an official statement in response. 
 Feishu says it has contacted WeChat for an explanation, without success. The office platform added that after the request, WeChat’s warning message has been updated to say: “If you need to access, please copy the URL into your browser.” 
 This is not the first time WeChat has allegedly blocked content from companies that can be considered competitors. Other apps that have seen content or links blocked include Bytedance’s Douyin, Duoshan, and Xigua Video, Alibaba’s Taobao, and Pinduoduo. 
 Last October, WeChat released a rigorous policy regulating incentive sharing and external links in a move to “ improve users’ experience and protect users’ privacy .” Under this policy, links to products from group discount platform Pinduoduo, third-party service providers, or links directing to download other apps, are barred from being shared. 
 The actions culminated in a lawsuit against Tencent by lawyer Zhang Zhengxin in December, who accused the social media giant of abusing its market-dominant position. The Beijing Intelligence Property Court did not immediately announce its ruling after a four-hour trial. 
 The dispute between Tencent and Zhang arose in April 2019, after Zhang tried and failed to share links from two Tencent rivals, ecommerce site Taobao and short-video app Douyin, via the WeChat messaging app. The two platforms are currently still banned by WeChat.

641122,AI medtech startup Tricog nets $10.5m in series B round,"  Tricog , an AI-driven healthcare analytics firm based in India, announced that it has raised US$10.5 million in a series B funding round from the University of Tokyo Edge Capital, Aflac Ventures, Dream Incubator, and US-based TeamFund. 
 Existing investors Inventus Capital and Blume Ventures also participated in the round.

 The round comes two years after Tricog’s  series A  raise, bringing the startup’s total funding to US$17.5 million. 
 The company plans to use the latest investment to strengthen its AI-powered platform for faster diagnosis, expand its product line for remote patient monitoring, and establish a strong presence in Africa and Asia, particularly in India, Japan, and China. 
 Founded in 2015, Tricog provides virtual cardiology services to remote clinics. Its InstaECG product helps diagnose and manage patients with critical cardiac diseases. It has been deployed in over 2,500 cath labs, hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centers, according to a statement. 
 The company recently launched InstaEcho, a platform for remote echocardiography focusing on using AI to enable point-of-care cardiac ultrasound for diagnosing heart failure and valvular heart disease and screening for congenital heart disease. It is also awaiting the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration for its DeepRhythm platform, which is designed for real-time patient monitoring. 
 “Tricog’s solution in low-resource settings is a game-changer by allowing not only instant ECG and echo readings without a cardiologist present, but also the ability to immediately detect life-threatening situations such as heart attacks, allowing appropriate care to be administered in a timely manner,” said Yousuf Mazhar, partner at TeamFund. 
 Recently, Singapore-based Eko.ai, a similar player in the space, also secured  US$4 million  in funding from Sequoia India and Singapore government-linked EDBI as it seeks to democratize echocardiography. It said it will use the funds to accelerate commercial operations in the US and Europe.

 Founded in 2004, Nulab’s products include online project management and bug tracking software Backlog, cloud-based diagramming software Cacoo, and chat app Typetalk. In 2018, it launched its first community space, NuSpace, where startups and developers can come together to work on digital projects, attend tech events, enroll in seminars, and get questions answered about Nulab apps. 
 The company said that the products are used by more than 4 million people in over 190 countries. Fukuoka-based Nulab currently has offices in New York, Amsterdam, Singapore, Tokyo, and Kyoto. 
 It will use the new funds to add more features and integrations to its products, hire more developers for its North American and European offices, boost its international marketing efforts, and develop its new security product, Nulab Pass, which will be released in summer this year. 
 Nulab is also preparing to implement single sign-on for all its software so that its users can sign in to multiple apps with just one ID and password. 
 The company raised  US$887,000  from East Ventures in 2017 in its first funding round. 
 According to industry data, working from home and remote locations has grown  159%  since 2005 across the globe, more than 11x faster than the rest of the workforce. As of 2019, only 32% of Japanese companies have flexible working policies, yet 80% of employees in the country expressed the desire to work remotely.

 The latest funding brings InnoVen’s total investment in Bounce to US$12 million. It is the venture debt fund’s third investment in the Bengaluru-based company over the last 18 months. It also closely follows Bounce’s  US$105 million  series D round led by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin’s B Capital Group and Accel earlier this year. 
 According to a statement, the mobility startup plans to use the new funds to more deeply integrate electric vehicles (EVs) to its platform, bankroll its multicity expansion plans, and accelerate profitability. The company previously said that advancing the adoption of EVs will help it push toward sustainable mobility and assist in reducing costs per kilometer. 
 Bounce will also use part of the funds for a platform play so it can more easily tailor its solution to new markets it enters. 
 “As we expand to more cities and towns, we will transition to a diverse shared mobility platform to enable various mobility options as per specific needs of each customer,” said Bounce co-founder and CEO Vivekananda Hallekere. 
 Since being founded in 2014, the startup has expanded its fleet to over 23,000 vehicles, clocking in upwards of 130,000 rides a day. It currently operates a dockless scooter rental model in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, providing consumers with a micromobility solution for first- and last-mile travel. 
 To date, the company has raised a total of about US$200 million, according to a statement. After its series D raise, media reports estimated Bounce’s valuation to be around US$520 million. 
 Other investors in the startup include Chiratae Ventures, Falcon Edge, Maverick Ventures, Omidyar Network India, Qualcomm Ventures, and Sequoia Capital India.

 As part of the collaboration, the two companies will also work towards enhancing virtual cards, B2B payments, new payments, cybersecurity, and credit scoring services. 
 For example, Digiasia will integrate its core solutions with Mastercard’s Kionect, a platform that connects small stores, including street stalls, with wholesalers to enhance payment flows. It targets to serve approximately 250,000 merchants in the first year of the product’s launch, the companies said. 
 The payments giant will also provide capital and strategic assistance to Digiasia as the latter looks to expand its payments, lending, and remittance services in Indonesia. 
 “Financial inclusion is about more than just having people transact money via apps or make online purchases,” said Safdar Khan, the division president of Southeast Asia Emerging Markets at Mastercard. “It’s about finding simple mechanisms that broaden economic opportunities so that people at all levels of society can enjoy the benefits of a modernizing digital economy.” 
 The Jakarta-based company, founded in 2017, is currently affiliated with several fintech companies in Indonesia, including e-wallet and payment platform KasPro, peer-to-peer lending and financing service KreditPro, and remittance firm RemitPro. 
 According to the statement, the investment comes at a time when the Indonesian government is focused on driving financial inclusion in the archipelago. The digitalization of commerce in Indonesia could help to add an additional US$150 billion to the country’s gross domestic product by 2025, according to McKinsey &amp; Company.

640999,Commentary: A Grab-Gojek merger makes sense but isn’t the smartest play," Many would agree that merging ride-hailing giants Grab and Gojek would make business sense. But that’s easier said than done and probably not the smartest move for both. 
 Speculation about a potential merger mounted after  The Information  recently reported that the Southeast Asian rivals are in discussions about a potential merger. In January,  Tech in Asia  published an opinion piece on  why the combination makes sense . The ride-hailing giants, however, didn’t confirm the merger talks, with Gojek saying that the report wasn’t accurate. 
 The merger could definitely create synergies, deriving cost savings and helping the combined entity become profitable. Nevertheless, the companies have no option but to  deny such reports  right now, given that any public admission would invite scrutiny from the regulators and business partners as well as the media and the public.

 Duopoly stronger than a monopoly 
 Sometimes, it’s good to have large visible competitors because monopolies are usually kept in check by regulators that have mandates to protect consumers from companies that overprice their products and services. People  tend to hate monopolies , but they generally tolerate duopolies or markets dominated by just a few companies. Duopolies are actually great business positions to be in, perhaps even better than monopolies because they attract less regulatory scrutiny or public outrage. 
 Microsoft, for example, should probably be grateful to Apple for bringing competition in the PC market all these years. Google can thank Apple as well for having iOS as an alternative to Android. Without competition, these companies would be under much harsher government scrutiny and would be much more restricted in their businesses. While surely Apple takes some customers away from Microsoft and Google, competition hasn’t prevented these companies from enjoying phenomenal growth and becoming trillion-dollar businesses.

 Tech vs. traditional companies 
 How can a tech duopoly be so successful? Because the real competition for tech companies is the traditional economy. For instance, ride-hailing is up against car ownership and taxi services, while e-commerce goes head-to-head with offline commerce. 
 As such, tech firms enjoy most of their long-term growth by migrating users of old technologies to their new technologies. Innovation replaces low-tech industries as the digital economy takes its share from the traditional businesses. 
 Expanding tech penetration versus traditional products is by far the largest growth opportunity for tech businesses, and there remains massive upside for digital economy penetration in Southeast Asia. 
 For example, while the number of ride-hailing users in Southeast Asia soared from 8 million active users in 2015 to 40 million in 2019, these consumers represented just 6% of the region’s population, according to  a recent report  from Google, Bain &amp; Company, and Temasek. 
   
  Sources: Bain, Google, and Temasek report, Zero One  
 Grab and Gojek can both enjoy many multiples of revenue growth simply by converting more people to ride-hailing instead of trying to acquire each other’s existing customers. 
 As shown in the chart below, the gross merchandise volume (GMV) of ride-hailing in Southeast Asia is expected to grow by 21% per year through 2025, driven by new users discovering its benefits as well as increasing usage by existing customers. There’s plenty of growth that Grab and Gojek can share without unnerving regulators about a potential monopoly. 
   
  Sources: Bain, Google, and Temasek report, Zero One  
 For all its growth in recent years, the entire internet economy of Southeast Asia represents just a tiny sliver of the region’s total economy. 
 As shown below, the total internet economy’s GMV was just 3.5% of gross domestic product in 2019 and is only expected to account for 8.5% of GDP by 2025 despite growth prospects. This underscores how converting the traditional economy remains the biggest growth opportunity, and to overly focus on other tech companies as the primary competition is to miss the bigger picture. 
   
  Sources: Bain, Google, and Temasek report, Zero One  
 An opportunity not to be missed 
 It’s better for Gojek and Grab to continue as separate companies, especially if they want to realize their digital bank and fintech ambitions. Regulators would be far more restrictive if a combined Grab-Gojek entity were to become a digital bank and could even try and dismantle their super-app status due to monopoly concerns. 
 It’s hard to overstate how large the digital banking opportunity is for Grab and Gojek. As individual companies, both can migrate traditional bank clients into digital customers and easily share the revenue pie because most financial services have very low digital penetration rates. Their main digital banking competition is traditional banks, not each other. 
   
  Sources: Bain, Google, and Temasek report, Zero One  
 A merged Grab-Gojek would be too obvious as the only game in town for digital banking, not just because of their ride-hailing dominance but also because of their respective shareholder bases. Uber is no longer a rival in Southeast Asia since it’s now a shareholder in Grab. China’s Didi also holds a stake in Grab, so it’s unlikely to become a future competitor in the region. 
 In fact, if you put together the shareholders of Grab and Gojek into one entity, then it reads as a near-complete list of anyone who could in theory compete with the two in the future. This possibility is unlikely to be missed by regulators. 
   
 As shown above, a Grab-Gojek merger means that most of Asia’s major tech players will team up under one entity. The only hope for competition against this combination would be US tech firms (except Uber) expanding into the region, but they probably wouldn’t try to go head-to-head, given the formidable shareholder support they’d be up against. The merged shareholder base could create the risk that regulators will step in and prevent Grab-Gojek from developing the super app that each company wants to build on its own. 
 Phenomenal growth 
 While it’s common knowledge that Grab and Gojek have spent a lot of money fighting each other, let’s not forget that both startups have enjoyed phenomenal growth. As shown in the charts below, the companies’ valuations have skyrocketed despite their market rivalry.

 Cement duopoly status 
 So what’s the smarter play for Grab and Gojek? Instead of joining forces, they should cement their duopoly status in Southeast Asia via multiple smaller acquisitions. As separate companies, they can use their highly valued shares as currency to snap up smaller but successful tech startups – ones that are less likely to trigger monopoly concerns from the government or the public. For example, Gojek could acquire other major Indonesian startups such as Tokopedia or Bukalapak. 
 Both companies can also acquire up-and-coming fintechs or maybe even buy out some small banks to help bolster their fintech ambitions. 
 Gojek could ensure that it dominates in Indonesia while having some share of other Southeast Asian countries and do very well. Grab can manage a weaker position in Indonesia while enjoying a stronger footing in other countries. 
 While the two companies will spend a lot of money to lead the race and one could become substantially larger than the other (Grab is already worth more based on  recent funding round benchmarks ), Grab and Gojek can still grow dramatically as individual entities, thanks to the digital economy penetration drivers mentioned above. In fact, their growth trajectory is essentially guaranteed – as long as governments don’t hinder them from expanding their services. 
 As such, Grab and Gojek’s primary existential threat isn’t each other, but rather governments preventing them from becoming the super apps they aspire to be. Burning cash to compete is a small price to pay for sealing a highly lucrative and long-term duopoly status in Southeast Asia. Staying separate is the smarter course.

 Founded in 2012, JupViec connects gig workers and households to address helper shortage and unemployment in Vietnam. It had previously raised seed funding from Japan’s CyberAgent Ventures. 
 The startup plans to use the new funds to support staff training and improve service quality. Tran said that JupViec also intends to enhance its app’s experience and expand its offering to cover other complex tasks such as cooking, ironing, virus disinfection, household sanitation, electronics maintenance, and butler services. 
 For the helpers on its platform, the company looks to provide more jobs and benefits, increase the frequency of professional training, and ensure their capacity to earn a substantial income through the platform. 
 JupViec joins STI’s portfolio of companies, which includes advertising company 24h Media Group, used car trading enterprise Anycar, 30Shine, and Sieu Viet Group. It will be integrated with STI’s ecosystem, which brings online-to-offline offerings to customers. 
 STI said it has invested in over 20 startups across Southeast Asia, most of which are based in Vietnam. ",Miguel Cordon,1,2,"[(0, 0.99953127)]","['STI', 'Tran']","['Asia', 'US', 'Japan', 'Vietnam']"
640928,"With Grab and Gojek growing, smaller players are waiting in the wings"," Dear readers, 
 Ride-hailing has upended traditional taxi services. No wonder some of my friends were alarmed when it was reported that Grab and Gojek are in  merger talks , as this would mean an end to their cheap rides. While the companies did not confirm the report, Gojek said that news was inaccurate. 
  Tech in Asia  CEO and founder Willis Wee had said in an opinion piece in January that the  merger makes sense , assuming it gets regulatory approval. Regulators will probably subject the two companies to more stringent scrutiny, opines  Vincent Fernando  in his  commentary .

 Indeed, the ride-hailing business in Southeast Asia offers such a huge opportunity that more operators are waiting in the wings. To fuel its ambition, Singapore-based  Ryde  is raising S$10 million (US$7.16 million) in a funding round led by Octava. 
 Apart from Ryde, here’s a quick list of other ride-hailing startups in the region: 
 
 Anterin – Based in Indonesia, it claims to operate in 100 cities in the country and have more than 300,000 drivers and 500,000 customers. MNC Group is looking to  acquire a majority stake .
 
 
 Tada – The Singapore-based player’s parent entity is MVL, which raised  US$5 million in a series A round  last December. Tada says it has over 50,000 drivers and more than 500,000 users across Singapore, Cambodia, and Vietnam. 
 
 
 Bykea – The Pakistani startup  raised US$5.7 million  in April 2019 and claims to have over 200,000 motorbike owners on its platform and over 2 million users in Karachi, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, and Lahore. It also says that its app sees 1 million bookings per month. 
 
 
 DriveUp – Launched  by the Meal Temple Group  just four months ago, the company claims to have the largest pool of drivers in Laos so far, with more than 100 taxis on its platform and plans to deploy  tuk-tuks  as well. 
 
 
 While some businesses have grown massively, other startups outside of ride-hailing are struggling to scale up. 
 Grocery delivery startup Honestbee, for instance, continues to  try to stay afloat . Similarly, co-living space operator Hmlet has  retrenched  some of its staff as it restructures its business.

 It’s not only the small startups that are facing challenges. Indian unicorn Oyo Hotels &amp; Homes recently reported massive losses for the year ended March 2019, and  Tech in Asia ’s  analysis  shows the SoftBank-backed company will remain in the red this year.

640794,Bukalapak’s seed round pitch deck,"     
 ||item|| 
 Q&amp;A 
  1. When was the deck created?  
March 2011. 
  2. How much did you raise?  
Not much, to be honest. We only managed to  raise capital  five to six months after this deck was created. 
  3. What happened after the fundraise?  
The first thing we did was to jump full time into Bukalapak. Back then, Bukalapak was just a small project under my digital agency Suitmedia. Fun fact: Bukalapak first started out as an  online bike-focused marketplace  before expanding to other verticals. 
  4. Lessons learned?  
Don’t think too much about investment or valuation; focus on the product. We launched Bukalapak in January 2010, and I strongly believe we have a pretty amazing growth so far. I’ve never seen an early-stage startup growing like that nowadays and believe it’s because we’ve been very focused on the product and serving our users well.

640905,What to expect from food delivery platforms in 2020,"  Disclosure: The author is the CEO of a food delivery company.  
 Anyone following the food delivery space can pick up on the signs of upheavals in the industry. Uber Eats sold its India business to Zomato, and Glovo – a Spanish unicorn operating in over 20 countries – closed down operations in four countries to achieve profitability by 2021. Delivery Hero, on the other hand, merged its two brands, Talabat and Carriage, in the Middle East and North Africa region.

 Growth at any cost is no longer an option for these platforms at this stage.  The Wall Street Journal  recently reported conversations between multiple food delivery companies in the US to  explore options of collaboration or consolidation . The reason is clear: venture capitalists are not interested in funding subsidies anymore. 
 The industry has very few profitable companies. Meituan-Dianping in China is one of the exceptions: The food delivery giant is operating in a competitive market and has a strong opponent in the form of Alibaba-owned Ele.me, which has turned profitable. Massive scale, focus on alternative revenue streams like ads and deliveries to other verticals, and effective fleet management has led to Meituan’s success. Another food delivery company, US-based Grubhub, is profitable, but its revenue is declining. 
 Other than these two firms and a few others here and there, no notable food delivery services are profitable. 
 Food delivery is an industry that has not yet weaned off of VC money. Uber Eats’ losses in 2019 were US$461 million on revenue of US$734 million. In 2018, Zomato lost approximately US$300 million and Deliveroo lost more than US$500 million. 
 The space, which has been built on subsidies, is now left stranded with little support from investors. Thin margins, low brand loyalty, and little differentiation are some of the things that make this business difficult. 
 But there are also signs that securing more funds will be a challenge. Swiggy raising a US$115 million round from its existing investors is a sign that its next big round is either late or is non-existent. Glovo rolling back from four markets right after its fundraising round is a sign that it has either been unsuccessful in raising the entire round or it does not expect the next one to be easy. 
 How will the industry evolve? 
 In this environment, the most natural option left for these platforms is to consolidate. By the end of 2020, it is expected that most markets will be left with a maximum of two major players, and some will become a single-player market. 
 During and after the consolidation, there will be corrections in the market. The natural goal of these platforms post-consolidation would be to finally return profits to their investors. Some visible and expected strategies for these platforms would be as follows. 
 Increase in commissions 
 This is already visible in markets where there is a monopoly or one large player with over 70% market share. The commission percentages have already gone as high as 40%, making a direct impact on restaurants. In price-sensitive markets, where establishments also get sizable volume from direct/phone orders, restaurants would be reluctant to increase the prices. 
 This problem has been addressed by the establishments in different markets by increasing the overall menu prices and then running offers/discounts on in-store and direct delivery channels. Building and growing their own delivery channel has become more important than ever. 
 Alternative revenue streams 
 Several food delivery companies have flirted with the idea of venturing into deliveries of other items including groceries and medicine. Meituan is already doing this successfully, and Glovo has always pitched itself as a multicategory app. On the other hand, Foodpanda has launched Pandamart in Singapore, Taiwan, and some other markets, where it onboards neighborhood convenience stores and supermarkets for grocery delivery. 
 These efforts allow the delivery platforms to improve their utilization, as food delivery has two peaks of two to four hours during lunch and dinner time. For better retention of couriers, they need to deliver more in the remaining hours. A natural choice for this is to venture into other deliveries. 
 Second, grocery and medicine are both verticals that have higher average order values. 
 Cloud kitchens 
 Cloud kitchens – also known as dark or ghost kitchens – have been around now for at least a couple of years. While there have been several models of ghost kitchens operating globally, one of the most standard models is the way platforms have built them. Food delivery platforms are at an advantage to identify locations of such kitchens as well as the right cuisines and brands for those places, based on the data that they have acquired over the years. 
 They’re also better positioned to finally lease some physical assets and provide a low-risk expansion path for restaurants, thanks to the money they’ve raised. Deliveroo and Talabat in Dubai and Swiggy and Zomato in India have allowed brands to expand very quickly through their network of cloud kitchens. And as delivery time ends up becoming the most important key performance indicator for any delivery company, a network of cloud kitchens can allow these platforms to deliver from nearby kitchens rather than from a distant branch. 
 Cloud kitchens have ranged from only leasing a location to managing the entire operations. The more services cloud kitchens are providing, the higher the share of revenue they keep. So far, these food delivery platforms have not ventured into sourcing/supply chain and kitchen operations services, yet their unit economics have improved for those orders which are being delivered from their cloud kitchens. 
 Brand ownership 
 To achieve profitability for these food delivery companies, the final step is to own the brands and run them through cloud kitchens to get 100% of the available margins. From all the data that these firms have acquired over the years, they can identify in each area the kind of brands that will pick up. 
 One of the pioneers in this space has been Rebel Foods, which  raised US$125 million in series D money in August 2019 . Following its footsteps, Swiggy and Foodpanda, have established their own brands in the Indian market. 
 Restaurant associations can sense this predatory move where establishments are becoming less important for platforms. Now that these food delivery services have a user base and are contributing a meaningful part in the revenue of a restaurant, they are becoming disproportionately more powerful. 
 As such, establishments are not shying away from openly expressing their concern over their strategic disadvantage. Most of them, especially those who have their own couriers, have stopped sharing customer data. 
 The restaurant industry has to move fast to maintain its relevance. With consolidation around the corner, the “winners” of the food delivery battle will be merciless in killing small- and medium-sized businesses to finally return profits to their shareholders. 
 With more last-mile delivery networks available, owning the logistics footprint is becoming less of a strategic advantage. This should push restaurants to build and engage with their own customers before it is too late. Who can deliver? Who will lose steam in the race? This year is going to define who the winners are, and the next couple of years are going to define the return on the billions of venture capital money that has been spent in this industry.

640938,Kickstart Ventures seeks potential Philippine unicorns with $200m fund," Philippine-based venture capital firm  Kickstart Ventures  said it seeks to support potential tech unicorns and help companies expand across Southeast Asia through its US$200 million fund,  Manila Standard  reported.

 “There is a 650-million person opportunity out there [in Southeast Asia]. We would like to see more Philippine companies thinking about the unmet needs across Southeast Asia, rather than just the Philippines,” Joan Yao, the vice president for investments at Kickstart Ventures, said in an interview with the local paper. 
 Launched in 2012, Kickstart Ventures is a wholly owned subsidiary of local telco Globe Telecom. It kicked off with US$2.4 million for its first fund, then closed a  second fund at US$50 million . 
 The company, which invests in early-stage to growth-stage tech startups, has supported 42 companies globally, including 30 in the Philippines, the report said. Its investment interests include enterprise solutions, media, content, advertising, health care, smart living, as well as energy, water, and waste management. 
 The firm’s portfolio of companies include Wattpad, C88, and Coins.ph – which was acquired by Indonesian unicorn Gojek – among others. 
 In 2019, Ayala Corp., one of the major shareholders of Globe, announced that it would work with Kickstart Ventures by allocating US$150 million in venture capital initiatives. The fund aims to support startups in sectors such as on-demand services, internet of things, fintech, blockchain, ecommerce, AI, machine learning, robotics, big data and analytics, and cloud computing. 
 Yao said the fund is looking to pour US$2 million to US$10 million into series A to C companies globally through the fund. “The fund hopes to make its first investment in the second quarter of 2020,” she says. 
 According to the vice president, the potential of local companies to become unicorns depends on how fast Filipinos will adopt digital solutions. 
 “We still need to see more Filipinos come online and really become comfortable in transacting online and build this digital economy,” she said. “Another thing is that these companies need to expand outside the Philippines. Many of Southeast Asia’s unicorns have come from Indonesia and Singapore, and Malaysia has Grab.” 
 In 2017, the Philippines saw its  first unicorn  rise: real estate startup Revolution Precrafted. The company’s valuation reached over US$1 billion after closing its series B round co-led by Singapore-based K2. 
 According to a report, the small number of startups receiving funding in the country may be attributed partly to cultural and economic factors. The Philippines lags behind its Southeast Asian peers in VC investments, recording the smallest total funding raised by startups at  US$28.8 million  in 2018.

640990,CXA Group lays off dozens of Singapore staff in cost-cutting effort,"  CXA Group , the Singapore-based corporate healthcare insurance startup backed by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, has laid off dozens of employees, former and current staff tell  Tech in Asia . 
 One employee Tech in Asia spoke to says that there are plans to lay off “close to 40 people” across engineering, product development and marketing departments as part of cost-cutting measures. A number of employees have already been axed last week. 
 CXA Group CEO Rosaline Chow Koo confirmed the layoffs in a written email to  Tech in Asia , but said only 12 people were affected. “To right size our team, we cut 12 employees in Singapore out of a total of 319 employees regionally to maintain healthy growth and making on-going investments,” Koo says. 
 The startup currently has 148 employees in Singapore.

 Almost the entire product team is gone, an employee who is serving out his notice says. 
 Several senior staff members  Tech in Asia  spoke to say that investors had previously raised concerns over revenue growth and the startup’s burn rate. 
 Founded by Koo in 2013, CXA disrupts the corporate insurance space by providing customized health benefits to employees. Unlike typical corporate insurance plans that offer a one-size-fits-all solution for all staff, users of CXA’s platform can shop for a range of wellness and health services by drawing down existing insurance policies provided by their employer. Purchases are made via an e-wallet that reflects account balances in real time. 
 In March 2019, the company raised  US$25 million  from investors including HSBC, Singtel Innov8, and MDI Ventures. Koo told  The Business Times  at the time that the startup “may not need additional funding” since CXA was expected to break even in 2020. 
 However, Koo changed her tune in September with an announcement of her intentions to raise  a further US$50 million  at a valuation of US$250 million. “We’re going back out only because we’ve signed very long-term contracts to actually be white-labeled by these firms globally,” she said. 
 Revenue for the company in 2018 was S$18 million (US$12.9 million), a figure that was expected to double in 2019. Koo says that revenues for the company grew 50% in 2019, and that the company remains on track to become profitable “despite operational challenges presented by the Covid-19 outbreak.”

 The fundraising effort has so far been futile, with several potential investors pulling out, employees with an understanding of the matter say. It’s unclear why these deals are falling through. 
  Tech in Asia  understands that teams have now been trimmed to a minimum, with the remaining operational staff just enough to sustain operations and “run the show,” one employee says. 
 On at least one team, all business development executives have been let go, and other sales staff have been offered commission-based salary plans and have had their salaries cut in half. “There is no negotiation – you either take it or quit,” says a former executive familiar with the matter. 
 Current and former CXA staff  Tech in Asia  spoke to say that firing is commonplace in the startup, where there have been instances of entire departments being let go and replaced – sometimes without reason. Previous exercises, however, have been more isolated, affecting one or a few employees at a time. 
 According to its website, CXA serves 766,000 employees and counts Fortune 500 companies among its 600 clients worldwide. The platform focuses on preventive healthcare and early detection of diseases rather than on disease treatment alone, and claims that it can help companies save on medical expenditure. The startup also has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, and Jakarta.

640975,Used car marketplace Spinny bags $43.7m in series B money," India-based used car platform  Spinny  has raised US$43.7 million in a series B round led by Fundamentum Partnership, a mid-stage-focused growth fund backed by Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani and investor Sanjeev Aggarwal.

 US-based General Catalyst Partners and Korea’s KB Financial Group also participated in the round, alongside existing investors Accel, SAIF Partners, and Alteria Capital, according to a statement. The raise pushed the company’s post-money valuation to about US$150 million, according to  TechCrunch . 
 The startup plans to use the fresh capital to improve its technology, strengthen business teams, enhance customer experience, and expand into new cities in India. Currently, the company said it has nine car hubs that operate across Delhi-NCR, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. 
 Spinny uses an online-to-offline model, allowing customers to discover cars on its website and make the final purchase offline at a Spinny Car Hub. Once a customer books a car, the company takes care of all the paperwork and provides them with financing options through its banking partners. 
 According to the statement, India’s used car segment has seen steady growth over the past few years due to the rise of first-time car buyers looking for affordable options. There are around 4.3 million units sold annually, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 14%. 
 Spinny, founded in 2015, looks to capitalize on this growth by offering a more organized approach to used car buying, as most of the deals in the market happen through traditional means, the company said. 
 “With the increase in disposable income levels and evolving consumer demand, we want to be the market leader in the organized used car market segment, and provide our customers a completely trustworthy and hassle-free buying experience,” said Niraj Singh, co-founder and CEO of Spinny. 
 In May last year, the company raised  US$13.2 million  in a series A funding round led by Accel and SAIF Partners as it looked to cover more locations and bolster its inventory.

640970,Indian lending startup SMEcorner raises $30m," Mumbai-based  SMEcorner , a fintech startup that provides credit to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), said it has raised US$30 million in a series B round led by Indian private equity firm Paragon Partners, with participation from existing investors Quona Capital, Accion Venture Lab, as well as SMEcorner founder and CEO Samir Bhatia, among others.

 The latest round, which was raised as a combination of equity and debt, saw Paragon Partners investing US$10.5 million, while the balance came from other investors, the company said in a statement. Last year in June, SMEcorner had raised series A+ round led by Quona Capital. 
 The startup plans to use the fresh funds to scale its business, forge partnerships, and expand in existing markets over the next financial year, with an aim to lend US$138.3 million (10 billion rupees) by the end of FY 2021. 
 “The additional capital will enable us to reach over 20,000 new customers and grow our distribution in the coming year,” Bhatia said in a statement. “We will continue to focus on building proprietary technology which will help us serve our customers more efficiently.” 
 Founded in 2014 by Bhatia and Sneha Shah, SMEcorner started as a financial lending firm, catering to the unorganized retail sector, primarily shopkeepers, in India. It obtained its NBFC (nonbanking financial company) license in February 2018 and is currently present across 15 cities in India. 
 The startup claims to have served over 8,000 unique customers and has disbursed over US$76 million (5.5 billion rupees) since obtaining the license. The company said it has about US$55 million (4 billion rupees) worth of assets under management. 
 SME lending is slowly catching up in India, and companies are either getting an NBFC license themselves or are partnering with a third party to enable lending for their clients. Recently, B2B ecommerce firm ShopX that works with retailers partnered with LoanTap to facilitate credit for its customer base. 
 SMEcorner competes with new companies as well as bigwigs like SoftBank and Alibaba-backed Paytm, Walmart-owned payment platform PhonePe, and Coatue Management-backed payment solution firm BharatPe. While lending to small retailers has become the focus area over the last two years for BharatPe, other fintech companies are steadily strengthening their focus towards this space. 
 “SMEcorner’s high-tech and touch model makes it uniquely positioned to facilitate credit to the highly underpenetrated micro and small enterprise segment,” Siddharth Parekh, co-founder and senior partner, Paragon Partners, said in a statement. “The asset-light model powered by several co-lending partnerships makes the business resilient from liquidity challenges and a highly granular loan book makes it resistant to any lumpy asset quality issues.”

 With the new funds, iPrice said it seeks to go beyond its existing business lines and become a top online shopping companion in Southeast Asia and a key ecommerce enabler for super apps. 
 Founded in 2014, iPrice currently has about 1.5 billion product listing on its platform from over 1,500 merchant partners across Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. It has expanded to offer product discovery opportunities for fashion items, home and living products, and coupons for various categories. 
 According to the e-Conomy SEA 2019 report from Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company, ecommerce is the region’s biggest and fastest-growing sector, valued at US$38 billion last year. That number is expected to rise to US$150 billion by 2025. 
 Iprice said it saw a total of 5 million transactions made on its platform and over 20 million monthly visitors last year. 
 The company also said its main iPrice business unit accounted for 50% of revenues, operating at a 30% EBITDA margin. It aims to turn its other verticals to similar profitability within the next two to three years. 
 “To pursue our next journey, we need to be where the consumers are,” said iPrice CEO and co-founder David Chmelar. “We need to engage users directly on our platform, continue our strong presence on Google, as it remains a vital starting point for many shoppers, and enable partners across the region, such as media platforms, social media apps, and all the emerging super apps, to provide ecommerce content for their audience.” 
 Prior to this round, iPrice bagged  US$4 million  in a round led by Line Ventures in 2018. It also raised the same amount in a  series A  round in December 2016.

 Founded in 2016, the Mumbai-based company creates and aggregates videos, which it embeds through its publisher partners including Samsung, Xiaomi, Micromax, Karbonn Gionee, and MX player, among others. It also offers publishers with white-label solutions such as a video player that can be directly integrated with their platforms. 
 “Indian internet users are growing fast and online video consumption has grown from zero to 60% of all internet traffic in India. All apps and websites now want to show videos to their users, if they need to survive,” said Saurabh Singh, CEO and co-founder of Flickstree. “We help bridge this gap. Not only does video content increase user engagement, it also allows our publisher partners to earn more revenues without doing any additional effort.” 
 The company plans to use the new funds to further develop its technology around content and expand into Southeast Asia. 
 Flickstree will also foray into social and shopping videos and launch a new affiliate initiative for its publisher partners later this year, according to the statement. 
 The company previously raised seed funding from Venture Catalysts, Indian cricket board chief Sourav Ganguly, and SOSV. It is backed by Facebook via the tech giant’s FbStart program.

 The company plans to use the new funds to open its new generative AI research center in Singapore and expand in the US.

 Founded in 2015, FlixStock aims to solve the challenges around the creation and usage of fashion images for ecommerce sites. By using deep-learning algorithms, the company creates website-ready model images at scale without the need for elaborate photo shoots, according to a statement. It can increase the number of on-model images generated every day with an 80% cost reduction, said Paul Santos, managing partner at Wavemaker Partners. 
 “Images are key to successful ecommerce, but the production of fashion images has never seen any innovation,” said Harindar Keer, founder and CEO of FlixStock. “We offer a suite of solutions to help retailers create images in large scale at a fraction of the existing costs.” 
 The Singapore-based startup introduced solutions for online retailers in 2018 after three years of doing research and development in stealth mode. It currently has offices in seven countries and serves more than 60 major retailers globally, the company said. 
 According to Statista, fashion takes up the largest part in the business-to-consumer ecommerce market, valued at nearly  US$519 billion  in 2018. It’s expected to grow at 12.2% per year to reach a total market size of US$922 billion by the end of 2023. ",Doris Yu,1,2,"[(2, 0.9993878)]",['FlixStock'],"['US', 'Singapore']"
640814,"With fresh funding, Snapask expands tech-driven learning across Asia"," Snapask, an educational technology startup that has just raised a  US$35 million funding round , started out with – and is mostly known for – its namesake feature, which lets students upload a photo of their homework and get help from tutors.

 But since its founding in 2015, the Hong Kong-based company now offers more services, such as Sofasoda, a feature that helps university students learn soft skills, and Wizmo, a platform that provides teachers with student analytics. Snapask also operates Lab, its network of physical classrooms where students in a number of Asian cities can study after school. 
 With the fresh funding, the company plans to expand into professional-grade educational videos while also doubling down on Southeast Asia, a key growth market. According to Snapask founder and CEO Timothy Yu, the vision is to drive a “revolution” of self-directed learning across Asia. 
 “Overall in Asia, education is a top priority to get better opportunities in society. Students and families [are willing to] pay a lot to invest in education,” he says. While the region can be too exam-driven, Yu cites how the latest education trends emphasize a return to the basics, which encourages students to learn and grow independently. 
 Beyond Q and A 
 Snapask’s bread and butter includes its Q and A feature, which connects over 3 million students to 350,000 tutors, as well as its teaching videos and courses focused on university entrance exams. 
 The company’s newer services were introduced in recent years. Lab was launched in 2018 to provide after-school study spaces in Hong Kong, Taipei, and Seoul. Yu says that the Snapask team saw how difficult it was for students in these cities to find such a place. The typical venue option is a McDonald’s or a Starbucks, where students often hog multiple tables, stay for hours, and purchase a minimal amount of food or drinks. Unsurprisingly, this practice (which is also observed in Singapore) often draws the ire of other patrons and the establishment itself. 
 Wizmo, a business-to-business enterprise product, was rolled out after the Snapask team found out how a lot of teachers are burdened with administrative work. Instead of giving out homework assignments – which teachers often do to track their students’ progress – Wizmo collects data points and visualizes them in a “clean way,” Yu says. 
 “What questions are students asking? What do they need exactly with regards to content?” he points out. “This lets teachers focus on teaching instead of evaluation and administration.”

 Launched during the latter half of 2019, Sofasoda’s unusual name has a backstory. The team pictured students lounging on a sofa with a can of soda and using the app to learn soft skills, like “how to debate, negotiate, do a good presentation, or game theory,” Yu recalls. “Not traditional teaching content, but something [that can] help a person grow and be competitive in the market.” 
 The idea for this feature came about when the company realized that many loyal Snapask users would stop using the app when they graduate high school. “If we don’t have offerings for students after that stage, it will be a big loss,” Yu notes. “How can we re-engage these users?” 
 That aside, Yu says that the Q and A interaction between students and tutors continues to be the driving force for Snapask. But it also prompted the team to explore how to develop engaging content. 
 “Imagine students coming home at night, needing homework help. A lot of students come to us with that expectation,” he says. “But then we do observe that learning and education. It’s also about how students can better ingest knowledge through educational content.” 
 Leveling up 
 With the latest funding, Snapask plans to develop educational videos with television- or movie-standard production values, not run-of-the-mill ones. Currently, what exists in the market are mostly videos of tutors writing on a piece of paper or blackboard that were recorded using a smartphone. But this is not engaging enough, Yu contends. Even with platforms like Coursera or Udemy, which target university students, the course completion rates are generally below 10%. 
 “We want to bring change in educational content, reinventing how we structure and build this content,” he says, adding that Snapask’s goal is to give “a reason for students to finish the whole thing.” 
 To this end, Yu is bringing a team of people from the TV and film industries to spearhead production. 
 Snapask also plans to double down in Southeast Asia. While Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore have been its biggest markets in terms of maturity and profitability, around 20% to 60% of its clients are from Southeast Asia, according to Yu. Apart from Singapore, the startup has a presence in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Vietnam will be the next stop. 
 “One of the reasons [behind the expansion] is the overall market size and student population in this region, as well as increasing demand for online education,” Yu says. “Although Hong Kong and Taiwan are profitable markets, they’re limited in terms of market size, while Southeast Asia has unlimited upside.” 
 Snapask has over 500,000 active users in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand combined, compared with 120,000 in Hong Kong and 200,000 in Taiwan, he says. The company is also present in Japan and South Korea, but Yu didn’t disclose numbers.

 The startup runs on a subscription model, with prices varying per country. In Hong Kong, the cheapest plan is a 10-session pack that costs HK$180 (US$23). The most expensive allows for unlimited sessions and costs HK$880 (US$113). In comparison, the most affordable option in Indonesia is a 10-session pack costing 99,000 rupiah (US$7), while the advanced plan gives users 60 sessions a month for 459,000 rupiah (US$33). 
 Southeast Asia’s edtech space is not without competition. In Singapore, for instance,  Geniebook  similarly places an emphasis on personalized learning. 
 Meanwhile, the dominant player in Indonesia is  Ruangguru , which recently raised  US$150 million  in a series C funding round. 
 Ruangguru claims to have 15 million users in Indonesia, its only market. That figure is more than five times Snapask’s total user base, but Yu says Southeast Asia is a big enough market that can take in more players. 
 “From one question posted on Snapask, there are 50 different ways that students can misunderstand a concept, and there are many ways tutors can explain that concept,” he observes. “What we should encourage is more and more of these companies to create personalized quality education at scale, and we can make a very big change in the industry.” 
 Room for growth 
 Yu think that there are many similarities between Southeast Asian countries and Hong Kong or Taiwan. Students and their families are willing to invest heavily in education because they see it as a path towards a better future. 
 “There is still room for Southeast Asian markets to grow,” he adds. 
 But huge opportunities often come with challenges. For example, it will be difficult for Snapask to scale its operations in Indonesia and Malaysia, which are much bigger compared to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. 
 “High-quality teachers are concentrated in major cities, so you can imagine them being crammed in one place and what’s left for the rest are subpar teaching resources,” Yu says.

 While most Snapask users in Indonesia hail from cities like Jakarta, Surabaya, and Bandung, those that come from smaller cities still make up over a third of the user base. Yu believes that the company’s role is to give these students access to top-notch tutors. 
 Demand for online education services have increased in recent weeks as many students stayed at home amid the unprecedented spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Snapask has signed up 1.2 million users in the past 12 months, with over 30% subscribing to the service within the past two months. 
 “If quality education is really about quality teachers who are helpful, available anytime to guide students, [as well as] quality content that is engaging enough, [then] this opens up new topics to reflect on,” Yu says.

640672,Commentary: Turning disaster into a driving force," Dear Readers, 
 Remember your big plans for 2020? Like, say, wanting to grow by 10x on all fronts? 😂 
 You may have started to feel that it’s gonna be extra challenging to reach your ambitious goals, especially as Covid-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world. (Note: We’re trying to assess how the novel coronavirus has affected tech businesses in Asia. If you have three minutes, please share your thoughts with us  via this survey .) 
 Apart from its disastrous impact on public health, the disease outbreak has disrupted business, frustrating a lot of founders and operators in various industries. The current situation looks something like this: 
 
 People are staying at home to avoid getting sick. Naturally, offline retailers as well as the  travel, transportation, and events sectors aren’t doing well .
 
 
 Understandably, affected businesses are cutting down on spending. 
 
 
 In turn, this triggers other businesses to slash costs too, regardless of whether such a measure is truly needed or not. 
 
 
 As more businesses suffer, fearmongering kicks in and this cycle continues, potentially putting us into an economic recession. 
 
 
 I’m worried too, particularly when events are a significant part of  Tech in Asia ’s business. But I believe it’s more productive to take action and implement changes instead of just fretting about it. 
 
  Screengrab from Crocodile in the Yangtze – The Alibaba Story 
 
 A kind friend passed along a document that details how Alibaba responded to the SARS epidemic 17 years ago. One of the steps that the Chinese tech giant took was to turn a bad situation into a driving force – a lesson I wholeheartedly agree with. 
 We can use this opportunity to find weaknesses in the company and make improvements. Another positive approach is to think about the business’ longer-term prospects and prepare for the future. 
 I find myself discussing this topic more and more with my wife and also other founders. While the prevailing mood is mostly doom and gloom, I’m also excited to see how things will turn out in the end. It’s survival of the fittest, and I’m confident that our team, culture, and values can tide us through this tough period. 
 I’m closing this week’s commentary with an inspiring quote from Alibaba’s SARS guidance:  “People’s mindsets are usually built from experience and challenges. Victories often belong to those who can face difficulties and survive.”  
 See you next week!

640792,This music startup in Vietnam quietly garnered 700 million downloads worldwide," 
 The February issue of  Forbes Vietnam  always garners a lot of attention in the country with its annual 30 Under 30 roster. This year, one name stood out: Nguyen Tuan Cuong, co-founder of  Amanotes . 
 Unlike some of the stars highlighted by  Forbes , Cuong and his company have stayed out of the limelight until now. 
 
  Amanotes co-founder and chief product officer Cuong Nguyen / Photo credit: Amanotes 
 
 Amanotes was founded in 2015 by Cuong alongside CEO and co-founder Vo Tuan Binh. It is now a fast-growing music tech startup based in Ho Chi Minh City, known chiefly among players of hyper casual mobile music games. 
 Even though the company is low-key, App Annie last year ranked it as one of the top 20 publishers of mobile apps across all categories, sitting alongside tech giants Facebook and Bytedance.  SensorTower  also placed Amanotes among the top 20 app developers in the world, with the highest number of downloads in 2019. 
 Its flagship product,  Magic Tiles 3 , simulates piano, guitar, and drum playing set to popular songs. It has been downloaded 275 million times since launching in 2016. 
  Meeting of minds  
 In 2012, the two co-founders met for the first time through a post in Launch, an informal Facebook group for everything related to Vietnam’s tech and entrepreneurship network. 
 Cuong, a recent graduate of Foreign Trade University then, was looking for a job at a startup. Binh previously founded a music game startup called MusicKing, but it went belly up in 2009. Having played the piano, Vietnamese bamboo flute, and guitar, but also coming from a technical background, Binh wanted to embark on a new project that combines music and technology. 
 The two hit it off. 
 Cuong was drawn to the vision of building a startup that focuses on interactive music games. The two co-founders started doing research and exploring new concepts. 
 During the company’s early days, Amanotes was primarily self-funded. The team held off the process of seeking external funding by maintaining a small revenue stream from building websites for other Vietnamese companies. 
  The magical success of Magic Tiles 3  
  Magic Tiles 3  was inspired by the success of  Piano Tiles , released in 2014 and developed by Chinese creator Hu Wen Zeng. Cuong recalls that Hu’s game was so popular that many other developers cloned his game and released them with tweaks of their own. 
 The team at Amanotes like the format of  Piano Tiles , but saw an opportunity to build something different. 
 “We want to enable users, even those without any musical background, to play a full composition,” Cuong said. “Therefore, we focus on making the music come as alive as possible.” 
 Cuong said Amanotes decided very early on to target a small niche – hyper casual mobile music games, meaning games that required just one or two actions from players. 
 According to Cuong, developers in this corner have to deal with the high cost of acquiring licenses for the songs they want to use in their games, as well as marketing costs to get their name out in markets where most players are already bombarded with countless mobile games. 
 The startup made the financial plunge and invested in licenses for songs. The combination of high-quality music and technology that ensures realistic musical interactions was key to putting  Magic Tiles 3  on the map. 
 Cuong said that Amanotes’ success was rooted in allowing users to experience entire songs instead of looped melodies or monophonic sounds. 
 Launched in 2016,  Magic Tiles 3  was two years in the making, and opened the door for Amanotes to become a major (but understated) player in mobile game publishing. The company accomplished this even without spending much on marketing in the past. 
  “Everyone can music”  
 “Our motto is ‘everyone can music.’ And you can see that music here is a verb, not a noun,” Cuong said during a chat with  KrAsia  in Ho Chi Minh City. “Most people just like the music, listen to the music, but we want to enable them to interact with the music.”

 After making the cut for  Forbes’  30 Under 30 in Vietnam, the 29-year-old has become the face of Amanotes. Having graduated with a master’s degree in innovation and entrepreneurship from the University of Amsterdam, he’s now the company’s chief product officer, overseeing product development and strategies for a series of hit games that have been downloaded more than 700 million times by users across the world. 
 Amanotes doesn’t disclose its financial details, but Cuong said its revenue is generated from advertising and in-app purchases. Amanotes also has profit-sharing agreements with indie developers that have published their games on Amanotes’ platform. 
  Global ambitions  
 The Singapore-registered startup now has 140 team members drawing from 10 nationalities working in Ho Chi Minh City. Amanotes has another office in Singapore, and has plans to soon open one in the US, where a large chunk of its users are. 
 The company recently hired Bryan Teo as its chief operating officer, whose previous roles include CEO of online marketplaces Cho Tot and 701Search, both of which  were recently acquired by Carousell . 
 Cuong said that Amanotes’ long-term plan doesn’t only include building new apps. The company will develop a complete music ecosystem for publishers, developers, singers, players, and people learning how to play music, and release it as a tool for other indie developers. 
 At the moment, Amanotes is an outlier in the startup community in the sense that it has not received any institutional funding since its establishment in 2015. “But we’re looking into that right now. Our goal is to have the funds to acquire other startups that can advance our ‘everyone can music’ vision to the next level,” Cuong said.

640801,Co-living operator Hmlet sees big changes with layoffs and a pivot," Hmlet, a Singapore-based startup that leases spaces and sublets them to long-term tenants, is undergoing its biggest overhaul yet. 
 The co-living operator will no longer directly rent, renovate, and operate properties. Instead, it’s going “asset-light” by helping landlords run Hmlet-branded co-living spaces, the company’s co-founder and CEO, Yoan Kamalski, tells  Tech in Asia . This echoes the approach that Oyo and RedDoorz have taken in travel accommodation. 
 The shift comes at a cost. Hmlet had retrenched around 10% of its employees as their roles had become redundant, says the CEO.

 A source familiar with the company says that the actual number could be even higher, and that the layoffs had started in December of last year. Some of the people who left were senior regional or country operations leads, though the startup did not confirm their identities. 
 Hmlet isn’t planning to shrink its headcount, however. As of end-2019, the company had 198 employees, Kamalski says. Indicating its postings on various jobs platforms, he adds that the startup is “hiring a lot more than we’ve had to let go.” 
    
 Hmlet seems comfortable in terms of cash flow. It raised a sizable  US$40 million round  in July last year from the likes of Sequoia Capital India, Japanese real estate developer Mitsubishi Estate, and VC firm Burda Principal Investments. 
 “We’ve no plans to fundraise,” Kamalski says. Without detailing financial figures, he adds that the startup expects to grow its tenant base by 3x this year compared to 2019. 
 The average tenure of its members – spread across Singapore, Hong Kong, Sydney, and Tokyo – is 13 months. 
 High upfront costs 
 Sources tell  Tech in Asia  that part of the reason for the pivot may have been the high upfront and ongoing costs that come with leasing, managing, and sprucing up properties. 
 A Hmlet spokesperson, however, views “[the leasing] model as highly scalable yet sustainable” despite the high operating costs. He insists that the model could be profitable if the startup wants it to be. 
 Nonetheless, Hmlet’s management had thought about winding down rental contracts since 2018, though it only pursued the platform approach toward the end of last year. Now, it plans to make money through revenue-sharing arrangements with property owners.

 “To be able to disrupt real estate, we had to move away from contracts and tenancy agreements,” says Kamalski, adding that landlords don’t often interact with tenants – there’s a middle layer of property agents, interior designers, and contractors. 
 “The real goal is not about creating arbitrage [through subletting], but empowering landlords to have direct connection to the customers,” he says. 
 To this end, Hmlet is expanding its engineering team to build a new portal that will offer landlords access to services, including data on tenants, to help them run their own accommodations. 
 The CEO declined to share more details about its new service for now, so it’s unclear how it’ll differ from other property tech endeavors.

 Hmlet is sure to run up against  KoolKost , a co-living spun off by RedDoorz that’s active in 100 properties across 14 cities in Indonesia. 
 Property owners in KoolKost’s pilot project saw an average increase of 30% in room occupancy, the company claimed. Oyo also has a co-living arm, called Oyo Life.

 Kamalski, meanwhile, compares his new approach to Netflix. 
 “Movie producers were producing blockbusters not knowing if it would be a success,” he says. Netflix is changing that by using data on consumer behavior to dictate the type of content they acquire. 
 “It’s a very similar thought process for living spaces,” the founder adds. ",Terence Lee,0,3,"[(2, 0.81766135), (3, 0.18219762)]","['VC', 'Oyo', 'Hmlet', 'RedDoorz']","['Singapore', 'KoolKost', 'Asia', 'Sydney', 'Indonesia', 'Tokyo']"
640793,PhonePe tops up its wallet with $60m from Singapore-based parent entity," Soon after putting all its muscle behind homegrown e-tailer Flipkart, its American parent Walmart is making sure it doesn’t neglect its digital payment subsidiary,  PhonePe . The world’s largest retailer has big plans for PhonePe, which landed in its lap when it acquired  Flipkart  in a US$16 billion deal in 2018.

 As per regulatory filings sourced by Paper.vc, PhonePe is getting a lift up with US$60 million in fresh funding from Singapore-based parent entity PhonePe Private Ltd. According to its filings with the Indian regulator, PhonePe has allotted 1 million shares to the holding firm in lieu of the investment. 
 In October 2019, Walmart reportedly was preparing to spin off PhonePe as an independent unit. 
 PhonePe competes with SoftBank-backed payments company Paytm as well as global giants such as Google Pay and Amazon Pay for India’s soon-to-be US$1 trillion digital payments market. With the ever-increasing competition in the digital payments market and major players changing their focus from targeting P2P transactions to peer-to-merchants, PhonePe has been preparing for a long fight ahead. Over the last 12 months, PhonePe has raised almost US$400 million across five rounds, the last one being the recent US$60 million funding. 
 It is to be noted that the company has been reeling under heavy losses while investing in acquiring customers and merchants and diversifying its services. The company made a loss of US$266 million (19 billion rupees) on revenue of just US$25.7 million (1.84 billion rupees) in the financial year ended March 31, 2019. Last week, in the post-earning presentation to analysts in New York, Judith Mckenna, CEO of Walmart International, said PhonePe’s annual payments value stood at US$180 billion with nearly 20 million daily users on the platform. 
 In a bid to slowly move toward creating a profitable business, PhonePe has been upgrading its platform and adding revenue channels here and there. 
 Earlier this month, the Bengaluru-based company launched a chat feature so that users can have a conversation with each other while requesting money or confirming the receipt of payment without needing any other messaging app. The in-payment chat tool, open to its over 175 million users, is integrated within the money transfer flow feature on PhonePe. In January, it partnered with 500,000 neighborhood stores to launch digital ATM feature for PhonePe users, who can go to one of these mom and pop stores and transfer the amount of money they need to the store owner’s PhonePe account to get cash in return.

640773,"Thai edtech startup Quest raises seed funding from Reapra, others","  Quest , a Thailand-based coding education platform, announced that it has closed a six-digit seed funding round with Singapore-based VC firm Reapra, along with angel investors.

 It plans to use the new funds for its real-time coding talent platform that offers a full-stack automated teaching curriculum backed by blockchain. 
 Quest started from the Edtech Hackathon 2018 in Bangkok and was selected as a finalist for Project Alpha by Singapore-based SeedPlus. It focuses on soft skills and coding skills, and monetizes the service through a workforce reskilling program. 
 According to the company, up to 20 million manufacturing jobs around the world could be replaced via automation by 2030. It then sees a business opportunity in reskilling people to help them find better job opportunities. 
 The company also said it’s expanding to the online conferencing business with its Reach LeanSpace product to provide an education solution for small and medium-sized enterprises in Thailand. 
 According to  Markets Insider , the global e-learning market is expected to reach  US$238 billion  by 2024 at a compound annual growth rate of 8.5%. The Asia-Pacific region, especially India and Southeast Asia, represents a huge growth potential for education industry revenue. 
 Last year, Jakarta-based Ruangguru raised  US$150 million  in a series C round led by General Atlantic and GGV Capital, which is said to be one of the largest rounds for an edtech company in Southeast Asia. India-based Byju’s is valued at about  US$8.2 billion  after a US$200 million funding round also with General Atlantic. 
 Kirk Pathumanun, CEO and co-founder of Quest, told  Tech in Asia  that the company is looking to raise more funds from Reapra, local agency Depa, and another investor by Q4 2020 in a multiparty investment deal. 
 The startup earlier received US$80,000 in grants from Depa and TED funds for its blockchain-backed workforce management app. ",Doris Yu,0,2,"[(3, 0.9993876)]","['Quest', 'VC', 'app', 'Ruangguru', 'SeedPlus', 'TED']","['Singapore', 'Asia', 'Byju', 'Alpha', 'Bangkok', 'India', 'Thailand', 'Jakarta']"
640409,SparkLabs to pour $100k in IoT startups via new accelerator,"  SparkLabs Group , a network of startup accelerators and VC funds, has launched SparkLabs Connex, a new program focused on internet of things, smart cities, and proptech.

 Connex aims to support startups working with key market drivers and tech enablers such as 5G monetization, sustainability, green building initiatives, low-power wide-area networks, eSIMs, AI, and security, according to a statement. 
 Charles Reed Anderson, founder of Singapore-based IoT and smart city advisory firm CRA &amp; Associates, will lead the program as managing partner. He previously served as a senior advisor at McKinsey &amp; Company and led IDC Asia Pacific’s mobility and telecoms practices. 
 SparkLabs will be investing up to US$100,000 in each startup that will participate in the program in exchange for a 7% equity share, Anderson told  Tech in Asia . As a global accelerator, the company will be accepting startups from any location, but those selected must be in Singapore for the first session and the demo day. 
 “This is basically an expansion of SparkLabs IoT and creating a better accelerator program with a wider mandate and stronger partnerships,” Anderson added .  “Now it’s not just Songdo, South Korea, but Singapore, Taipei, and Darwin, Australia.” 
 SparkLabs IoT is a global initiative that the company launched in Songdo, a business and residential complex that Korea considers as the world’s first purpose-built smart city. The program was  launched in Singapore  in November 2018 through a partnership with local investor and venture builder IncuVest. 
 SparkLabs has tapped corporate partners such as Nokia, True Digital, Skyroam, international smart-city network Go Smart, and the Urban Technology Alliance to bolster the Connex program. It will announce more partners in the near future, Anderson said. 
 Founded in 2013, SparkLabs says it has invested in over 280 companies across six continents to date, including healthcare firm Docdoc, fintech startup Aire, and beauty ecommerce company Memebox. 
 Apart from Connex and SparkLabs IoT, the group’s ecosystem includes Seoul-based SparkLabs Korea, agritech- and foodtech-focused SparkLabs Cultiv8 in Australia, SparkLabs Taipei, SparkLabs Frontier in the US, and innovation-as-a-service platform SparkLabs Foundry, among others.

640746,Ride-hailing app earlier funded by Sea targets $7m in Octava-led round," Singapore ride-hailing app  Ryde  is looking to raise S$10 million (US$7.16 million) in an ongoing funding round. 
  Octava , a family office also based in the city-state, is leading the round with a commitment of S$2.3 million (US$1.65 million) 
 
  Photo credit: Ryde 
 
 Eric Koh, partner at Octava, tells  Tech in Asia  that the firm is backing Ryde because it’s among just a handful of companies poised to receive a ride-hail service operators’ license under Singapore’s  new regulatory framework  for point-to-point transportation, which will come into effect in June. 
 Grab and Gojek are also expected to obtain ride-hail permits, while taxi companies will get separate street-hail service operators’ licenses. 
 If it obtains the license, Ryde will be seen as a “credible” player and would be in “a good position to expand into other markets,” Koh says. The app is already available in Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Sydney, albeit on a small scale. 
 Mean and lean 
 Koh says Ryde’s financials and operational numbers show that it’s “running mean and lean,” as he claims that the company can be more cost-efficient than other operators. 
 Aside from a  problematic foray  into on-demand delivery, Ryde has remained focused on ride-sharing as its larger rivals have diversified into areas like financial services, food, and logistics.  Tech in Asia  understands that the startup employs about 30 people, compared to Grab’s 6,000 and Gojek’s 3,000-plus. 
 A person familiar with the company told  Tech in Asia  Ryde had S$30 million (US$21.5 million) in gross merchandise volume and S$3 million (US$2.15 million) in revenue in 2019. 
 In 2018, the company’s revenue jumped to S$984,000 (US$704,000) from S$15,635 (US$11,000) the previous year, driven mainly by commission from driver earnings and third-party bookings for partner taxi companies, according to filings with the Singapore Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). 
 However, Ryde’s losses widened from S$1.49 million (US$1.07 million) to S$3.37 million (US$2.41 million) over the same period, the filings showed. 
 Merger opportunity 
 News of Ryde’s latest funding round comes amid reports that Grab and Gojek are  holding talks  about a  potential merger . Grab at the same time announced a bumper  US$856 million injection  of fresh funding from two Japanese investors: banking giant MUFG and IT firm TIS. 
 Ryde held a 1.2% share of Singapore’s ride-hailing market in 2018 in terms of completed trips, putting it in third place behind Grab and Gojek, which respectively had a 95% and a 3.8% share, according to ABI Research. 
 A merger between the two regional giants still seems a long way off, but if it does take place, “then Ryde gets promoted to number two in Singapore,” Koh says. With the biggest players in the market joining forces, demand for alternatives is likely to rise – similar to what happened after Grab acquired Uber’s regional operations back in early 2018. Though a Grab-Gojek merger would undoubtedly face high regulatory scrutiny, it could actually present an opportunity for third-placed Ryde to increase both its driver and rider numbers. 
 Sea’s stake 
 Ryde’s previous fundraising efforts include a  US$1.5 million seed round  in November 2015 with undisclosed “strategic angel and private investors.” 
 In May 2017, Ryde founder and CEO Terence Zou told  Tech in Asia  that it had secured a  further US$500,000  in seed capital but didn’t share details about the investors. 
 The startup also announced an undisclosed amount of investment in January 2019 from an entity  called Nomad X , with the latter’s chief investment officer and director Tan Suanjin coming on board as Ryde’s chairman. 
 According to its most recent ACRA filing made earlier this month, Ryde has issued 414,200 ordinary shares with total paid-up share capital of S$4.77 million (US$3.4 million). Zou had the largest holding with 155,769 shares, followed by Garena Ventures – a subsidiary of New York-listed  Sea Group  – with 110,450 shares. 
 It isn’t clear when Singapore-based Sea, which operates ecommerce site Shopee and gaming platform Garena, invested in Ryde. While the ACRA filing seems to indicate that Sea owns a substantial stake, someone familiar with the matter told  Tech in Asia  that the company now considers its holding to be “negligible” due to dilution and other changes, suggesting its investments happened several years ago. 
 Share capital details filed with ACRA may not accurately reflect past investments as they don’t always take convertible debt and other modes of funding into account, or may not have been properly updated. 
 It’s also unclear if Nomad X’s investment is reflected in the ACRA filing. Tan left Ryde in November last year, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
 In April 2014, Sea – then known as Garena –  began recruiting  for Garena Ventures. The fund’s mission was to invest in Asian mobile and internet-centric businesses, with an aim to deploy eight-figure US dollar amounts in investments each year. 
 Other startups that Sea has backed include  China’s Wecash  and  Singapore beauty marketplace Vanitee . 
 Sea acquired  Vietnamese restaurant directory Foody.vn  in 2017 and  Canadian games studio Phoenix Labs  last month. 
 Octava’s other investments include health-conscious snacks e-tailer  Boxgreen , ecommerce payments provider  Rely , and esports group  Team Flash .

640752,AI healthtech firm Qure.ai bags $16m in Sequoia-led round," Indian healthtech startup  Qure.ai  has raised US$16 million in a funding round led by Sequoia Capital India to expand into new markets. 
 MassMutual Ventures Southeast Asia also participated in the round, according to a statement.

 Headquartered in Mumbia, the startup aims to make healthcare more accessible and affordable through the use of AI, with a focus on radiology. It uses AI to enhance imaging accuracy and provide automated interpretations of exams, such as X-rays and CT and MRI scans. 
 “This funding round will allow us to further invest in research and development and to expand the reach of our solutions, accelerating our mission of delivering accessible and affordable health care to every human being,” said co-founder and CEO Prashant Warier. 
 The company also said it plans to use the new funds to expand its product portfolio and support regulatory clearances. 
 According to  Inc42 , there were a total of 4,892 startups in the Indian healthtech space in 2018. These startups fall under categories like home healthcare, diagnostics, biotech, and biopharma. Overall, the companies in these segments raised a total of US$504 million in funding from 2014 through 2018, according to the report. 
 Anjana Sasidharan, principal at Sequoia Capital India, said that Qure.ai sets itself apart in the industry with its ability to deploy commercially at scale across a number of markets, “something many others have failed to do, as strong algorithms [don’t] always translate to robust commercial products.” 
 All of Qure.ai’s solutions are CE-certified, the startup claims. Its head CT product remains as the only solution in the industry to detect every critical brain abnormality, including five types of intracranial hemorrhages, cranial fractures, infarcts, midline shift, and mass effect, according to the statement. 
 Qure.ai, founded in 2016, was incubated by AI and analytics leader Fractal. It currently has a presence in over 20 countries and has developed a database of over 7 million scans. ",Miguel Cordon,1,2,"[(2, 0.999552)]","['MRI', 'AI']","['Mumbia', 'AI']"
640754,Grab unveils Vietnam-focused accelerator program,"  Grab  has launched a Vietnam-focused accelerator program for early-stage startups to capitalize on the country’s fast-growing tech ecosystem, the company announced today in a media statement.

 Vietnam is the first regional country where the company’s accelerator, called Grab Ventures Ignite, will operate. The program is an extension of the ongoing  Grab Ventures Velocity  program focused on post-seed startups. 
 Five startups in the new program will receive a cash investment of US$150,000 from Grab and Gobi Partners, Grab’s funding partner for the project. Selected startups from the accelerator will also undergo a 14-week training program in Ho Chi Minh City, in addition to receiving other benefits such as cross-border exchange with Singaporean startups. 
 Startups from sectors such as mobility, food, payments, financial services, logistics, ecommerce, and AI are particularly encouraged to apply, said the company. 
 “Vietnam’s startup ecosystem is very well-poised for digital disruption by startups, with investments increasing sharply over the last year,” said Chris Yeo, head of Grab Ventures. “We now want to pave the way for startups to grow and scale faster, playing our part in solving the country’s challenges.” 
 In 2019, funding to Vietnam-based startups accounted for 18% of total investment in the region (about US$741 million), a huge jump from the previous year where it only accounted for 4% (US$287 million), according to a report by early-stage Singapore-based VC firm Cento Ventures. 
 Grab has recently announced its latest funding of  US$850 million  from Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. In Vietnam, Grab said last August it would commit  US$500 million  over the next five years, as the country has been identified as Grab’s “next growth market” after Indonesia.

640712,Edtech startups defy funding blues," Education-focused startups are on a tear across Asia, bucking the broader investment decline in the startup industry. 
 Funding for tech startups in the region  fell  by more than 50% in January, with companies in China and Southeast Asia seeing  a massive drop  in investments. The trend will likely persist as Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, continues to spread like  wildfire .

 Beating the funding blues, however, are a multitude of education-focused startups that rely heavily on technology to scale up. Edtech firms managed to raise fresh capital in a tepid market that has prevented many unicorns from pursuing initial public offerings, as venture capital firms have turned their focus to profitability following the fiasco at SoftBank-backed  WeWork  last year. 
 Byju’s, India’s only profitable unicorn, has had the biggest funding round among edtech companies so far this year, raising US$200 million in a deal that valued it at about US$8.2 billion. Another Indian company, Unacademy, raised US$110 million in a series E funding round earlier this month. Snapask, a Hong Kong-based online learning platform, on the other hand, has become the latest edtech company to  raise funding  as it seeks to expand across Southeast Asia. 
 Tiger parents pay up 
 Among the most active investors in the edtech space is Sequoia Capital, with investments in India-based firms Byju’s, Eruditus, Cuemath, InterviewBit, and Doubtnut. 
 “In highly competitive markets like India and Southeast Asia, parents are even more keen for their children to perform well in exams and find better employment opportunities,” says GV Ravishankar, a managing director at Sequoia Capital India. “This results in them investing significantly in their children’s education, creating a large and vibrant market for K-12 supplementary, test prep, and continuous education – which in turn has created a rich market for startups to succeed.”

 There are numbers to back this up. Asian edtech firms raised more capital than their global peers in 2020, according to Pitchbook data.

 India in the lead 
 This year, Indian edtech companies led the region in terms of funds raised. 
 With more than 250 million school-going kids, India has one of the largest markets for the industry globally, says Ravishankar. 
 Demand for online education in the country is also expected to rise to about US$2 billion in 2021 from US$247 million in 2016,  according  to a 2017 report by KPMG and Google. 
 Since 2017, close to US$2 billion have been invested into Indian edtech startups, according to Chennai-based researcher Venture Intelligence.

 An untapped opportunity 
 India’s huge population means that the student-to-teacher ratio lags behind developing countries, and the problem is even more severe in government-funded schools due to apathy from officials. The situation has led parents to invest in after-school tutorials. 
 With the funds they’ve raised, startups in the edtech space are transitioning the country from conventional tutoring methods to technology-based platforms, using video streaming, AI, and machine learning to scale up their services. One such example is Doubnut, which   raised   US$15 million from Tencent and other investors in January to build more content for its video-based learning solutions and widen its market reach. 
 Doubtnut co-founders Tanushree Nagori and Aditya Shankar, alumni of the famed Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, used to run a private coaching center until they realized that they were spending more time answering student queries than actually teaching them. This prompted the duo to launch Doubtnut, a free app that lets students ask questions across many subjects.

 While the platform had teachers fielding questions, the flurry of queries from students became overwhelming, says Nagori. 
 “The problem was much bigger than we thought,” she says. “A power user at Doubtnut ends up asking about 45 questions a month – that, too, from only two subjects.” As students typically send in a number of queries, paying even 100 to 200 rupees (US$1.40 to US$2.79) per question was unaffordable, Nagori explains. 
 To solve the problem, the app now uses AI and machine learning to scan the picture of a problem and give answers via video tutorials and other means. 
 Such innovative solutions, which allow the business to scale up, make edtech startups attractive. 
 “Given the spend in the industry and the reasonably average ticket sizes, many parts of the edtech market have the ability to be attractively profitable,” says Sequoia’s Ravishankar. 
 “Companies that build a strong brand with low-cost, high-reach distribution channels have a higher chance of success and the ability to build profitable models at scale,” he says.

 Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.

 Founded in 2017, US-based AnsweriQ is an AI-backed customer support company that uses algorithms to read and understand interactions from past tickets between the customer support agent and the customer. 
 This allows businesses to automatically classify and respond to usual issues and provide agents with recommended responses. Some of its current clients include 2K Games, Freshly, and SeatGeek. 
 Freshworks said it will incorporate AnsweriQ’s technology in its chatbot,  Freddy , to enhance its AI capabilities. With the integration, Freddy will be able to anticipate customer needs, make recommendations for agents based on conversations, and perform tasks such as refunds and cancellations with no manual input required. 
 As part of the deal, AnsweriQ CEO Pradeep Rathinam joins Freshworks as chief customer officer. In his new role, Rathinam will oversee the company’s global customer support, onboarding, and customer success organizations. 
 AnsweriQ is Freshworks’ second acquisition in less than a year, following a nearly 60% year-on-year growth in billings, the company said. In May 2019, it acquired customer success service Natero, an AI and machine learning company that helps businesses manage their clients. 
 Freshworks, which is based in California, also recently raised US$150 million in a series H funding round from Sequoia Capital, CapitalG, and Accel at a US$3.5 billion valuation. The round pushed the company’s total funding to almost US$400 million, according to Crunchbase. 
 Founded in 2010, Freshworks now has more than 2,700 employees spread across 13 offices around the world. ",Miguel Cordon,0,2,"[(2, 0.9995652)]","['AI', 'Freddy', 'Natero', 'Crunchbase', 'Freshworks']","['US', 'California', 'AI']"

 Founded in 2016 by Yoni Luksenberg and Ariel Klikstein, Elementor provides an open-source, drag-and-drop platform to enable professional web creators to build websites according to their needs. 
 It will use the new funds to scale its operations and expand its global community, with 500 meetups planned across the globe for this year. Elementor also plans to grow its team by 50% as it gears up for major product launches. 
 “In addressing a very real need, we have claimed a growing stake in a US$300 billion market. With this round of funding, we accelerate to our goal of allowing every web creator to easily build professional websites,” said Luksenberg, who is also the CEO of Elementor. 
 The company has been serving web developers, designers, and marketers in 152 markets. It says over 4 million websites were built using its no-code platform. It now aims to accelerate its growth by adding more than 1 million sites built every six months. 
 One big player in the space is Nasdaq-listed Wix, which is also Israel-based. It recently reported total revenue of over US$761 million for 2019 and expects to see nearly US$1 billion in revenues this year.

 The total investment consists of A$1.4 million equity (US$918,000) and AU$350,000 (US$230,000) debt from investors including VFS Group and others. 
 
  Photo credit: Cheq 
 
 Founded in 2019, Cheq uses machine learning, AI, location data, and statistical analysis to offer personal financial management solutions and allow Australians to access cash of up to A$200 (US$130) per pay cycle. 
 The service does not charge additional fees and interest, but there is a fixed transaction fee of 5%, compared to the 52% to 1,000% annualized percentage rates charged by payday lenders on similar amounts, the startup said. The debts will be recouped from a user’s bank account once wages are received to ensure people can’t exceed their spending capacity or get trapped in debt. 
 According to a study cited by Cheq,  5.9 million  Australians currently live pay to pay, admitting they couldn’t survive financially for more than a month if they suddenly lost their job or could no longer work. 
 Cheq said that POD services were only accessible via enterprise human resource management systems, excluding 70% of workers in small businesses and startups. Through its direct-to-consumer solution, the company aims to prevent users from turning to “predatory” payday lenders that charge high interest rates and fees. 
 “You can get food, TV shows, cleaning services, dog walking, and everything in between on demand. So why is it that we can’t yet access our own money – money we have already physically worked for – as soon as it’s needed?” said Tarek Ayoub, CEO and co-founder at Cheq. 
 The company claims that about 600 users have already downloaded the app within two days of its beta launch. It found that most funds were used for transport and groceries, though many users left the money untouched in their accounts.

640665,"New digital payments rules: a win for consumers, or the death of choice?"," Prior to January 28 this year, financial technology companies in Singapore could operate with relative freedom. 
 That changed when the city-state recently enforced the Payments Services Act, which increases oversight on digital payments services including currency exchange, domestic and cross-border money transfers, as well as account issuance. The stricter safeguards are aimed at increasing consumer confidence in these new technologies and ultimately promoting the broader adoption of e-payments in Singapore.

 Major digital wallet operators and payments providers that  Tech in Asia  spoke to are on the fence regarding the new rules. While the impact has not yet been felt by some, many have voiced concerns over how the act could limit their operations in the country, leaving consumers worse off in the near term. 
 The new policies impose an individual limit on personal payment accounts of S$5,000 (US$3,600) at any given time, while limiting annual transactions to a maximum of S$30,000 (US$21,500) for digital wallets and virtual accounts. These rules would help “maintain the stability of the banking system” and guard against abrupt, massive outflows of money from the city-state’s financial system, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). 
 A spokesperson for London-based fintech company  Revolut , which launched its services in Singapore with much fanfare last October, tells  Tech in Asia  that the new activity-based regulation “creates concerns on how best we, and other financial technology companies, can serve Singapore customers.” The spokesperson adds that the startup has yet to see any significant movement of funds in reaction to the new policies. 
 “We are adopting a regulatory structure that recognizes the growing convergence across payment activities,” said the country’s minister for education, Ong Ye Kung, at the second reading of the Payments Services Bill in January 2019. “For example, payment and remittance services are now often provided as one product to customers.” 
 Among digital e-wallet operators, differentiation comes in the form of incremental offerings: Multicurrency mobile wallet operator  YouTrip  offers favorable foreign exchange fees targeted at travelers, while Revolut offers commission-free stock trading and a peer-to-peer payments function on top of its remittance service. On top of its main cross-border money transfer service,  TransferWise  also lets users open borderless bank accounts that come with their own local bank details. They all issue accompanying physical debit cards.

 It’s arguably the constantly evolving services of these companies that the new activity-based regulation is aiming to tackle. 
 ‘Unnecessary complexity’ 
 The caps were designed “with due consideration to industry practices and typical household expenditure needs, and should provide sufficient headroom for most individuals,” the MAS said in December, in response to feedback received on the proposed regulations. The regulator added that these are initial limits, which can be reviewed over time. 
 Nium CEO Prajit Nanu tells  Tech in Asia  that the new regulations are “unnecessary complexity.” For the open money platform, which licenses its banking infrastructure to enterprise customers, a S$30,000 limit on annual transactions limits the addressable market for Nium to those with annual salaries below the amount. 
 Asked whether the Singapore market would diminish in importance for the startup relative to its other markets as a result of the new rules, Nanu said, “These are the rules – automatically it would be.” 
 Higher spending and demand  for fintech innovations abroad are also driving Nium’s attention to other markets like Mexico and Malaysia. 
 The MAS added that it would make exemptions on transfers from customers’ personal payment accounts to their own overseas personal bank deposit accounts to accommodate overseas remittances to meet financial commitments such as paying rent, mortgages or financial support to family members. 
 It would also allow customers to make occasional large payment transactions and transfers via their personal payment accounts, “provided all sums above S$5,000 are transferred out of the personal payment account by the end of the day.” 
 Digital wallet operators remain concerned. 
 “With outflow limits at S$30,000, expenditure that cannot be fulfilled by e-wallets is effectively being protected for the banks,” TransferWise CEO Kristo Kaarmann  wrote  in an opinion piece. Kaarmann added that the new limits were “highly constraining” and “a step backward” for the activity-based regulation. 
 To comply with the new rules, YouTrip has reduced the annual spending limit of its product from S$100,000 (US$71,400) to S$30,000. It anticipates that frequent travelers – business travelers and Singaporean students who are on overseas exchange programs in particular – might hit the S$30,000 limit pretty quickly.

 While YouTrip supports the regulation, it finds the S$30,000 limit on transactions overly restrictive. “The intent to reduce the risk of significant outflows from bank deposits to non-bank e-money should have already been sufficiently addressed through the imposition of the S$5,000 e-wallet balance limit,” the company’s CEO and co-founder, Caecelia Chu, tells  Tech in Asia . 
 The S$5,000 limit on e-wallet balances is a simpler and lower-cost means of consumer protection compared to deposit insurance requirements which banks are subject to, Chu says. 
 A cashless society? 
 Digital wallet operators will potentially experience a revenue squeeze if they aren’t able to pivot and expand their portfolio to additional services fast enough. 
 There are signs that these fintech operators will get more sophisticated as they evolve, offering more varied and added services to capture a bigger slice of the pie. YouTrip, for one, plans to incorporate tools on budgeting as well as personal financial management to complement its core travel e-wallet offering. Revolut also aims to soon introduce its commission-free stock-trading app in Singapore, a feature already available to its users in the UK.

 What then do the tightened regulations ultimately mean for consumers? 
 A reshuffling and reorganization of funds across their various digital or physical bank accounts is possible. While one multipurpose account with a single digital wallet operator might have tackled everything from daily expenditure, savings, remittances, and peer-to-peer transfers, new limits on personal payment accounts will mean users must have separate accounts with different operators. 
 “It raises the question of ‘Are we truly becoming a cashless society or more of a more-cards society?’ One user will need to have multiple e-wallets and cards so they don’t hit the limit,” says an industry watcher who asked not to be named. 
  Tech in Asia  contacted the MAS but the regulator did not provide further comments beyond a statement that was read in parliament during the bill’s deliberations in January 2019 and official responses made in December 2019 on feedback to the proposed regulation. 
 Despite concerns raised by some fintech players about the new regulatory restrictions, many in the industry will maintain their operations in Singapore, a market which they consider a springboard to expanding their presence in the region. The ability to successfully operate in the city-state will give fintech players a metaphorical seal of approval in the region’s most highly regulated financial sector. 
 “We continue to believe in the potential of the Singapore market,” says the Revolut spokesperson. “We are on target to double our headcount this year and are in the process of moving to a larger office to serve the rest of the region from Singapore. Our customers here can look forward to more innovative and exciting products and services in 2020.”

640629,Y Combinator-backed food delivery startup Dahmakan raises $18m series B round," Direct-to-consumer food delivery startup  Dahmakan  has raised US$18 million in a series B funding round that included participation from new investors Rakuten Capital, White Star Capital, Japan Associated Finance Corp.

 Other investors in the round include Korean food delivery unicorn Woowa Brothers and the former CEO of Nestle Germany, with follow-on investment from existing backers Partech Partners and Y Combinator, according to a statement.

 Dahmakan, which means “have you eaten?” in Malay, was founded in 2015 by former Foodpanda execs Jonathan Weins, Jessica Li, and Christian Edelmann. It was part of Y Combinator in 2017 as the first Malaysian startup to be accepted into the accelerator program. 
  See:  Dahmakan is Malaysia’s first startup to be accepted into Y Combinator   
 According to Weins, the company’s CEO, their mission is to build a chef-made delivery product that the mass market can use every day. “We knew from our experience launching Foodpanda in Hong Kong that removing high delivery and operating costs while bringing food closer to the consumer would be a core part of this mission,” he said. 
 Rather than trying to create a marketplace, the startup’s founders focused on taking control of the entire value chain from product development to last-mile delivery from its network of satellite kitchens. 
 “We combine a small operational footprint across multiple locations to ensure lightning-fast delivery with high levels of automation in back-of-house operations, made possible through our investments in software and industrial design,” said Edelmann, the startup’s chief technology officer. 
 Dahmakan plans to use the new funds to further develop the operating system that powers its end-to-end business. 
 According to a statement, the startup has soft launched over 40 new dishes monthly from more than 2,000 tested dishes. It uses customer feedback, market insights, and other data to create a menu that features different best-sellers and Dahmakan-exclusive creations every week. 
 In May 2019, the startup raised over  US$5 million  in a series A round prior to the launch of its distribution satellite kitchens in Malaysia. It was looking to use the funds for its growth in new and existing markets.

 The company plans to use the new funds to expand the presence of its Sygna product line beyond Asia Pacific and continue to develop its flagship product, CoolWallet S. 
 Founded in 2014 by Michael Ou, CoolBitX provides solutions for the blockchain industry to foster the adoption of virtual assets through its products. 
 CoolWallet S is a credit card-sized hardware wallet that can be paired with users’ mobile phones via bluetooth. The Sygna line of products, on the other hand, are tailored toward virtual asset service providers (VASPs), simplifying the process for VASPs to meet the compliance standards of the traditional financial industry. Ou said that CoolBitX will be establishing a Sygna entity in Japan this year. 
 “The blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is at a critical juncture. In the global blockchain race, the rate of adoption and innovation in Asia is undeniable, witnessed by regulatory developments and investments in the past year,” said Ou. 
 Last year, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released its latest standards to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, where a new rule requires crypto exchanges to collect and transfer customers’ personal information during transactions. CoolBitX launched its Sygna Bridge solution to help VASPs become FATF-compliant.

 Founded in 2015, Snapask started out with a feature that lets students upload a photo of their homework and get answers from tutors. This question-and-answer feature remains the company’s main product, but its offerings have since expanded to include Sofasoda, which prepares university students for job interviews. It also has Lab, which provides students with after-school study spaces in Hong Kong, Taipei, and Seoul as well as Wizmo, an analytics platform that allows teachers to track their students’ progress. 
 The company will also use the latest funding to develop educational videos.

640509,"Why some medtech products fail to take off, despite rising healthcare spending"," There’s a chance you’ve never heard of  Mirxes  (pronounced Mi-rex-sis) before the Singapore-based medical technology startup started making test kits for Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
 The startup, when has been licensed by the city-state’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star)’s commercialization arm to produce the Covid-19 test kits since February 14, is manufacturing enough kits for  up to 100,000 tests  weekly. These are sent to hospitals in its home market and China. But despite this recent foray, making such kits isn’t the company’s bread and butter.

 The startup’s main business is creating blood-based diagnostic tests based on the analysis of microRNA (a type of nucleic acid) that’s secreted by tumor cells. Its flagship product is GastroClear, which was launched last October after eight years of development. 
 Singapore may have no shortage of technological infrastructure, talent, or governmental support, but a series of hurdles have hindered the widespread adoption of medtech products. Even if the technology is proven to be both effective and safe, setbacks such as the high cost of capital, distribution issues, or consumer perception tend to get in the way. 
 Mirxes is one of over 170 healthtech startups in Singapore. The company, which raised US$40 million in a series A round in 2018, is considered one of the better-funded medtech firms. For context, the total deal value in the healthtech sector was S$105 million (US$75 million) in the country that year. But the challenges in this space lie beyond obtaining funding.

 Commercialization roadblocks 
 GastroClear is an  early-stage stomach cancer detection test  and serves an alternative to invasive endoscopic procedures. 
 Mirxes claims that while GastroClear displays “superior performance” compared to other modes of detection, it’s been difficult to bring it into the market and scale in terms of adoption, sales and revenue, CEO Zhou Lihan tells  Tech in Asia . 
 He declined to disclose the adoption rates of GastroClear in Singapore, where it’s available in Tan Tock Seng hospital and selected private companies, but he says a more representative number of the product’s success is the pickup it’s seen in China. 
 Mirxes has established partnerships with almost a hundred health-screening clinics in Asia’s largest economy, where more and more tests are being conducted. “We have seen the number scaling from 20 to 30 a week initially to hundreds per week subsequently,” Zhou shares. 
 The reason for its success in China is multifold. A higher incidence of cancer in China translates to more awareness about disease prevention and willingness to spend for medical screening, he explains. And unlike in Singapore, where people are used to paying for medical expenses via a national program called  MediSave , it’s typical for Chinese citizens to pay for such services out of their own pockets. 
 But structural barriers related to distribution and purchasing policies can be problematic. “In China, distribution costs can be as much as 70% to 80% of the final customer price,” Zhou says. “In the US, the percentage is a lot more attractive towards the innovator that developed the test.”

 Dealing with red tape within public institutions, including central procurement and tendering processes, and meeting the requirement for feasibility studies before the state approves spending on new products can also be tricky. In comparison, selling to private clinics boils down to whether one physician or customer sees the value in the product. 
 “There may be existing purchasing policies that exclude startups, such as the requirement to only procure from companies that have a track record of sales of more than 10 years,” points out Hsien-Hui Tong, head of venture investing at  SGInnovate . 
 Government-owned SGInnovate is one of the most active venture capital firms in Singapore’s healthcare technology scene, making four investments between August 2018 to August 2019. It has invested in firms including Tricog Technologies, See-Mode, and Web Biotech. 
 Tong says SGInnovate remains “more conservative yet focused” on stroke, cardiovascular ailments, and other chronic illnesses that are likely to be major causes of death a decade from now. “We will continue to add to our existing portfolio of companies in these areas,” he notes. 
 Meanwhile, Mirxes is actively exploring grants offered by the Ministry of Health or the National Health Innovation Center (NHIC) which could encourage public hospitals to use GastroClear by reducing procurement costs, Zhou says. 
 GastroClear kits currently cost between S$150 to S$199 (US$107 to US$102) in Singapore. The price depends on a range of factors, such as whether the kits are obtained from direct channels or via screening clinics and private or public institutions, and whether additional phlebotomy (blood-taking) support is required. In China, the kits are priced between 399 yuan to 499 yuan (US$57 to US$71). 
 Lagging healthcare spending 
 As a region, ASEAN-6 (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines) had a combined public healthcare expenditure of US$240 billion in 2019, placing it at 1% to 4% of total gross domestic product, according to a study conducted by Singapore’s Economic Development Board (EDB). 
 While that’s behind the 7.7% of GDP spent on average by countries under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the EDB projects that healthcare public expenditure will grow to US$740 billion in ASEAN-6 by 2025. That makes Mirxes optimistic despite the obstacles in its path.

 “A lot of novel products can be reimbursed fairly quickly and at a very high price in the US,” Zhou says. “In the US, a company with a single product in a single market can have a revenue of close to US$800 million within a year.” In addition, medtech firms typically obtain a reimbursement from insurance companies that help to cover the cost of research and development of a product. 
 Zhou did not disclose Mirxes’ current revenue figures, but he says the startup has achieved a compound annual growth rate of 90% yearly since its inception in 2014 till 2018. 
 It’s not just Singapore that’s underinvesting in healthcare. Collectively, Asian countries lag behind the 20% of GDP that the US spends on healthcare, generating more funds for the development of new technology in the West. 
 This can make it difficult for novel technologies, which take years and a lot of funding to develop, to quickly scale up. “The initial cost of either manufacturing, distribution or getting adoption is still high, before the volume kicks in,” Zhou says. “If we don’t find a good means of getting through that phase – to hit a really large volume – then cost cannot drop. If cost does not drop, it does not get mass adoption in Asia in general.” 
 Insourcing manufacturing 
 Unlike consumer products that can be typically farmed out to places such as China to save on manufacturing costs, outsourcing the production of niche items such as those involving nucleic acid may not be cost-effective. “We don’t have a lot of suppliers in Asia that are truly capable of delivering both quality and low costs,” the Mirxes CEO says. 
 The startup has invested in its own manufacturing capabilities as a way to control spending associated with commercializing medtech products – a fairly uncommon practice for Asian medtech firms. 
 Generally, they keep a research and development facility while delegating production and commercialization efforts to a regional company. The kind of capability that Asian medtech companies have to build is way more than what US companies have to develop at the same stage, according to Zhou.

 An unintended – and positive – effect of doing so is Mirxes’ transitioning from R&amp;D to manufacturing. It’s able to employ its production capabilities to help partner companies transform their research into physical diagnostic kits, as was the case with the Covid-19 kits. 
 Mirxes will also soon begin a prospective clinical trial for one of the world’s top five pharmaceutical companies. This will involve 60 hospitals in the US and Europe, collaborating to develop a non-oncology application. 
 “This project happened because they saw the value of Mirxes not only as a niche microRNA technology developer, but with a complete capability of translating research into a regulatory approved diagnostic kit,” Zhou notes. 
 Since bringing GastroClear to market, Mirxes has moved into the next phase. It’s now studying the feasibility of creating a similar early-detection kit for lung cancer, working with a global consortium of scientists in the US, Italy, China, and Japan. The startup has over 20 different disease areas in its clinical pipeline, including diabetes and heart ailments as well as some neurological diseases. 
 Fundraising continues to be an ongoing process for Mirxes, which has raised US$43.5 million in series A and seed funding to date. Revenue is “growing steadily,” according to Zhou, with one of its business units expected to break even this year. While 2020 is shaping up to be a tough time for startups looking for financing, the startup is “not pressured to raise money that soon,” he adds. 
 Mirxes expects to achieve at least 30% of revenue as it enters new markets like Japan and diversify into agricultural and veterinary technology, while growing its core business units in in-vitro diagnostics, life sciences reagents, and contract development and manufacturing. 
 At the same time, Mirxes is looking to strengthen its core microRNA and platform businesses. “If there are additional technologies that we can partner with people to develop, that will [help] us in creating a total solution for early cancer screening, we will definitely say yes to that,” Zhou says.

640555,China’s Didi set to challenge Uber Eats with Japan expansion," China’s largest ride-hailing platform, Didi Chuxing, plans to officially launch its food delivery service in Japan in April, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. 
 Didi told  KrAsia  that it will first roll out the service in Osaka, adding that it has already begun recruiting food delivery couriers in the city.

 The move comes as Didi ramps up expansion in the Japanese market. The Beijing-based company already has an established taxi-hailing business in the country via Didi Mobility Japan, a joint venture with Japanese conglomerate SoftBank launched in July 2018. Didi has since expanded to over 20 regions in Japan including Tokyo, Kyoto, and Hokkaido, partnering with over 500 taxi companies, the company said. 
 By launching its new food delivery service, Didi is set to challenge Uber Eats, the service provided by its main rival, Uber Technologies. Uber Eats was launched in Tokyo in September 2016 and now operates in 10 Japanese cities, covering over 10,000 restaurants. 
 In Japan, ride-sharing, which relies on drivers with their own cars, is banned. Therefore, ride-hailing companies have entered the market by teaming up with local taxi operators to launch taxi-hailing services. Uber has been in the market since 2014, but has had to content itself with food delivery and high-end limo services before launching a taxi-hailing pilot on the island of Awaji (near Osaka) in May 2018 by working with 20 local taxi firms. Other players in the market include JapanTaxi and online service provider DeNA. 
 This is not Didi’s first attempt to challenge Uber Eats in an overseas market. In April 2019, it launched its food delivery service in Mexico, covering three cities in the country as of last November.

640533,CrewScale to acquire Indian tech gig startup Indiez," Indiez, a  platform  for hiring freelance coders, has agreed to be acquired by remote talent hiring service CrewScale. The move comes as the global pivot toward profitability nudges mergers among competitors. 
 Both firms help companies hire teams to build tech projects. Indiez co-founder Nitesh Agrawal told  Tech in Asia  that the acquisition by CrewScale will go toward scaling up the offerings for the combined entity. “There is a bigger opportunity for a [software-as-a-service] product in the remote work space,” said Agrawal. 
 Previously, Freelance Community Inc., the company that runs the Indiez platform and website, had 10,000 programmers. The acquisition will bring that number up to 16,000, Agrawal said. 
 Indiez has been profitable since it began operations in 2016. The company said it was  bootstrapped  for its first year before raising US$500,000 in seed funding.

 The deal comes as the Covid-19 outbreak forces companies to deploy remote working strategies. The spread of the illness has helped draw attention to systems and processes that help remote workers, which so far have worked on the fringes of the global tech industry. 
 Texas-based Crossover Markets, Inc., which runs freelancer-hiring website Crossover, is widely  regarded  as a pioneer in the remote tech working industry. Peers include  Toptal  and  MainStreet , along with websites like Freelancer, Gigster, Fiverr, and UpWork. 
 The combined entity will act as a one-stop shop for companies looking to hire a software development team. Remote working systems such as Slack, Asana, and Zoom will be integrated directly into the platform, along with project team leaders and coders, says Agrawal. 
 GoScale, CrewScale’s parent firm, counts companies like Amazon, Uber, Grab, Swiggy, Tokopedia, and Ola as clients. The startup has been profitable since its inception in 2017 and is growing at 200% year on year, it said. Indiez’s clients, on the other hand, include Domino’s Pizza, Uber, and Indian conglomerate Aditya Birla Group. 
 The deal will help expand GoScale’s operational capabilities in the US, helping it compete with the likes of Toptal, the company said. 
 “Indiez seemed like an obvious choice to partner with,” said GoScale Group Inc. CEO Raghu Bharat in a press release. “Together, we can become the top player in the domain.”

The funds will be used to develop its financial services across the region. 
 Japanese bank MUFG will inject up to US$706 million into Grab, while TIS, a Tokyo-based provider of networking solutions and system integration services, will invest US$150 million. MUFG’s investment was previously  reported  by  Bloomberg .

 Through the partnership with MUFG, Grab said that it plans to create lending, insurance, and wealth management products for Southeast Asian consumers and small businesses. 
 TIS and Grab, meanwhile, will collaborate on enhancing the digital payment infrastructure in Southeast Asia and Japan to enable greater adoption of cashless payment options, such as its own GrabPay wallet. 
 Grab established its fintech platform, Grab Financial Group, in 2018. In addition to payments and remittance with GrabPay, it also provides microlending and microinsurance services, complementing the super app’s ride-hailing and food delivery businesses. It will soon launch GrabInvest, a retail wealth management portal, following its  acquisition  of robo-advisor Bento earlier this month. 
 In recent years, Grab has partnered with a number of financial services providers, such as Mastercard, Credit Saison, Chubb, and ZhongAn. In December, it formed a  consortium  with Southeast Asia’s biggest telecommunications company, Singtel, to bid for a digital full bank license in Singapore. 
 Its archrival, Gojek, is also expanding its financial services. It recently launched  GoSure  to offer insurance products related to travel, motor vehicles, and mobile device protection.

 “Our plan is to scale existing and newer channels for gold monetization. We will use the fresh funds to invest in technology, customer acquisition and work towards improving the accessibility of credit in the country,” said Sumit Maniyar, CEO at Rupeek. 
 Founded in 2015, the fintech startup enables local big banks to offer gold-backed loan products by collecting and depositing the precious metal at the nearest branch of the partner banks that offered the loan. 
 The digital lending platform currently operates in 10 cities, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, New Delhi, Jaipur, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, Coimbatore, and Pune. It aims to offer its service to 1 billion Indians by 2022 across 100 cities. 
 Rupeek said that India has almost 90% of gold lying idle. It aims to monetize India’s US$1 trillion gold and help the country achieve a US$5 trillion economy by 2025, according to a statement. 
 “For India’s middle-class households, gold has long been a favorite way to save and invest,” said Hans Tung, a managing partner at GGV Capital who has now joined Rupeek’s board following the investment. “Rather than letting it sit idle, Rupeek has turned a family’s dormant asset into an easy way to get a loan at affordable rates to grow their small business or pay for emergency needs.” 
 The company raised US$2 million in a seed round in 2017 from Sequoia Capital, followed by a  US$6.8 million  series A funding round with Accel Partners in 2018. Last year, it secured US$30 million in a series B round led by Bertelsmann India Investments.

640505,Indonesia’s questionable unicorn," JD.id’s recent  declaration  that it’s become a unicorn has been met with doubts from Southeast Asia’s industry insiders. 
 “The concept of paper valuation has reached new heights,” says a senior executive from a rival firm. 
 Skeptics have reason to question the claim: Easily accessible numbers portray JD.id, the Indonesian arm of Chinese ecommerce giant JD, as a small player that’s lagging behind its competitors. 
 The way in which JD.id was valued also aroused suspicion.

 JD has declined to comment, while JD Indonesia’s executives did not respond to  Tech in Asia’s  messages. 
 The ecommerce company’s valuation seems to be linked to another unicorn: Indonesian super app Gojek. 
 In October 2018, JD was revealed to have joined Gojek’s series E round. 
 Three months later,  The Information  reported that Gojek was in talks to invest in JD.id at a valuation of over US$1 billion. The super app was also thinking of buying a majority stake in a separate entity, JD’s Indonesian logistics joint venture, J-Express. 
 A source familiar with Gojek tells  Tech in Asia  that the company did not invest in JD.id in the end. Instead, the two firms signed a commercial agreement. Meanwhile, J-Express now says on its website and LinkedIn page that it’s a subsidiary of Gojek. 
 Gojek has declined to answer  Tech in Asia’s  questions. 
 No numbers to back it up 
 Even if an investment was made, JD.id’s user engagement numbers do not back up its claim of being a unicorn. 
 An executive at a competing company says, “We don’t bump up against JD.id much.” 
 Citing confidential data, he adds that JD.id’s user numbers are in “distant fifth” in the country and have been “static” year-on-year. 
 According to App Annie, JD.id is the 10th most popular free app on Google Play’s shopping category in Indonesia, well below its rivals. 
 “I’m not sure if [Indonesia is] still even a big focus market for them,” he says. 
 The number of visits to JD’id’s website lags far behind the country’s more popular marketplaces like Bukalapak (valued at US$2.5 billion), according to SimilarWeb’s estimates. This is despite the fact that the popular Gojek app has a tile that links directly to JD.id. 
 However, it’s worth noting that the vast majority of online shoppers buy things on mobile apps, according to a source. Still, website traffic could be a proxy for the company’s overall popularity. 
   
 Unlike Tokopedia or Shopee, JD makes deliveries only through its own logistics network – an approach that requires significant investment. That may explain why its activity, according to the executive, seems focused on the Jakarta metropolitan area, the most developed part of the country. 
 Looking at the transcripts of JD’s earnings calls over the past year, the company did not appear to have discussed its Indonesian business at all. It also doesn’t break down its international revenue as a distinct category. 
 Putting on a show? 
 Even if JD.id was somehow able to justify its hefty price tag, the timing of its confirmation seems tone-deaf, especially after investors have started to take a dim view of sky-high numbers. 
 A senior executive at an ecommerce logistics firm suggests that the figure was put out there to make JD.id seem bigger than it is. 
 “It’s like MatahariMall,” he says. The ecommerce venture, part of family-owned conglomerate Lippo Group, fizzled out after claiming that it had raised a working capital of  US$500 million . 
 The eye-popping number was later  called into question .

640357,"Future-perfect: How AI can change the future, not just predict it"," The use of artificial intelligence has grown over the years, making a difference in  an increasing number of industries  worldwide. But to fully realize the technology’s capabilities, it’s important for people to adjust their approach: instead of  using AI just to solve problems, they should start harnessing its power to ask questions . 
 One business that’s looking to revolutionize the way people use AI is  SparkBeyond . 
 Founded in 2013 by Sagie Davidovich and Ron Karidi as a moonshot experiment, the company has since built a machine that could solve the world’s most pressing concerns. 
 To do this, the Israel-based startup is banking on one thing: data. 
 “[Davidovich] had a great vision, and [he] basically said, ‘How can we harness humanity’s collective intelligence to solve the most complex problems?’” shares Amir Haramaty, SparkBeyond’s chief commercial officer.

 According to the CCO, data scientists often spend up to 80% of their time cleaning data, and sometimes, important information gets lost in the process. 
 SparkBeyond’s engine generates hypotheses using clients’ data, identifying key drivers and patterns that can help solve pain points. And since it also uses proprietary algorithms and open-source code from the internet to index information, the engine can still produce actionable outputs even when there’s insufficient information. 
 The best thing about SparkBeyond, Haramaty explains, is the fluid nature of the engine and its ability to enter any space – all it needs is data and a problem to solve. 
 Here are three industries where SparkBeyond has sparked great change. 
 1. Making retail better 
 The retail industry  faces many challenges  in the coming years: shifts in consumer behavior, demographic changes, and increasing prices for raw materials. SparkBeyond has helped retailers across the world improve their processes through AI. 
 One of Japan’s largest convenience store chains, for instance, used the startup’s engine to generate interesting insights, such as how having a laundromat near a store can boost sales. 
 The link? Apartments in Japanese cities are small, so many young people don’t have space for their own laundry machines. As such, they spend several hours a week at laundromats, and they’re more likely to do their grocery shopping at nearby convenience stores while waiting for their clean clothes. 
 SparkBeyond also worked with  Zabka , one of the biggest retailers in Central Europe. SparkBeyond’s platform  identified key drivers behind three aspects of business operations  – pricing, product assortment, and store location optimization – allowing Zabka to improve its systems and forge ahead with its planned expansion. 
 2. Insuring the uninsurable 
 The insurance industry is ripe for disruption, says Haramaty, pointing out that a lot of startups are facing off against traditional players. 
 “One of the things we tell [traditional insurance firms] is to play to their strengths,” he shares. “The new guys don’t have as many years of domain expertise, and the amount of data you have is incredible. However, the models you are using are completely outdated.” 
 Through its work with one of the world’s leading global insurers, SparkBeyond has helped make the process of getting term life insurance much easier, both for the providers and the customers. 
 Previously, only 6% of the US-based insurer’s customers were able to get coverage without any further  invasive testing . By using SparkBeyond’s engine, the company began to understand and assess risk differently and was able to automate the process for 35% of the population. 
 The AI company’s services have also helped this global company insure people who are commonly thought uninsurable. For example, it recently issued term life insurance to a 69-year-old man, even though it’s generally more difficult for older individuals to get coverage. 
 “Life expectancy is moving up constantly, and there’s no reason – if you’re a healthy 70-year-old 
person – that you should not be able to get term life insurance,” Haramaty explains. 
 This approach to risk assessment has opened up many more business avenues within the insurance industry.

 3. Saving energy for energy companies 
 An Indonesian coal mining firm had to contend with operational challenges, and one such problem was fuel inefficiency, which SparkBeyond was able to identify and target. 
 This large mining company had begun offering incentives for its drivers based on the number of trips they completed. That meant drivers weren’t waiting for their trucks to be fully loaded before making a trip – a practice that led to wasted fuel. 
 SparkBeyond’s platform revealed actionable insights, such as gamifying the process and listing the steps as items to check off on an app. These measures can streamline the system and reduce fuel consumption by 30%. 
 Enabling a better world 
 SparkBeyond has expanded across the globe since its inception, opening offices in Singapore, London, New York, and Melbourne as it strives to make a difference . 
 “Impact for us is not just business,” explains Haramaty. “Impact is also social, so we collectively have a bigger responsibility as citizens of this planet.” 
 SparkBeyond often runs social projects on top of commercial ones with its clients, whether it’s assisting a beverage company decrease plastic pollution or powering climate action. 
 These initiatives are done in the spirit of partnership, according to Arun Poojari, SparkBeyond’s general manager for Asia Pacific and Japan. “We empower clients to eventually do this on their own.” 
 Ultimately, SparkBeyond hopes that its platform can continue to be helpful in addressing a variety of issues. 
 Having received  accreditation  from the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore in March 2019, the SparkBeyond team wants to assist the government to look at matters such as diabetes and housing prices. 
 “The next frontier is knowledge. It’s about pushing further and changing the future, instead of just predicting it,” Haramaty says. 
 
 SparkBeyond uses artificial intelligence to tackle the world’s most complex challenges. Based in Israel, it aims to harness humanity’s collective intelligence to solve pain points and improve businesses.

640467,Indonesia’s stunning growth doesn’t tell the full story,"     
 ||item|| 
 ABOUT 
  A recent  report  by East Ventures found that Java, where Indonesia’s capital Jakarta is located, leads the country in digital competitiveness. (Disclosure: EV is an investor in  Tech in Asia .)  
 The study assessed the archipelago’s 34 provinces based on these indicators: human resources, use and spending for information and communications technology, entrepreneurship and productivity, manpower, economics, infrastructure, financial inclusivity, and regulations. 
 WHY IT MATTERS 
  The report also highlighted the challenges that stand in the way of unlocking Indonesia’s full potential.  
 Outside of Java, internet connection remains spotty and slow. The nation’s education system has been struggling to train people that can excel in internet companies. 
 Productivity remains low among businesses, which means they’re less motivated to adopt efficient digital tools. A lack of financing options also hampers Indonesian entrepreneurs and hurts their cash flow. 
 But instead of seeing these issues as obstacles, startups and conglomerates can consider them as opportunities to tackle serious problems and make a real difference in the country. It’s precisely why analysts think that Indonesia’s digital economy can  hit US$130 billion by 2025 .

640444,Nium turns global amid tighter regulations in home market," The evolution of firms into financial service providers has been a boon for fintech enablers. These days, “everybody wants to be a fintech,” Prajit Nanu, co-founder and CEO of open money platform Nium (formerly Instarem), says. 
 To do so, these fintech hopefuls are roping in infrastructure-as-a-service companies to help them build out relevant capabilities and circumvent costly and time-consuming processes. It’s a big opportunity  Nium  is banking on.

 The startup, which began as a consumer-focused remittance company in 2015, lets companies ride on its financial infrastructure to perform tasks ranging from cross-border payments and card issuance to foreign exchange and treasuries. It has seen its enterprise business scale rapidly in the last four years, prompting a  rebrand  last October. 
 In 2019, Nium handled US$5 billion worth of transactions for consumers and enterprises across the globe – a number it expects to triple this year. “We’re doing so much more than remittances [now],” Nanu says. 
 ‘Unnecessary complexity’ 
 Recent regulatory changes in its home market of Singapore such as the Payments Services Act may see the use of digital wallets – which Nium provides for both its retail and enterprise customers – curtailed. 
 Nanu says the act introduces  “unnecessary complexity” in the ecosystem. 
 Aimed at addressing the risks that come with new payment methods, the act places a S$30,000 (US$21,500) cap on the amount of transactions flowing out of personal stored-value facilities such as e-wallets. It also imposes a limit of S$5,000 (US$3,600) for balances in such facilities at any given time. 
 “These caps help to further protect customers by limiting a customer’s potential loss from his e-money account,” Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung said in January 2019 during the second reading of the Payments Services Bill. “More importantly, the caps will ensure continued stability of the financial system by reducing the risk of significant outflows from bank deposits to non-bank e-money, which can undermine the stability of our banks.” 
 Nanu says that while the new rules do not affect Nium’s money transfer operations, they limit the number of customers that Nium’s enterprise clients can serve. 
 “Prior to this, we could provide anyone with a  neobanking  experience. For example, using our infrastructure, a Grab or Gojek customer could launch a bank by giving customers a virtual account number. Suddenly, they can only onboard people whose salaries are less than S$30,000 a year,” he explains.

 The changes similarly impact other fintech companies such as cross-border money transfer company  TransferWise , which has Singapore as its Asia-Pacific headquarters. 
 “The TransferWise multicurrency account […] has been used to receive salaries, pay rent, fund mortgages (especially overseas ones), and hold study abroad fees,” CEO Kristo Kaarmann wrote  in a commentary  last month. “These are real use cases by TransferWise customers in Singapore who will see their use curtailed.” 
 Prioritizing global 
 Against a backdrop of such changes, Nium is stepping up its global diversification efforts. 
 Nium’s expansion will increasingly be focused on overseas markets – such as Latin America and Malaysia – where the company already derives a significant portion of its revenues. “The fact is that spending capacity and urgency [by companies towards innovation] is higher in Western markets than in Asian markets,” Nanu says. 
 When the Monetary Authority of Singapore opened bids for digital banking licenses last year, Nium raised its hands in earnest, only to pull out months later. Although a digital wholesale banking license would have made sense for the business in theory, “we couldn’t figure out how to make money,” Nanu says. 
 “The challenge would have been building something in a market which is not big enough and is extremely competitive,” he adds. “We don’t want to focus on a domestic market when the opportunities for revenue lie in our other markets.” 
 The company, however, is open to applying for a similar license in another market such as Mexico, says Nanu. 
 Helping fintechs ‘bolt’ 
 Nium’s open money network makes sense for startups or financial companies looking to scale into multiple markets globally. “Once you plug into our card-issuing API (application programming interface) in Singapore, tomorrow you can issue cards in Europe, Australia, and multiple markets,” Nanu explains. 
 The startup currently counts budget hotel network  Zen Rooms , ecommerce marketplace  Zilingo , Kasikornbank, and Cambodia’s PhillipBank among its clients. 
 Last November, it inked a partnership with Brazilian forex broker Frente Corretora de Cambio to process outbound money transfers to the US for Frente’s clients, starting with retail customers. Individual remittances are a growing market, with overall outbound remittances from Brazil exceeding US$2 billion, according to Frente partner Ricardo Baraçal. 
 Nium is now opening up access to its infrastructure on a wider scale. Earlier this month, the company launched  Bolt , a 26-week innovation program aimed at helping fellow fintech firms to rapidly build their apps and roll out their prototypes.

 “Every country you want to expand into, you need a license. Each license is a 12 to 18-month period. The idea is, instead of waiting five to seven years – the time we’ve taken to acquire licenses – why not leverage our platform and build something fairly rapidly?” Nanu says. 
 Nium’s multicountry network of licenses helps companies circumvent the complex, costly, and lengthy process of obtaining local licenses overseas. Outside Singapore, Nium holds licenses to operate in the US, Europe, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and India. 
 “The technology, licensing, rules, and regulations – we already have,” Nanu says. “We already do what we do as part of Bolt with some large corporations.” 
 Bolt plans to bring in corporate partners – including those from consulting and tech firms – over the next few months. While the program runs only in Singapore at the moment, Nium aims to make it globally accessible so that startups in Europe could use it to launch services in the US or Asia and vice versa. 
 As a business enabler, Nium’s global network of licenses is crucial. Rather than growing out its network of licenses overseas indefinitely, Nanu says he intends to focus on strategic markets such as Mexico and augment its presence in Malaysia and Hong Kong. 
 The CEO is also optimistic about the upcoming developments in his company this year. For one, Nium will be expanding its card-issuing capabilities, with a corporate partner launching a new travel card next month. 
 “This will be an interesting model,” Nanu says. “They will acquire the customers, but we will provide the back-end support.” 
 The company will also be scouting acquisitions in various parts of the world to enhance its core capabilities. “We’re trying to grow inorganically this year,” Nanu says. “It’s either going to give us an enhancement to our existing product or it’s going to give us a new market.”
